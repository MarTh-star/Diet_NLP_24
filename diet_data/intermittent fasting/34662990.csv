0,abstract0," Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are first-line treatments in the management of advanced solid tumors. Whereas these treatments are directed at eliminating cancer cells, they cause significant adverse effects that can be detrimental to a patient’s quality of life and even life-threatening. Diet is a modifiable risk factor that has been shown to affect cancer risk, recurrence, and treatment toxicity, but little information is known how diet interacts with cancer treatment modalities. Although dietary interventions, such as intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets, have shown promise in pre-clinical studies by reducing the toxicity and increasing the efficacy of chemotherapeutics, there remains a limited number of clinical studies in this space. This review surveys the impact of dietary interventions (caloric restriction, intermittent and short-term fasting, and ketogenic diet) on cancer treatment outcomes in both pre-clinical and clinical studies.",58341e00-741a-4a52-a844-f865756aea7f

2,abstract2," Introduction  Chemotherapy (CT) and radiation therapy, also known as radiotherapy (RT), are commonly used in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. CT has its origins in the early twentieth century with the first primitive CT drugs consisting of early aniline dyes and alkylating agents. Both of these were developed by German chemist Paul Ehrlich, who himself coined the term “chemotherapy” [1]. Despite the advent of CT, RT and surgical interventions remained at the forefront of cancer care during the twentieth century, until the development of modern CT drugs that were less toxic and more efficacious. CT drugs saw a resurgence in their use at the beginning of the 1960s, with the development of the L1210 leukemia system for treating acute leukemia, with 25% of the cases among children going into complete remission [1]. This success propelled CT back into the spotlight as a viable avenue of research and treatment.",1d5092f4-4144-4354-a41c-f5687e9ca83b
3,abstract3," With the rise of adjuvant CT regimens in the 1970s, CT was established as a feasible method of cancer treatment with extremely beneficial results [1,2].  CT inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells in many cases by inducing DNA damage, but in other cases by interfering with the cytoskeleton (microtubules, etc.) to inhibit cell division, either causing considerable oxidative stress that is induced via the effects on the mitochondrial function [3]. In many typical CT regimens, such as the administration of platinum agents such as cisplatin, the damage that is caused to DNA by oxidative stress is often mimicked through the formation of intra- and inter-strand DNA cross-links, thereby forming DNA adducts that prevent the DNA replication that is similar to the impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage [4].",160cf700-1e98-4c3b-8089-69192d4bea53
4,abstract4,"  Radiation therapy, or radiotherapy (RT), has been a mainstay in the treatment of most cancers for over a century, with nearly 50% of all of the cancer patients receiving some form of RT through the duration of their illness [5]. In some cases, RT is given in tandem or sequentially in combination with various types of CT agents, with the goal of creating a synergistic effect [6]. Whereas these regimens can be effective in the eradication of cancerous tumors, adverse effects are well documented, and these can limit the treatment duration and cause significant discomfort for patients [7].  While RT has technologically advanced dramatically in the last two decades, photon or heavy ion-based RT inevitably damages some of the normal tissue near the tumor [8]. These can be classified as acute, consequential, or late effects. Acute effects occur within the days and weeks of the initial treatment, and they often involve intermitotic cells such as the skin and mucosa.",4009553a-154f-4614-bd96-10ddd47d7a2e
5,abstract5," These effects are often the source of considerable suffering for patients. The consequential effects of RT have similar symptoms as the acute effects do, but they emerge when the acute effects are not properly treated or mitigated. Finally, late effects result from the loss of the function of the postmitotic cells, such as those of the brain, spinal cord, kidney, and vascular structures, and typically, they can emerge up to years after the initial exposure [9].  One of the main mechanisms by which RT kills cancer cells is by generating an increase in the local oxidative stress. In the context of cancer RT and CT treatments, this aspect of oxidative stress can directly take advantage of the Warburg effect, a mechanism by which cancerous cells experience a metabolic shift to rely upon glycolysis for ATP generation [10,11,12], in contrast to the healthy cells that rely primarily on oxidative phosphorylation for the generation of ATP.",d17d58f3-c618-451b-9c6d-5a814f5bd9a3
6,abstract6," The importance of this oxidative stress can be shown when antioxidants are deliberately administered within RT regimens. The primary function of antioxidants is to eliminate the reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), the main perpetrators of oxidative stress, and some studies have suggested that antioxidants can therefore decrease the efficacy of the radiation treatment [13].  Oxidative stress can be modulated in somatic cells in a limited and controlled manner through the alterations of an organism’s diet [14]. In a study of in vivo and in vitro colon carcinoma models, 48 h cycles of short-term starvation (short term starvation (STS)) feeding exerted an anti-Warburg effect [15]. This anti-Warburg effect was accomplished by forcing normally glycolysis-dependent cancer cells to use oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP.",4cd4a188-14c8-4e92-9bea-87054f3e5743
7,abstract7," As many cancer cells and cell lines possess malfunctioning mitochondria and electron transport chains, oxidative phosphorylation is often inefficient and partially uncoupled by ATP synthesis. This results in oxidative damage occurring to the cancer cells and possible apoptosis [15]. Recent studies in animal models have demonstrated that metabolic based therapies, such as ketogenic diet, caloric restriction, and intermittent fasting may decrease the overall occurrence of spontaneous primary tumors and slow the growth of already existing primary tumors [16].  Briefly, caloric restriction (CR) can be defined as a net energy deficit in an individual’s consumption of food as measured by their caloric intake.",af73c8bd-131a-45d0-9229-bc5aaa02a6d9
8,abstract8," The benefits of CR in the context of cancer prevention and treatment have been documented for well over a century, with Moreschi first describing that the tumors that were transplanted into the underfed mice did not grow as well as those that were transplanted in the mice that were fed ad libitum (AL) in 1909 [17]. This deficit in caloric intake is generally set between 20% and 40% of the energy consumption from an organism’s initial average intake [18,19,20]. A lower caloric threshold of CR must be defined to prevent the occurrence of under-nutrition or malnutrition. Reaching these nutritional states is likely to counteract many of the known cancer prevention benefits that CR is known to provide [20].",8db99b9c-2f4d-4017-8305-04e8f803f9e7
9,abstract9,"  Intermittent fasting (IF), or as it is often referred to in the scientific community, the time-restricted diet (time restricted diet (TRD)), is a form of dietary intervention which sets limits on the amount of time an individual is allowed to intake calories, as opposed to the content or number of calories that they consume. This has been hypothesized to improve caloric expenditure and perhaps importantly, encourage the body’s use of stored fatty acids [21]. Unfortunately, the exact number of hours that is optimal remains controversial, but studies have examined the fasts lasting from as little as 12 h to as many as 24 h. A variant of IF is “short-term starvation” (short term starvation (STS)), which can require the individuals to fast over several days.",68c957b7-2477-4746-9626-f11ce384aef5
10,abstract10," Because short term starvation (STS) can be difficult to undertake for most individuals, many studies have instead examined short term starvation (STS), which permits a small amount of regulated caloric intake and is often referred to as fasting-mimicking diets (fasting mimicking diets (FMD)) [22]. Many studies on IF and short term starvation (STS) have been encouraging. On a daily regimen of fasting for 18 h, the induction of fatty acid metabolism to ketones have been linked to improvements in dyslipidemia and blood pressure [21]. Preliminary studies that have been performed on animal models have shown promise in the use of IF to improve the treatment outcomes of cancers in transgenic and transplant mouse models of neuroblastoma, fibrosarcoma, glioma, melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers [19].  In contrast, a ketogenic diet (KD) severely limits the consumption of carbohydrates to induce ketosis, thereby forcing the body primarily to mobilize stored fatty acids for its energy needs.",6e3b5407-e615-4e7a-b01a-ef05fd53128b
11,abstract11," To induce ketosis, one must consume primarily calories in the form of fats in tandem with an extremely low-carbohydrate diet (usually <20–50 g) that is supplemented with adequate amounts of protein [23]. KD is not a new concept and has been used successfully to treat disorders such as intractable epilepsy [24,25]. However, a true KD is a challenging diet to maintain durably due to the extremely limited dietary intake of carbohydrates that are required for an individual to remain in ketosis. The effects of KD on the prevention and treatment of cancers have been examined by multiple studies, with one recent study reporting that it can reduce inflammation, a well-known contributor to cancer risk [26].  In this review, we will discuss the potential therapeutic benefits of dietary interventions including CR, IF, and KD among cancer patients who were undergoing RT and/or CT (Figure 1).",a135ed70-00fb-46d8-aefd-2f4bb547c166
12,abstract12," We will clarify the potential benefits of these dietary interventions in both the attenuation of the acute clinical symptoms resulting from CT and RT, as well as the potential increases in the efficacy of these therapies (Table 1). We have also included preclinical in vivo studies that have been performed on murine models as well as in vitro cellular models to explore the relationships of said dietary interventions and metabolism (Table 2). Finally, we will discuss the current limitations and explore the directions for future research.  2. ",8c5ac29c-4ff4-457c-8d9f-08e707134eff

15,methods2," Dietary Interventions  3.1. Caloric Restriction and Fasting-Mimicking Diets Assist in Further Attenuating Tumor Growth with CT/RT Treatment Regimens  As noted previously, CR represents the reduction in the gross number of calories that are consumed daily, which is generally to less than 20–30% of the normal caloric intake [52]. This diet has a well-established effect of decreasing the overall presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) among the somatic cells, likely resulting from the activation of the eNOS pathway via SIRT1 upregulation [14]. CR has been associated with tumor growth attenuation and progression, with experiments in rodent models indicating that CR can reduce the vascular density of tumors [41] (Table 2). In a pilot study, Tang et al. examined the effect of short-term caloric restriction (short term caloric restriction (SCR)) among patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)) receiving R-CHOP CT [37] (Table 1).",39d6e893-7e0c-43ab-a7ef-24ade6902ee0
16,methods3," In line with previous studies, the patients who underwent either a 48 h short term caloric restriction (SCR) or a normocaloric diet. They utilized a newer technique to approximate the nutritional disease and outcome known as a phase angle, where a phase angle that is greater than 5° shows better health outcomes [53]. In this study, the patients’ phase angles within the short term caloric restriction (SCR) group increased from 4.92° to 5.4° and displayed stable prealbumin levels throughout the R-CHOP cycles [37]. These results suggested that short term caloric restriction (SCR) did not negatively impact the patient’s nutritional status. Further, the short term caloric restriction (SCR) cohort had a significant increase in the post-CT hematological parameters, such as an increased erythrocyte count [37].  CR has also been found to enhance the immunogenic effect of RT through the downregulation of regulatory T-cells [18].",0ab8869c-46ff-49ff-ab8a-7f77ce4c4582
17,methods4," While cellular senescence has a strong correlation with the prevalence of the tumor immune response, CR could potentially help to modulate this. When comparing T cell priming between young and aged animal models, CR was able to mitigate the age-associated effects in CD4+ T cell priming [46]. In addition to these immunotherapeutic effects, cancer cells have been shown to compete with lymphocytes, among other cell types, for glucose [54]. It is possible that the acute immune response that is induced by RT alongside CR could increase the rate of glycolysis in CD8+ T cells, thereby potentially depleting the amount of glucose that is available in the tumor microenvironment.  In one trial using murine models, a 30% CR was correlated with tumor regression when it was compared to the control group that was allowed to eat AL. Those tumors in the CR animals showed greater rates of apoptosis and less proliferation at a cellular level [54] (Table 2).",a7553875-a092-4768-955c-11893e3579f5
18,methods5," Another study of mice that were preconditioned for 10 days with 30% CR found that the pretreatment was associated with restored hematogenic organs and an improved intestinal architecture after RT [45].  In a phase II trial, Lugtenberg et al. analyzed QoL in breast cancer patients either in a fasting-mimicking diet (4-day plant-based one, low-level amino acid diet) or a normal diet utilizing EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-BR23 questionnaires prior to each CT cycle [22] (Table 1). An analysis revealed no difference in the QoL scores between the fasting-mimicking diet and the normal diet [22]. After performing a per-protocol analysis, those who were adherent to the fasting-mimicking diet showed an increase in their physical, emotional, and cognitive well-being with lower fatigue and nausea scores when they were compared to the normal diet and non-adherent groups [22].  Interestingly, there may also be sex-based differences in the response to CR.",c19fc682-5727-4217-852d-8fb18b9809ca
19,methods6," In a study utilizing mouse models, CR mitigated the radiation-induced systemic and intestinal inflammation in females, while the male mice showed an improved gut barrier function [45] (Table 2). These differences were also reflected in the composition of their respective gut microbiomes, whereby the males had an enrichment of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. The females, conversely, showed a marked deficiency in the microbes that are associated with the pro-inflammatory pathways. The administration of antibiotics to the 30% CR group of mouse models negated these benefits [45]. It has been previously established that altering the gut microbiome profiles may impact the cancer incidence and treatment response [55]. This finding suggests that future research into the relationship between diet modulation and the effects on RT will need to consider the gut microbiome composition as a potential factor in enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of it or the reduction in the side effects.",ff5cb33d-a45c-492f-a0b6-9314c2d19a57
20,methods7,"  Despite the potential benefits of CR, this dietary intervention is difficult to sustain for most patients [56], particularly because many cancer patients are at risk of excessive weight loss or malnutrition. Because there is a high patient attrition to the CR diet, the pharmacologic methods that target the molecular pathways which are induced by CR may be particularly useful alternatives. Caloric restriction mimetics are a class of drug/dietary supplement that can mimic the metabolic and hormonal effects of caloric restriction, without the denial of the access to essential nutrients. One example of this is 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), a glucose analogue that lacks a hydroxyl group at C2. 2DG can be phosphorylated by hexokinase in the initial step of glycolysis, but it is unable to be metabolized by phospho-hexose isomerase, and thus, it competitively inhibits glucose utilization. This eventually leads to elevated SIRT1 and p-AMPK protein levels [57].",4fff560a-9e17-4270-ace0-6256fad20045
21,methods8," Though there is insufficient evidence in humans, in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical studies have shown that they successfully mimicked the reduction in the progression and growth of tumors, which was observed in the CR studies [57,58].  Finally, CR diets have been shown to be safe and feasible for patients who were undergoing cancer treatments, so long as the patient’s nutrition is monitored and accounted for. Valdemarin et al. conducted a phase I/II study examining a CR fasting-mimicking diet (fasting mimicking diets (FMD)) among patients who were undergoing cancer treatment including CT, RT, immunotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)s, and other biologics [38] (Table 1). With a total of 81 patients who were enrolled, 62 patients adhered to the fasting mimicking diets (FMD) diet, 31 patients displayed grade 1–2 symptoms, and the patients’ body compositions remained stable throughout the treatment regimen [38].",c66c8ed6-a890-4690-a748-6658a96f13a5
22,methods9," From these data, they were able to show that the fasting mimicking diets (FMD) diet was safe and feasible for the cancer patients who were enrolled. Additionally, they showed a significant reduction in the c-peptide, IGF1, IGFBP3, and leptin levels [38]. A reduction in these circulating growth factors including adipokines, cytokines, and chemokines have been shown to enhance CT and targeted drug therapy efficacy in the PI3K-mTOR pathway [59]. Two other biomarkers, adiponectin and IGFBP1, have been shown to be inversely proportional to the cancer prognosis. When analyzing the peptide levels several weeks after the fasting mimicking diets (FMD) regimen, adiponectin and IGFBP1 remained high, suggesting a persistent benefit of fasting mimicking diets (FMD) [38]. Further research is needed to understand how fasting mimicking diets (FMD) can affect the tumor growth over longer periods of time.",ab117477-d97c-4ca3-84a6-6e22fa53e8d2
23,methods10,"  Although it is effective in increasing the treatment efficacy, CR has been shown to be much more difficult to implement as a supplementary dietary intervention in assisting in the CT/RT treatment regimens. This is likely due to the demanding toll that these regimens have on cancer patients. It is because of this and the existence of potential alternatives that the benefits of CR during CT/RT do not outweigh the deleterious effects of it. While fasting mimicking diets (FMD) has shown some promise in potentially ameliorating this, the current research is not sufficient to support large-scale clinical trials.  3.2. Intermittent Fasting Is a Safe and Feasible Way of Increasing the Efficacy of CT/RT Treatment as Well as Decreasing Treatment Toxicity  In contrast to the CR, intermittent fasting (IF), or a time-restricted diet (time restricted diet (TRD)), is a dietary intervention that restricts the duration of the feeding time, and this is followed by periods of prolonged fasting [21].",20a332a0-9052-4167-9283-7a3ae858af8e
24,methods11," These periods of fasting can vary from more than 24 h periods (often referred to as short-term starvation or short term starvation (STS)) to periods of only 12 or more hours [60]. As early as 1982, the studies of murine models showed that a 24 h fasting/feeding period improved the radioresistance to whole-body irradiation, as the dietary intervention was correlated with increased survival rates [61]. In the studies of in vitro human liver cell lines, HepG2 and HuH6, the results displayed that there was a notably increased radiosensitivity under the nutrient-starved conditions (Table 2). This was attributed to an increase in mTORC1 activity, which directly correlated with an increase in the radiosensitivity [47]. A further study examined the effects of starvation on glioma cells both in vitro, utilizing murine, rat, and human lines, and in vivo using only mouse models [44] (Table 2).",905f5be9-966a-4107-a29d-5533e20596a3
25,methods12," All of the subjects tested underwent a 48 h period of short term starvation (STS), mimicking the starvation conditions, thereby causing a significant reduction in the blood glucose and IGF-1 levels. The reductions in glucose in vitro were strongly correlated with an increased sensitization of the tumor tissue to both RT and CT. In vivo, the short term starvation (STS) mice had a significantly lower tumor burden and higher rates of survival after the intracranial GL26 glioma implantation when it was performed in adjunction with Temozolomide (Temozolomide (TMZ)). However, the standard 48 h short term starvation (STS) cycle and the higher Temozolomide (TMZ) dosage were poorly tolerated. Shortening the fasting cycle to 24 h and reducing the Temozolomide (TMZ) treatments to just one injection per day prevented the occurrence of an apparent weakness, allowed for the mice to maintain adequate bodyweight, and delayed the onset of tumor-induced mortality [44].",97b0ccba-5e50-4ab2-85be-685045474b9c
26,methods13,"  One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that fasting, even for short periods of time, can induce an anti-Warburg effect. This is likely mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a central regulator of glycolysis, whose activation has been associated with angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and the modulation of notable enzymes within aerobic glycolysis [62]. Using a murine xenograft model of CT26 carcinoma cells that were subjected to fasting conditions, the researchers showed a decreased ability of the tumor cells to metabolically adapt, thereby resulting in higher rates of oxidative damage and tumor cell apoptosis [15]. Alternate day short term starvation (STS) has also been shown to significantly increase the radiosensitivity among the mouse models of mammary tumors. This is likely due to the increased amount of oxidative stress that is placed on the cancer cells, with the consequence of DNA damage, relative to the surrounding non-cancerous cells [63,64].",2bc36995-ba93-49fa-b8c7-fc13c7e6898f
27,methods14,"  Alongside the potential benefits during RT, IF has been investigated in combination with CTs for many years. In mice and yeast models, 48 h short term starvation (STS) was associated with a reduction in the hematological toxicity that occurs after CT use, increased rate of DNA repair, and an increased treatment efficacy in combating metastatic neuroblastoma cells [39] (Figure 2; Table 2). In a randomized pilot study of dietary modulation among 13 HER2-negative breast cancer patients receiving CT, de Groot and colleagues demonstrated that a 48 h short-term fasting period was a feasible method of reducing bone marrow toxicity, as measured by the lymphocyte count and the CT-induced DNA damage in the healthy cells [30] (Figure 2; Table 1).",56440684-ea1c-46da-9138-025af87fab2d
28,methods15," In this same study, however, no significant difference was observed in the grade I/II and grade III/IV clinical toxicity between the control and the short term starvation (STS) patients, which is likely due to the limited power and limited rate of the patients’ adherence to the study [30]. In another randomized control study, Dorff et al. showed safety and feasibility for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h short term starvation (STS) in patients who were undergoing CT, and they also found that in the 48 h and 72 h short term starvation (STS) cohorts, there was a decreased rate of DNA damage in the leukocytes when they were compared to the 24 h cohort and baseline [31] (Table 1).  Following de Groot and Dorff’s studies, Bauersfeld et al. conducted a crossover pilot study examining the effects of short term starvation (STS) on the quality of life (QoL) of ovarian and breast cancer patients who were undergoing CT [34] (Table 1).",3eb7cac0-a673-4a91-a431-03df6d1a878b
29,methods16," QoL is defined as the physical and psychological well-being of the patient, and previous studies have shown that there is an association between QoL and the patient’s prognosis in different cancers [65]. The patients followed either a 60 h fasting protocol (36 h fast prior to the treatment and 24 h fast after the treatment) or they were provided a normocaloric diet for their first three CT cycles before they switched over to the fasting diet for the following three cycles. The patients completed questionaries such as the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general (FACT-G) one and the trial outcome index of the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (TOI FACIT-F) on to measure the QoL and fatigue scores, respectively. Among the group that initially fasted, significant increases in the FACT-G and TOI FACIT-F scores, as compared to those of the normocaloric cycle, were reported.",a9366889-186e-4dd7-8284-66e2dd313636
30,methods17," Despite this, there was no significant difference in the QoL values among those who fasted after the study cross-over [34]. Bauersfeld suggested that fasting may only be protective when it is employed prior to the onset of the symptoms. Despite this discrepancy, a 60 h short term starvation (STS) was still associated with an improved QoL and a reduced amount of fatigue as compared to those of the normocaloric diet regimen across both of the cohorts [34]. Like Bauersfeld et al.’s protocol, Riedinger et al. conducted a randomized control study analyzing the QoL scores of women with gynecological cancers who were undergoing CT [60] (Table 1). Here, they randomly assigned the patients to the short-term fasting cohort (24 h prior to treatment and 24 h after treatment) or the control AL cohort.",fdc5024c-fb60-4147-8a55-33396f6428eb
31,methods18," From their results, they found that fasting was well-tolerated, improved the patient QoL over the course of the cycles, and even showed a trend in reduced hospitalizations and improved hematological parameters [60].  Whereas the metabolic consequences of IF and short term starvation (STS) on the tumors have been well-documented, the potential alleviation of CT/RT side effects remains to be fully elucidated. One study among a small cohort of 10 patients who were undergoing CT showed that they experienced benefits from the implementation of a fasting regimen. Six of the ten patients reported a reduction in the fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal side effects after fasting prior to CT [66] (Table 1). A cross-over pilot study showed that the patients who were undergoing a 96 h fasting regimen had reduced the amount of stomatitis, nausea, and other chemotherapeutic toxicities when they were compared to the normal diet group [49] (Table 1).",efd4d834-322f-4b18-8874-05564595b84a
32,methods19," Interestingly, conflicting data exist on the effect of IF on specific cellular signaling pathways between the different cell lines. A retrospective cohort study showed no improvement of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)) efficacy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)) who were implementing an IF diet [27]. However, an in vivo murine study found that IF potentiates the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)’s activity in mice that were implanted with human hepatocellular carcinoma cells [67] (Table 2). These studies underscore that IF and short term starvation (STS) have the potential to reduce the treatment toxicity in patients who were undergoing cancer treatment, yet the mechanism by which these dietary interventions affect the differing types of cancer in the human patients requires further prospective human studies.  3.3.",c6c7f120-b615-44bc-85d9-3a257f2d4d7c
33,methods20," Ketogenic Diet Has Been Shown to Maintain Non-Fat Body Mass and Increase CT/RT Treatment Efficacy in Murine Models and Human Cancer Patients  The ketogenic diet (KD) has been the subject of numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, utilizing many different cell lines of various cancers and mouse models. We will, however, discuss both isocaloric KD and KD, which were administered at a caloric deficit. What demarcates KD from the previously mentioned diets is the specificity with which a potential patient must adhere to certain types of food, as well as the induction of a state of ketosis [68].  In line with previously noted diets, the KD-driven ketosis increases the amount of oxidative stress throughout the body via the increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation. This also facilitates a significant drop in the amount of available blood glucose for any glycolysis-reliant cancer cells.",913e7536-f116-4f4d-9ab5-696bc3c760e7
34,methods21," The depletion of glucose could especially be vital to the treatment of glycolysis-dependent cancers in the brain. Here, ketone bodies are primarily utilized in a state of glucose depletion, as fats and proteins cannot cross the blood–brain barrier [29]. The proposed anti-Warburg mechanism would allow for the selective increase in the radiosensitivity among the cancer cells when they are compared to the healthy cells [55].  KD has been noted to exhibit complimentary effects when it is implemented in combination with RT and/or CT in both the isocaloric and calorically restrictive forms. In murine models with Mia PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer xenografts, mice that were fed with a 4:1 KetoCal diet were significantly more likely to survive after 150 days of ongoing RT regimens than their AL contemporaries were, which were receiving the same RT [33] (Table 2).",86fe5c70-66b3-438f-8101-038b1a0640fd
35,methods22," In the clinical trials that were conducted on patients with a histological diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, a combination of RT, CT, and KD were used consecutively (Table 1). Only two patients were able to successfully comply with the intervention; the remaining patients withdrew due to an intolerance to the diet or a dose-limiting toxicity to it. Additionally, many studies have demonstrated the challenge of KD about compliance and tolerability among patients with varying cancer types. Compliance was defined as the patients being able to fully maintain the diet through all of the cycles of CT and/or the entire duration of their RT treatments [69]. In another study that was conducted among 16 cancer patients with advanced metastatic diseases of varying types, no severe side effects of implementing the diet were observed, except for temporary constipation and fatigue (Table 1).",8e390e19-56a3-4fc4-8d1c-ab7daaa416ab
36,methods23," However, patients who were experiencing diarrhea before because of their treatment reproved normalized bowel movements shortly after ketosis was induced [28].  The rationale of utilizing KD concurrently with CT or RT rests on the belief that such a diet will sufficiently drop the blood glucose levels to induce ketosis. Previous studies have suggested that many types of cancer cells are not able to utilize these ketone bodies effectively as sources of metabolic fuel, notably neuroblastoma cells, in addition to other brain tumor cells [43]. The presence of a certain type of ketone body, β-HB, has been associated with the inhibition of HDAC activity, contributing to its known protective effects against oxidative stress [70]. However, one study suggested that certain cancers may still be able to function in these low-glucose, high-ketone body environments.",7f71fc06-a544-451d-86a1-2a417ee57ad5
37,methods24," In murine models, KD mice with HeLa cell xenografts had an increased measured tumor growth with a decreased survival in the context of a KD diet (Table 2). In contrast, the mice with PANC-1 xenograft tumors appeared to benefit from KD, with them having vastly inhibited tumor growth and increased survivability [50]. This study also suggested that the ketolytic enzyme expression levels may account for whether a tumor cell will be able to metabolize the ketone bodies. In this way, the level at which the ketolytic enzymes were expressed in each line of tumors could determine how a given tumor cell line would respond to the KD conditions during CT and RT. Higher levels of the ketolytic enzyme expression resulted in worsened therapeutic responses and even increased rates of tumor growth.  Few studies have examined KD and its potential to modulate the side effects that are associated with CT and RT.",a47da2d5-8924-4d22-b250-a783bfb92c26
38,methods25," Those that exist tend to be case studies or involve small sample sizes (≤16 patients), and the results of them have been inconsistent regarding any changes in the severity of the treatment-related side effects. For example, De Groot and colleagues [30] found no significant differences in the symptoms in the context of CT among those on a KD when they were compared to the control groups. In contrast, Schmidt et al. reported improved emotional functioning and reduced rates of insomnia among the patients who were on a KD shortly before, during, and after the CT treatments [28] (Table 1). Existing research shows a general improvement in the QoL, and likely additional weight loss that is associated with KD intervention [35]. Selecting patients for whom weight loss is permissible or beneficial is important to reduce the risk of harm of excess weight loss and malnutrition in patients who are experiencing cancer-related cachexia.",7b51881e-3c44-412e-bce6-0a79da3cf86c
39,methods26," Unique to KD adjuvant therapies, however, is the fact that this weight loss is almost entirely in fat mass, and no significant changes in mass were observed in the cells that are not associated with fat storage. This maintenance of fat-free mass in patients who were undergoing KD was attributed to an increased intake of protein relative to a high-carbohydrate content diet in the control group [35]. Further investigation into the mechanism of the muscle mass preservation that is seen with KD would be an advisable avenue of future research, as would the implementation of KD in wider clinical trials.  4. Discussion  Most of the studies we identified showed some level of support for a potential benefit of CR, IF, and KD as dietary interventions in patients who were undergoing CT and/or RT. However, many limitations remain in these studies, and we urge strong caution before interpreting or attempting to apply these data with regard to clinical practice.",4cdf5109-2d58-4e34-a8bf-8b96db87158d
40,methods27," These limitations include them having small sample sizes, low rates of patient adherence to diet regimens in some studies, and high attrition rates, which contribute to the limited statistical power of these studies. To our knowledge, very limited research has been performed on humans of a sizable patient population on this subject.  Most of the trials that are reviewed here were pilot studies, meaning that the sample sizes were often much too small to achieve statistical significance and power. As a consequence of the limited sample sizes, some of these studies also included heterogenous cancer types, making their effects difficult to interpret. Despite this, there is promising work examining the possible biomarkers of the treatment efficacy regarding KD and different types of cancer [50]. There also exist many ongoing clinical trials exploring the subject of dietary intervention, with some even controlling for different variants of cancer (Table 3).",0c76908e-bfe8-47b2-97b5-1ebc1268d197
41,methods28,"  Patient adherence is obviously essential to the success of any intervention and the potential to observe its effect on the treatment outcomes, and QoL is inherently dependent on the patient’s ability to carry out the intervention. Lugtenberg et al. and de Groot et al. both found that 80% of the patients were able to adhere to the fasting-mimicking and IF diets, respectively, for the first cycle of CT. However, only around 20% of the patients adhered to these diets throughout all of the CT cycles [30,55]. Better methods of supporting patients and ensuring adherence are necessary to evaluate the clinical efficacy of dietary interventions in these patient cohorts. The involvement of nutritionists can be one method that can help the patients persevere with their diet regimen as well as maintain adequate nutrition [38].  While KD is difficult to maintain for most patients, CR appears to be even more difficult, which may be related to the prolonged caloric deficit in the CR diet.",342df89d-7feb-4dbf-b478-e366aa40e836
42,methods29," Evaluating the causes for the attrition may be difficult as studies of KD either required a caloric deficit or did not require isocaloric intake. Nevertheless, the KD studies that required a caloric deficit saw higher attrition rates than the studies of isocaloric did. Zorn et al. displayed in their pilot study that there was a high attrition rate because of the difficulty maintaining the diet and treatment [49]. In this case, closer attention must be paid to the recruitment strategies for future fasting studies to reduce the patient attrition rate and focus the studies on the patients who can undertake the challenging intervention. Overall, while the attrition rates were higher in the CR and KD studies, small-scale clinical trials of all three forms of dietary interventions have observed significant differences in the CT and RT treatment efficacy and toxicity, underscoring the need for further studies of these interventions.",a6261f70-f8ce-49a3-9e19-f37a373a54bb
43,methods30,"  Particular attention should be paid to gastrointestinal (GI) cancers as there is conflicting evidence as to whether the patients with GI cancers would derive benefits from these interventions. While these patients are prone to malnutrition and weight loss during their treatment, many are overweight due to obesity being a major risk factor for cancers of the colon, rectum, esophagus, liver, and pancreas [71]. Nguyen et al. examined how nutritional interventions improved the QoL in patients with GI cancer who were undergoing CT in Vietnam [36] (Table 1). Patients with early-stage GI cancers tend to be asymptomatic and thus this disease tends to be detected later with a poorer prognosis [72]. As a result, QoL is an important endpoint that is used to assess the treatment outcomes among those with GI cancers [65].",5d60a204-88b2-42bb-ac41-15b8b0379d46
44,methods31," When GI patients received high-protein and energy-rich diets, they had higher QoL scores when they were compared to those of the control as well as reduced adverse effects from their CT regimen [36].  Several in vivo studies have shown positive outcomes of the IF, KD, and CR diets in mice with different GI cancers [40,42,48] (Table 2). Klement et al. showed, that five out of six patients saw typical tumor regression, as seen in previous murine studies, alongside a preservation of muscle mass [32] (Table 1). In sum, there appears to be potential for using nutritional diets as an adjuvant for reducing the tumor growth and CT side effects; however, more studies are needed to investigate the functionality and underlying mechanisms of the fasting diets. Parameters such as QoL, nutritional health, and treatment outcome when one is determining the utility of these dietary modifications in the cancer treatment should be assessed as well.",06a49fec-c9ee-4a53-8946-38ef110daf8e
45,methods32," Cancer patients are often at a much greater risk of malnutrition than the general population is, especially when they are undergoing rigorous CT/RT treatments. According to the ESPEN Practical Guideline for clinical nutrition in cancer, the current evidence strongly advises against dietary provisions that restrict energy intake such as CR or CR/KD in malnourished patients [73].  The promising results that are reviewed herein provide the impetus for the further investigation of IF in the context of cancer in larger randomized clinical trial patients. CR and KD evidently have been the most difficult for cancer patients to comply with as there have been mixed patient compliance outcomes which have been reported. Further investigations are still needed among larger patient populations to better determine the validity of this claim. As a result, these diets might not be the most ideal method for dietary intervention when they are compared to IF.",284b0ebd-3629-4558-bb4b-bb12f9ab93af
46,methods33," The research that currently exists largely utilized murine and other mammal models, with there being a few pilot studies in humans. Those that have been conducted with human subjects suggest that the largest issue with the regimens of dietary modulation during radio- or CT in humans may be patient compliance as these patients are under high amounts of stress from their treatment.  Another avenue to consider would be the use of pharmacologic mimetics to replace the dietary interventions, such as a CR diet, through the inhibition of different pathways such as glycolysis and fat metabolic processes [57]. These therapeutics would likely significantly improve the rate of patient adherence. Several in vivo studies have shown the potential benefit of the previously mentioned mimetic, 2DG, as an anticancer agent inhibiting the AMPK signaling pathway [55,56]. Other studies have shown that 2DG can be quite cytotoxic, thereby causing cardiotoxicity in mice [74,75].",a2963757-9830-47b3-a5c4-24ba2dc918ea
47,methods34," It is still not fully understood if these mimetics are entirely safe in cancer patients, nor if they cause drug interactions with cancer treatments. Further pre-clinical and clinical studies are necessary to evaluate how well these mimetics induce the beneficial effects of CR, IF, or KD for patients who were undergoing cancer treatments.  Lastly, further work in the delineation of the different forms of dietary interventions and how each could affect different types of cancer should be considered. The existing studies remain heterogenous in the type of cancer, the stage of the disease, and the treatment modalities that have been examined, thus limiting the ability to draw any generalized conclusions.  5.",b7838ff4-e572-4013-aeb9-f648dd585a70
48,methods35," Conclusions  As a whole, the studies that are examined in this review show that dietary intervention such as CR, IF, or KD are feasible and have the potential to be effective in combination with standard of care oncologic therapies in improving the patients’ health, QoL, and treatment outcomes. However, further clinical trials using much larger patient populations must be conducted to explore these before they can be safely implemented in broader patient populations. Whereas pharmacologic interventions can be expensive, increase the medication burden, and are less adaptable to a broad variety of cancers and treatments, the dietary interventions are cost-effective and could be accessed by patients regardless of their socioeconomic status. In addition, these interventions allow the patient to participate in their treatment in a way that could significantly impact outcomes and encourages patient engagement and adherence.",1a0b804c-7be1-45b3-9757-c83397057a6c
49,methods36," While we await the publication of more definitive trials examining these interventions, identifying the optimal implementation strategies, identifying the patients who are most likely to benefit from them as well as exploring the ways to improve adherence will be key to advancing future interventions that can improve the patient outcomes in the clinic.

Quality of life (QoL) is a parameter that is used to determine the well-being of an individual both physically and psychologically. Reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) are unstable molecules which induce DNA damage, thereby leading to cell death.  Figure 2 Fasting’s effect on anticancer treatment toxicity. The mechanism of radiation and some chemotherapeutic drugs are largely mediated through the induction of increased levels of oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage in the cell. Most of the oxidative stress in the cell is predominately produced by physiologic metabolic processes. (A) During fasting periods in IF, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is produced by the mitochondria is significantly lower than it is during the active metabolism period.",7f33f75e-eef1-4eaf-a615-28beb7bd58b8
51,methods38," By introducing a period of short-term fasting pre- and post-cancer therapy that induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), we expect this dietary modulation to protect normal cells from excess levels of DNA damage due to DNA stress. In this case, more normal cells can repair themselves and survive, while highly metabolic cancer cells are less likely to respond to short-term fasting as they are likely undergoing apoptosis as a result of this. (B) As described by the Warburg effect, cancer cells vastly increase their uptake of glucose, developing an overreliance on glycolysis as their primary method of ATP generation. CR utilizes this lack of metabolic flexibility to disproportionately place more oxidative stress on cancer cells than they do on normal somatic cells, thereby leading to apoptosis. (C) KD is able to exploit the Warburg Effect as well through purposefully depleting serum glucose via reducing the consumption of carbohydrates.",aa119a64-4b65-42a8-8226-38ae0d271e33
52,methods39," This results in an overall increased reliance on fatty acid beta-oxidation and gluconeogenesis to provide energy and maintain appropriate serum glucose levels, effectively starving cancer cells of glucose and curbing tumor growth rates.  cancers-14-05149-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Clinical studies examining the effect of dietary interventions (CR, IF, and KD) in patients who were undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Fasting was shown to inhibit tumor growth via the reduction in M2 polarization of TAMs in mouse models. In vitro evidence reinforced this. Fasting was shown to induce cancer cell autophagy.	 Zahra et al. [33]	2017	MIA PaCa-2 injected athymic nu/nu murine models	Pancreatic	n = 6 (total), n = 3 (standard chow), n = 3 (4:1 KetoCal)	Mice injected with MIA PaCa-2 cells were fed 2 different diets: a standard isocaloric diet and a specific KetoCal diet (KD analogue). Mice were then exposed to 6 fractions of 2 Gy for 25 days. Tumor progression was measured.	KD enhanced radiation response in mouse xenograft models without increasing radiation toxicity.

LX-2 cells exposed to FM had inhibited DNA synthesis/proliferation rates. LPS managed to increase LX-2 cell proliferation by, regardless of media.	 C57BL/6J murine models	NA	n = 24 (total), n = 12 (72 h fast), n = 12 (control)	Mice were administered streptozotocin to simulate human diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)) in vivo. One group of mice fasted for 72 h, which was followed by 10 days of high fat diet refeeding.	Cyclic fasting did not have beneficial effect in reducing fibrotic burden of non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in the model.	 HepG2 and Huh-7 cell lines	Hepatoma	2 cell lines	Cytostatic ability of sorafenib was assessed for HepG2 and Huh-7 cells in either starvation-mimicking (72 h fast) or non-fasting conditions.",fd8c8025-cf77-4e74-9e10-eab62f5df1ad

[50]	2018	Various human cancer cell lines	Glioma, leukemia, pancreatic, thyroid, cervical, liver, renal, lung, gastric, colorectal, prostate, breast, and ovarian	33 cell lines	Expression levels of 4 enzymes were examined: BDH 1/2 and OXCT 1/2.	No correlation between glycolysis reliance and ketolytic enzyme quantity. BHB-supplemented HeLa cells saw improved growth rates; PANC-1 saw no change. BHB no longer benefitted HeLa growth with BDH1/OXCT1 downregulation via siRNA.	 nu/nu murine models	Pancreatic	NA	BDH1/2 and OXCT1/2 levels were investigated in PANC-1 and HeLa xenograft tumors.	In vivo KD results were consistent with in vitro data. PANC-1 xenograft tumor growth rate was heavily attenuated compared to HeLa. Mean survival of KD HeLa mice was significantly lower than that of standard diet HeLa mice.	 Manukian et al.",6dd1eee2-797d-413f-8360-7ccd6314607f
68,methods55, [18]	2019	Balb/c murine models	Triple negative breast (TNBC)	NA	Mouse models were injected with 4TI cells and randomized into AL or CR. CR mice were treated with either only CR or CR + RT (12 Gy in 3 fractions).	Increased expression activity related to integrin signaling and inflammation pathways was observed. CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3+ Tregs were significantly decreased with CR. Effector T cells from CR mice produced significantly more interferon-y than AL controls.	 Li et al. [51]	2021	C57BL/6J murine models	NA	NA	Mouse models were fed ad libitum or subjected to 30% CR before TBI or TAI treatment.	CR improved intestinal architecture and restored hematogenic organs in all mice. Male mice noted improved gut barrier function; female mice had mitigated systemic and enteric inflammation. There were notable differences in gut microbiome bacterial species enrichment in either sex.,d6221706-4aeb-45ee-8bdf-7c8c147e3322
