0,methods0," Search strategy  The Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) is widely used for bibliometric analysis, which is the most authoritative citation-based database with powerful indexing functions (10, 11). Therefore, literature related to time restricted eating (TRE) was downloaded from the WoSCC. For time restricted eating (TRE), there are two forms of expression including time restricted feeding and time restricted eating, so the search term was TS = “time restricted feeding” or “time restricted eating” or “time-restricted feeding” or “time-restricted eating.” The search results were confined by types of articles and reviews, publication data from inception to May 1, 2022, and language of English.  Data collection and analysis  The relevant records with “Full Record and Cited References” were exported in the format of “Plain Text.” The resulting set of publications was analyzed bibliometrically.",d6e61f91-571b-43c9-8542-8bd3f0788ee5

Hotspots and frontiers  Through the combination of highest cited references and analysis of all keywords co-occurrence clusters, the research hotspots and frontiers were as follows: (1) time restricted eating (TRE) and circadian rhythm. In the top 20 highest cited references, five explored the time restricted eating (TRE) and the circadian rhythm, and the keywords of circadian clock and circadian were in the green cluster (6, 17, 19, 21, 25). The rhythm internal circadian rhythms play an important role in physiology and overall health (21). Disrupted circadian rhythms would compromise health and increase the risk of disease.",c7bb6de5-68fe-4656-b2d3-afd46fa9acb8
18,discussion3," Erratic lifestyle including jet-lag, shift work and aberrant sleep and eating patterns contribute to circadian rhythm disruption, which compromises multiple levels of physiology for inflammation and metabolism, and increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, obesity and metabolic disease. Researches in rodents have demonstrated that time restricted eating (TRE) could restore robust circadian rhythms and improve health, and decrease the risk of disease to extend healthspan. (2) time restricted eating (TRE) and obesity. In the top 20 highest cited references, four explored the time restricted eating (TRE) and obesity, and the keyword of obesity was in the blue cluster (6, 14, 20, 29). Cienfuegos et al. (33) showed that 6 and 4-h time restricted feeding (TRF) could induce mild reductions in body weight and may be promising interventions for weight loss. Lowe et al.",7585b30d-95fb-4231-9746-d9969baf058d
19,discussion4," (20) demonstrated there was a significant weight loss in the time restricted eating (TRE) group but not in e consistent meal timing (consistent meal timing (CMT)) group. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the time restricted feeding (TRF) regimen had a significant weight loss compared with the unrestricted time regimen, which was mainly attributed to the loss of lean mass, not fat mass (20, 33–39). Recently, Liu et al. (40) showed that, compared with calorie restriction (CR), time restricted eating (TRE) was not more beneficial in the reduction of body weight and body fat. Thomas et al. (41) demonstrated that early time restricted eating (TRE) plus daily CR (E-time restricted eating (TRE) + DCR) resulted in similar levels of weight loss compared with DCR alone, and may be an acceptable dietary strategy.",325e6a05-aaaa-40bf-82b6-693736c96973
20,discussion5," A recent study (42) has demonstrated that 30%-CR could extend lifespan by 10% while time restricted eating (TRE) and CR act together extended lifespan by 35% in male C57BL/6J mice, and this effect was independent of body weight. Although a regimen of time restricted eating (TRE) was not more beneficial for the reduction in body weight compared with CR, the effect of time restricted eating (TRE) on other factors such as longevity should be explored in further studies. (3) time restricted eating (TRE) and metabolic disease. In the top 20 highest cited references, six explored time restricted eating (TRE) and metabolic disease, and the keywords of metabolic disease and insulin resistance were in the yellow cluster (6, 16, 24, 27, 30, 43). Wilkinson et al. (30) demonstrated that time restricted eating (TRE) could improve the cardiometabolic health of patients with metabolic syndrome and could be added to standard medical practice. Sutton et al.",ec92d678-4c09-4028-a86e-90064bcccb43
21,discussion6," (27) did the first study to prove that etime restricted feeding (TRF) could improve some aspects of cardiometabolic health which were not solely due to weight loss. In their study, they found that etime restricted feeding (TRF) could improve appetite, oxidative stress, cell responsiveness, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity in men with prediabetes. (4) time restricted eating (TRE) and cardiovascular disease. In the top 20 highest cited references, three explored time restricted eating (TRE) and cardiovascular disease, and the keyword of cardiovascular disease was in the yellow cluster (15, 24, 27). Several trails (24, 27, 43–45) have evaluated the effect of time restricted eating (TRE) on parameters of cardiovascular health including plasma lipid concentrations and blood pressure.

Strengths and limitations  This was the first study to conduct a bibliometric analysis of time restricted eating (TRE). In our study, we displayed the research status and draw visual maps, and explored trends and hotspots in this field to provide the reference for future studies. There were several limitations in our study. First, all data were extracted from the WoSCC, and other databases such as Medline and Embase were not used. Second, only studies published in English were included. Finally, bias may still exist despite our normalization procedures.
