0,background0," Polycystic ovary syndrome (Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine and metabolic disorders that affects up to 10% women of childbearing age [1]. It shows a broad range of reproduction abnormality, including menstrual disorders, infertility and hyperandrogenism. Beyond hormonal derangements, obesity especially abdominal adipose accumulation, insulin resistance (IR), compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and a low-grade chronic inflammation often coexist with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which increase the risk for the development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in the future [2].  In recent years, dietary interventions in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have become popular in both reproductive and endocrine researches.",ce89c2a5-03de-4885-8d72-032ebbad9b93
1,background1," Since up to 60% of women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are overweight or obese [3], the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) also emphasizes the importance of diet in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and recommends dietary and exercise interventions as the first-line management in this population [4]. To date, several dietary strategies have been proposed for the treatment of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), such as the low glycemic index diet, dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet, the Mediterranean diet, low carbohydrate diet, pulse-based diet, ketogenic diet, low-starch/low-dairy diet, and vegetarian diet [5–12]. Typically, intermittent fasting (IF) is the practice of alternate eating and fasting. IF is an umbrella term for three different types of diets: alternate-day fasting, the 5:2 diet, and time-restricted feeding (Time restricted feeding (TRF)) generally defined as fasting for 12–20 h [13].",fed1f1d3-e2b7-43b9-b6be-a4efd682d0a5
2,background2," Time restricted feeding (TRF) allows to ad libitum feeding within a large window of time each day without any calorie counting. Emerging evidence has suggested that Time restricted feeding (TRF) was beneficial for losing body weight, ameliorating IR, regulating metabolism, and improving cardiometabolic health [14, 15]. To the best of our knowledge, except for a very limited report on dawn-to-sunset Ramadan fasting in which Muslims abstain from eating and drinking [16], there has been no persuasive study on the possible role of IF in the Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) population.  Since therapeutic options for Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are limited to oral contraceptives and metformin, and non-pharmacologic behavioral interventions such as Time restricted feeding (TRF) would be welcome additions to therapy for this common disorder.",3c16dbbd-8f74-4a6c-882a-efa385f9c8cd
3,background3," Thus a 6-week trial, with 2 consecutive periods: (1) 1-week baseline weight stabilization period; and (2) 5-week Time restricted feeding (TRF) period, was implemented to explore the effects of Time restricted feeding (TRF) on menstruation, gonadal and metabolic parameters in women with anovulatory Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and propose a basis for its inclusion in the treatment of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). ",2aafaadf-fc09-480c-bd51-fded4a652948
4,methods0," Eighteen Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women aged between 18 and 31 with anovulation participated in a 6-week trial which were divided into two consecutive periods: (1) 1-week baseline weight stabilization period and (2) 5-week Time restricted feeding (TRF) period. Fifteen participants completed the study. Changes in body weight, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), Waist-to-Hip Ratio, skeletal muscle mass, body fat mass (body fat mass (BFM)), body fat percentage (BF%), visceral fat area (visceral fat area (VFA)), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)), LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone (TT), sex hormone-binding globulin (sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)), free androgen index (free androgen index (FAI)), fasting glucose, fasting insulin (fasting insulin (FINS)), homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),",f2a56097-732b-4946-8ec9-25d45c22b391

Participants  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) outpatients were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University in 2020 and data collection was completed in January 2021. The inclusion criteria were: age 18–40 years; body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) ≥ 24 kg/m2; anovulation; and a diagnosis of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) based on the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria [17].",8bbf22de-8aa2-40ca-bc72-48efbab482ad
6,methods2," The exclusion criteria were: use of medication therapy that impacts carbohydrate or lipid metabolism (oral contraceptive pills, insulin-sensitizers, anti-epileptics, anti-psychotics, statins, and fish oil) in the recent 6 months; body weight fluctuations for more than 5% in the past 3 months; in preparation for pregnancy, pregnant or lactating; perimenopausal; night-shift workers; fasting for more than 16 h per day; hypotension; patients with other diseases (such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome, androgen-secreting tumors, hyperprolactinemia, diabetes, thyroid diseases, severe serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, kidney and liver diseases); alcohol intake for more than 100 g per week; smoking within the past 3 months and engaging in high-intensity exercise.

7,methods3," The study followed a pre-post non-randomized design and it was pre-registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04580433). The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) checklist for prospective cohort studies [18] was used to guide the report of this study (Additional file 1). The trial consisted of a 1-week baseline weight stabilization period followed by a 5-week Time restricted feeding (TRF) intervention period. After signing the informed consent, the following data were obtained to determine eligibility: (1) Height, weight, and age, (2) Blood pressure, (3) Menstrual cycle and (4) Medical history. The eligible participants were then invited to attend a baseline assessment visit where they completed the following assessments: (1) Body composition analysis and (2) Three Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 21 Item (TFEQ-R21) questionnaire [19].",6622128c-23d3-49a5-882e-8f7335b67ce6
8,methods4," They also underwent a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and blood samples for measurement of plasma glucose and insulin were drawn prior at 0, 60 and 120 min after glucose ingestion. During the baseline (week 0–1), participants were asked to measure their body weight every morning when fasting, continue with their usual diets, exercise, and sleep habits to keep their weight stable (no body weight fluctuations greater than 0.5 kg within a week). During the Time restricted feeding (TRF) period (week 2–6), they were asked not to change the composition of their usual diets but were instructed to eat freely from 8 am to 4 pm daily and to fast from 4 pm to 8 am the next day. Participants were provided with a food diary and were instructed to record their daily food intake from start to finish using the Boohee software, a diet and fitness app in China to calculate the corresponding calories.",c97dfa19-b5d1-43e0-9a09-17399e1bf397
9,methods5," Daily dietary calorie intake was required to be approximately consistent with the baseline for as much as possible (fluctuations for no more than 10%) to address potential sources of bias. During the 16-h fasting, only water or calorie-free beverages were allowed, and participants were encouraged to drink enough water throughout the intervention period. We contacted participants via phone at the end of each week to review the protocol, monitor adverse events, provide support and guidance to promote compliance with interventions. All the baseline assessments were repeated at the follow-up visit on the 6th week when the diaries and data of time return to normal menstrual cycle were collected. All the examinations were conducted in the morning when the participants were fasting.  Anthropometric measurements  For each participant, body weight and height were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI) [weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2), kg/m2].",69ca88d7-5fbf-4667-b9dd-366693b5560c
10,methods6," Height was measured to the nearest 1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca 711; Hamburg, Germany). Body weight was determined to the nearest 0.1 kg using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer InBody 770 scanner (In-body Bldg, Seoul, Korea), with high resolution touch screen, frequency of 1,5, 50, 260, 500, 1000 kHz and measurement time of 60 s, with the subjects in a standing position with shoes, coats and sweaters removed, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Waist-to-Hip Ratio (Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR)) was measured by InBody 770 scanner, waist circumstance and hip circumstance were measured by the same nurse. The Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) was calculated using these measurements.  Body composition  Body composition such as skeletal muscle mass (skeletal muscle mass (SMM)) (kg), body fat mass (body fat mass (BFM)) (kg), body fat percentage (BF%) and visceral fat area (visceral fat area (VFA)) (cm2) were evaluated by InBody 770 scanner.",a45e7674-79f2-4abf-ba4d-e4408e90360f
11,methods7,"  Blood sampling and analysis  The participants’ fasting blood samples were collected before and after the intervention. Blood samples were taken from antecubital vein and collected into the BD Vacutainers Tubes (SSTTM II Advance, REF 367953). Then, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3600 rpm at 4 °C. The obtained serum and plasma were aliquoted and stored at – 80 °C before analysis. Insulin 0 min, 60 min, 120 min (μU/mL) were measured by radioimmunological assay, luteinizing hormone (LH) (mIU/mL) and follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)) (mIU/mL) were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay, total testosterone (TT) (ng/mL) was measured by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (ng/mL) and sex hormone-binding globulin (sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) (nmol/L) were measured by immunochemiluminescent on Beckman Coulter Unicel Dxl 800.",52703355-9fc1-4126-a33f-9dbd8bcc5f68

Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated according to the formula “fasting insulin (FINS) (μU/mL) × FG (mmol/L)/22.5”. Free androgen index (free androgen index (FAI)) (%) was calculated according to the formula “TT (ng/mL) × 100/sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (nmol/L)”.",1cbdd983-5b39-4d6a-b809-912c288dd4a7
13,methods9,"  Questionnaires  The TFEQ-R21 were completed during pre- and post- visits. The TFEQ-R21 covers 3 eating behavior domains: the cognitive restraint scale (6 items) assesses control over food intake to influence body weight and body shape; the emotional eating scale (6 items) measures the propensity to overeating in relation to negative mood states; the uncontrolled eating scale (9 items) assesses the tendency to lose control of overeating when feeling hungry or when exposed to external stimuli. It contains 20 questions based on a 4-point Likert-Scale (1 = definitely false, 2 = mostly false, 3 = mostly true, 4 = definitely true) and each question scored between 1 and 8 on eating restraint (1 = no restraint when eating, 8 = extreme restraint when eating). Higher scores indicate greater cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, or emotional eating. ",686e98d3-7b8a-406d-9671-2b787855a5e5

Only fifteen participants completed the 6-week of follow-up with three dropouts could not be contacted at the end of the first week. Thus fifteen subjects were concluded in the study with 31 variables of interests (Fig. 1). Participants were between 18 and 31 years old with anovulation (the menstrual cycle was delayed by 3 months–3 years) and normotensive but mainly insulin resistant (patients at the beginning of the study had a HOMA-IR higher than 2.3).

16,results1," Three participants caught a cold during the follow-up and the values of hsCRP of them were excluded, but by the time of the blood collection, the treatments were already completed, and the participants were free of symptoms. One participant was not in fasting state at the follow-up, so we did not test her blood for glucose and insulin analysis. Feeling hungry every day was reported by two participants (2/15, 13.3%), several days per week by three participants (3/15, 20.0%), once a week or less by ten participants (7/15, 46.7%), and never by three participants (3/15, 20.0%). They did not have any discomfort, except for one participant complained that she had irregular defecation in the first week of Time restricted feeding (TRF). Besides, Time restricted feeding (TRF) did not influence their sleep. Seven participants (7/15, 46.7%) found it easy or very easy to adhere to Time restricted feeding (TRF) rules, six participants (6/15, 40.",faa28b93-3f4c-427e-8e0d-863f89b2b9c2

21,discussion0," This is the first study to investigate the implications of Time restricted feeding (TRF) in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with chronic anovulation on anthropometric indexes, body composition, endocrine and metabolic profiles. Five weeks of Time restricted feeding (TRF) improved menstruation, gonadal profiles (TT, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI)), body weight, body mass index (BMI), body composition profiles (body fat mass (BFM), BF% and visceral fat area (VFA)), hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance profiles (fasting insulin (FINS), HOMA-IR, area under the curve (AUC)Ins and area under the curve (AUC)Ins/area under the curve (AUC)Glu), decreasing aminotransferase (ALT), hsCRP and increasing IGF-1 in a group of fifteen young women with anovulatory Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Hyperandrogenemia is one of the main features of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which often leads to irregular menstruation.",5d47c06f-ad1f-42c7-b22c-2bd28915f9a4
22,discussion1," In the present study, all the patients were anovulatory women with diagnosed or previously diagnosed hyperandrogenemia. After Time restricted feeding (TRF), more than half of the patients restored their normal menstrual cycles. Hence, it is promising that Time restricted feeding (TRF) may ameliorate hyperandrogenemia by increasing sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels and exert beneficial effects on the recovery of the normal menstrual cycle in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. Abnormal LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio is common in women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A prior study had shown that Time restricted feeding (TRF) had a negative effect on LH pulsation during ovarian development in prepubertal girls [20], whereas we did not find any significant difference in LH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Paoli et al.",6778b243-733c-4547-9739-edbede7a3b74
23,discussion2," [12] investigated the effect of a ketogenic diet on Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients and observed significant decreases in TT, free testosterone, LH/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio and LH, with a significant reduction of body weight (− 9.43 kg) after twelve weeks treatment. However, whether the benefits were from weight loss or from the specific dietary approach still needed to be investigated. Furthermore, the duration of our study was short (5 weeks) which might limit the possible changes in LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.  Obesity is closely related to Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with a greater prevalence of menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenemia and hirsutism [21]. Accumulating evidence shows that Time restricted feeding (TRF) may produce a small but statistically significant 1–4% of weight loss [22].",501ab14d-6073-4b3e-a356-9aa4800e1e9d
24,discussion3," Previous meta-analyzes have also shown that Time restricted feeding (TRF) was more likely to control weight and improve body composition [13, 23]. For active females, resistant training combined with Time restricted feeding (TRF) may result in a greater loss of fat mass than resistant training with a usual diet, and Time restricted feeding (TRF) group also reported a 18% decrease in visceral fat mass [24]. In our study, participants who maintained dietary intake of past habits with a low intensity of exercise also reduced their body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat mass (BFM), BF% and visceral fat area (VFA) significantly in the Time restricted feeding (TRF) period, while Time restricted feeding (TRF) for 5 weeks did not decrease Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) or change lean mass significantly.  Elevated blood glucose concentration is a pivotal factor in the diagnosis of metabolic diseases.",782c0588-8444-4f67-8b0b-d4b4c71244d4
25,discussion4," Consistently high concentration of glucose can damage blood vessels and lead to an increased heart disease risk and insulin resistance [22]. While previous findings on the role of Time restricted feeding (TRF) in fasting glucose were equivocal, most of these trials reported no change in fasting glucose [22], it is worth noting that although Martens et al. [24] reported no change in fasting glucose, they did find a significant decrease in area under the curve (AUC)Glu during the 8 h Time restricted feeding (TRF). A five-day Time restricted feeding (TRF) (10 am–5 pm) reduced night-time glucose level in participants who were overweight [25]. A 4-day Time restricted feeding (TRF) (8 am–2 pm) also lowered the mean glucose level at night-time but did not lower glucose level during the awake period. In summarizing the results of the entire day, Time restricted feeding (TRF) reduced mean 24 h glucose levels by 4 ± 1 mg/dL [26].",422bb01b-700a-4e68-bd3d-49c86155c796
26,discussion5," In our study, blood tests were all conducted in the morning and we did not detect significant differences in FG and area under the curve (AUC)Glu. A review reported that isocaloric Time restricted feeding (TRF) seemed to be more beneficial in reducing fasting insulin (FINS) and IR when compared to ad libitum Time restricted feeding (TRF) [22]. Isocaloric Time restricted feeding (TRF) may improve fasting insulin levels independently of weight loss, especially in those who are prediabetes [27]. Our ad libitum study observed significant reductions in fasting insulin (FINS), HOMA-IR, area under the curve (AUC)Ins and area under the curve (AUC)Ins/area under the curve (AUC)Glu in a short time Time restricted feeding (TRF) (8 am–4 pm) which suggested that Time restricted feeding (TRF) without limiting energy may also ameliorate hyperinsulinemia and improve IR.  Dyslipidemia is present in 70% of patients with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), regardless of body mass index (BMI) [28].",d62a1eaa-683a-4dd6-baa0-b63a3ce38a4f
27,discussion6," The roles of Time restricted feeding (TRF) in plasma lipid levels were not consistent. No significant differences were found in TC, TG and LDL-C levels in the present study.  Polycystic ovaries show persistent chronic inflammation with a larger number of infiltrating inflammatory cells. These cells induce insulin resistance, stimulate androgen production and disrupt the function of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. A meta-analysis showed that CRP level was higher in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients than in healthy women, independent of obesity [29]. We found that short time Time restricted feeding (TRF) may reduce hsCRP and thus improve the state of chronic inflammation in overweight Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. IGF-1 plays an important role in glucose metabolism [30]. Low circulating levels of IGF-1 in healthy adults are associated with reduced β-cells function [31]. The increased level of IGF-1 after the reduction diet had a cardioprotective effect [32].",68f47075-f42b-4081-a53e-a54ad2ab30d1
28,discussion7," We also found a higher IGF-1 in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients after Time restricted feeding (TRF), which was contrary to the results of a 5-day Time restricted feeding (TRF) in overweight humans [26]. While it is still difficult to clarify the effect of IGF-1 in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), since IGF-1 has linked with the disturbed follicular development in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [33]; a higher IGF-1 in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women may be related to the increased vascularity that underlies the increased blood flow [34]. Abnormal serum aminotransferase (ALT) is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity in young women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a manner that is independent from the contribution of age and total adiposity [35]. Our study found Time restricted feeding (TRF) may decrease aminotransferase (ALT) levels in Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  There were several limitations in the current study.",90c471fa-bfd1-42bc-95c3-299bb52ad0fc
29,discussion8," Firstly, this was a non-randomized intervention without a control group with a small number of participants which limited our ability to detect a significant difference. Secondly, our study was of a short duration (5 weeks) which limited the physiological changes that could be induced. Because of the strict inclusion criteria, the variability of the cohort may have limited the generalizability of the results to a broader cohort of patients with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Thirdly, the intervention was conducted in a free-living population, and participants failed to receive standardized diets. Although the participants were asked to record calories to retain their energy intake from food, the estimated value is for reference only. Fourthly, adherence to the 8 h Time restricted feeding (TRF) may have been affected by various factors since participants may be more likely to adhere if they feel in control.",299ed843-e974-4d42-b1d1-a7c6a40d89a6
30,discussion9," Thus, well-designed studies are needed to examine the safety, applicability, and usefulness of Time restricted feeding (TRF) for Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients.  Conclusions  Eight-hour Time restricted feeding (TRF) may have beneficial effects on improving menstruation, hyperandrogenemia and reducing weight especially body fat, decreasing insulin resistance and chronic inflammation in women with anovulatory Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
