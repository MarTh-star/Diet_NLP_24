IRE led to JNK phosphorylation in the old rats, whereas BHB-treated old rats showed attenuated protein level of ER stress markers including protein kinase RNA like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). To verify the preventive effects of BHB on lipid accumulation, the hepatic TG content was examined. Fig. 3A shows the results of the hepatic TG content.

Moreover, CR and BHB-treated old rats showed comparatively higher expression of β-oxidation-related genes (PPARα, CPT-1α, and ACOX1) than that in the old rats (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that BHB and CR improve hepatic lipid accumulation through down-regulation of lipogenic genes and up-regulation of β-oxidation genes. These results were confirmed by Oil red O staining of the liver tissues. We further detected an overall increase in the number of vacuoles in the liver tubules during the aging process. The CR or BHB-treated groups were found to suppress lipid accumulation (Fig. 3D).

On the other hand, BHB reduced the levels of ER stress-related proteins. Further to determine whether BHB inhibits lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, the level of cellular TG was measured. BHB-treated groups reduced cellular TG level as compared to that in the palmitate-treated group (Fig. 5A). Similarly, lipid accumulation was examined by Oil red O staining.

BHB can reduce the intracellular cAMP concentration by activating the Gαi subunit of G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A [16].

It was observed that the induction of AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation by BHB was associated with a concomitant reduction in AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). These results suggested that BHB reduced cAMP level leading to a subsequent reduction in PKA phosphorylation and AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation. Thus, BHB inhibited PKA phosphorylation by reducing the cAMP level in the BHB-treated old rats.   Figure 6.

22,results9," These results demonstrated that BHB decreased cAMP and cAMP-dependent PKA phosphorylation leading to regulatory AMPK phosphorylation, in which decreased AMPK-Ser173 and increased AMPK-Thr172. Thus, BHB inhibited PKA phosphorylation by reducing the cAMP level in HepG2 cells. This confirmed a reduction in the intracellular cAMP level and a subsequent reduction in the PKA activity. Inhibition of PKA activity blocks AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation, thereby increasing AMPK-Thr172. These results suggest that BHB reduced intercellular cAMP level leading to the regulation of the G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A/AMPK pathway in HepG2 cells.   Figure 7.

As shown in Fig. 8A, BHB suppressed PKA and AMPK-Ser phosphorylation and reduced phosphorylated AMPK-Thr levels in the G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A-siRNA-treated HepG2 cells. However, BHB treatment reduced cAMP level. Otherwise, no change in cAMP level in G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A-siRNA was observed (Fig. 8B).

28,discussion0," Aging is one of the most critical risk factors for the onset and progression of age-related disease including obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Hepatic lipid accumulation is representative of the pathological phenomenon of age-related liver diseases, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cancer. Fatty liver disease is considered to be the consequence of metabolic diseases accompanied by increased serum Free fatty acid (FFA), TG, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, as well as decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) level. The lipotoxic environment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is due to a surplus of lipids that directly influence ER homeostasis and ER stress activation [24].  ER stress is known as unfolded protein response (UPR), which is triggered by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. This response is important for the restoration of normal ER function.",fa465db8-423f-4a3b-9365-eec64dcbe557
29,discussion1," Prolonged ER stress causes cell death, prevents translation of synthesized protein, and increases the production of ER chaperones, such as glucose-regulated protein (glucose regulated protein (GRP)) 78 and 94. ER stress is also considered as the critical component in the development of insulin resistance and lipid accumulation. Three protein are well known to sense ER stress and activate unfolded protein response (UPR): protein kinase RNA like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), IRE-1, and ATF6 [25]. Recently, it has been reported that lipid accumulation and ER stress were ameliorated by CR and intermittent fasting dietary intervention as indicated by a decrease in the hepatic TG level under these conditions [26, 27].  The above studies provide evidence suggesting that BHB could be used as a potential CR mimetic, which has beneficial anti-lipogenic effects in the liver as demonstrated in vivo and in vitro.",88faeb86-70b2-4c47-b26c-7bac5413ece1
30,discussion2," CR prolongs the life span and is known to modulate the onset and progression of age-related diseases in the non-vertebrates and rodents. The beneficial effects of CR have been well-established through experiments and there is accumulating evidence on its anti-aging effects. Previous studies have shown that CR suppresses systemic inflammation and may modulate fatty liver disease [27, 28]. Moreover, CR changes hepatic lipid droplet proteome and diacylglycerol species and also prevents diabetes in mice [26]. BHB is a metabolic product that is released into the blood circulation mostly from the liver and is utilized in the extrahepatic tissues in the fasting state. In humans, basal serum levels of BHB are normally maintained in a low micromolar concentration range, but the level begins to rise to a few hundred micromoles after 12-16 h of fasting, reaching 1-2 mM after 2 days of fasting [29]. Furthermore, a prolonged CR condition leads to an increased BHB level in rats [30].",9a9fdef2-140b-4fee-9ed7-4835a80ddf1b
31,discussion3,"  Consistent with the results of previous studies, serum BHB level was notably increased in the present study in rats conditioned by CR similar to that of rats administered BHB at a high dose. The serum levels of TG and Free fatty acid (FFA) were diminished in both CR and BHB-treated aged rats (Fig. 1). A possibility is that BHB exerts inhibitory effects on hepatic lipid accumulation. Based on the hepatic TG contents analysis, BHB administration in a high dose showed reduced hepatic TG levels and increased expression of CPT-1, a key regulatory enzyme of β-oxidation, thus, up-regulating β-oxidation genes, such as ACOX1 (Fig. 3C). In line with such speculation, the aging process was found to increase hepatic lipid accumulation, whereas this phenomenon was compromised in the BHB-treated old rats (Fig. 3).  It has been reported that an adequate concentration of BHB during starvation could reach to bind and activate G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A as its receptor.",af94f515-268a-45fd-a25d-9d8e4ee08fab
32,discussion4," G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A activation through BHB inhibits adipocyte lipolysis [14, 31]. Therefore, it has been suggested that BHB acts as a metabolite and aids in survival during starvation. It regulates self-production, prevents ketoacidosis, and regulates lipid utilization. In G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A knockout mice, increased body weight, hepatic steatosis, and serum biomarkers of liver injury were observed [15]. The present study focused on the regulatory mechanism of BHB signaling through G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A. G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A interacts and couples to a Gαi subunit protein and inhibits AC activity.  G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A is known to signal and inhibits PKA activity [32]. PKA activation leads to AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation of the inactive form, as well as inhibition of AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation. Thus, this observation supports that BHB acts as a ligand of G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A in the liver.",57f8bd7d-04f4-4a58-872a-1f8cc6ba92c4
33,discussion5," A central feature in the proposed model involves PKA-dependent AMPK-Ser173 to inhibit AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation. In regard to this reciprocal mechanism, AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation was found to inhibit AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation by PKA [17]. In line with this report, increased AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation reciprocally reduced AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation leading to the down-regulation of AMPK activity [18]. AMPK activation via AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation prevented ER stress response and hepatic lipid accumulation [19]. Inhibition of lipid accumulation is mediated by BHB-dependent AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation that occurs when AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation is suppressed. Therefore, these data suggest that G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A signaling regulates the reciprocal activation mechanism between AMPK-Thr172 and AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation that contributes to the abilities of BHB to improve hepatic lipid accumulation (Fig. 7).",118e052c-6900-433f-a449-b7bccb8dfa92
34,discussion6,"  AMPK has been shown to play a critical role in controlling the systemic energy balance and metabolism [33]. Furthermore, AMPK may be a physiological regulator that maintains ER homeostasis [34] and protects against hepatic steatosis when mice are fed on a high-fructose diet [35]. However, this study has certain limitations as we primarily explored the acute effect of BHB. We administered BHB only for 30 days, which is considered a rather short induction period, and the treatment period could have been prolonged further to define the molecular mechanisms representing the anti-lipid accumulation effect in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we explored the beneficial effects of BHB on liver steatosis, suggesting that BHB supplementation may lead to the restoration of liver functions in the aging process. BHB regulates the activation of G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A and leads to a reduction in cAMP level in the liver, resulting in the inhibition of PKA phosphorylation.",98c5fede-5f12-4c63-a74a-13185991874b
35,discussion7," PKA inhibition inhibits AMPK phosphorylation at the Ser173 site, which is an inactive form and stimulates AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation. Therefore, BHB-mediated AMPK activation attenuates ER stress and lipid accumulation in the aged liver (Fig. 7C). Our results provide significant insights into the cellular and molecular basis of G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A/PKA/AMPK, thereby proposing this novel candidate target for the treatment of altered lipogenesis.  In summary, BHB administration could improve age-related ER stress and lipid accumulation through stimulation of the G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A pathway. This mechanism provides a unifying model to account for the therapeutic effects of BHB through the G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A/AMPK signaling. We conclude that BHB suppresses aging-related ER stress and lipid accumulation as a CRmimetic via G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A/ AMPK in aged liver.",fe8b4c5b-5955-484c-8cc5-b2ba87d9ee3f
36,discussion8," Therefore, activation of AMPK by BHB through the G protein coupled receptor (GPR)109A pathway in the liver has the potential to improve deranged metabolic functions in fatty liver. ",20f8a800-747c-4eef-a750-8fefe3b164b8
