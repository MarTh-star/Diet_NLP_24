1,methods1," There were no restrictions on intervention length or follow-up measurement points. The exclusion criteria were as follows: non-human studies, the use of an additional intervention other than any kind of intermittent fasting, such as lifestyle changes or physical activity. The PICOS criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies are shown in Table 1.  2.6. Search Strategy and Study Selection  We reviewed available publications using the databases PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, using the words “non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)”, “Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD)”, “metabolic-associated fatty liver disease” or “non-alcoholic fatty liver disease”, and “intermittent fasting”, “Ramadan” or “time-restricted eating”. We limited the results to papers in English (Figure 1). Flow diagrams for each database are available in Supplementary Materials.  3. Results  3.1.",5dafc90d-2234-4223-86df-44b255a41fc3
2,methods2," Study Selection  Eight studies that used intermittent fasting in patients with Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) were included in this review. In the majority of the papers studied, the fasting regimen reported was Ramadan. Other regimens reported were Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF) (Alternate-Day Modified Fasting), time restricted feeding (TRF) (time-restricted fasting) and modified fasting regimens (MFR) (modified fasting regimen).  3.2. Participant Characteristics  In two studies, the mean age of patients ranged from 33.6–37.6 years [18,19]. In another four studies, it averaged 40.5–46.0 years [20,21,22,23] and in two studies the age range was 51.8–57.0 years [24,25]. The mean BMI of study participants ranged from 29.5–36.7 kg/m2. Information on the study groups is provided in Table 2.  3.3. Fasting Strategy and Duration  Five studies used Ramadan as an intervention, which lasted 4 weeks [19,20,21,22,25].",87c3c23d-7b73-4753-b113-62547ecb433c
3,methods3," One study (in one group) used time restricted feeding (TRF) lasting 12 weeks [18]. Two studies used Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF): Cai et al. (in the second group) lasting 12 weeks [18] and Johari et al. lasting 8 weeks [23]. Additionally, Holmer et al. used modified fasting regimens (MFR) for 12 weeks [24]. Detailed information on the included studies can be found in Table 3.  3.4. Time-Restricted Fasting (time restricted feeding (TRF))  Time-restricted fasting was used in six studies [18,19,20,21,22,25]. Five of them used Ramadan as a form of intermittent fasting [19,20,21,22,25] which lasted about 4 weeks. The study by Cai et al. [18] lasted 12 weeks, but patients were also followed up after 4 weeks of time restricted feeding (TRF).  Body weight was controlled in three studies [18,19,20]. Arabi et al. in their two studies [21,22] and Mari et al. [25] reported only the BMI value. Aliasghari et al.",0144274f-ccc5-4b63-bc5c-dc66bedbf702

Cai et al. [18] also observed a statistically significant decrease in body weight compared to the control group after both 4 weeks (75.0 ± 8.0 kg vs. 71.3 ± 7.0 kg, p < 0.001) and 12 weeks (75.0 ± 8.0 kg vs. 71.7 ± 7.4 kg, p < 0.001). Rahimi et al. [20] reported no statistically significant change in body weight in the study group compared to the control group. Arabi et al., in both studies, [21,22] reported no statistically significant change in BMI values, in contrast to Mari et al. [25], who reported a statistically significant decrease (36.7 ± 7.1 kg/m2 vs. 34.5 ± 6.8 kg/m2, p < 0.005).  Waist circumference was monitored in three studies [18,19,22]. Only Aliasghari et al.

[18] also reported no statistically significant changes in lean mass.  Arabi et al. [22] monitored systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) levels in their study. They noted significant differences only in the male group. systolic blood pressure (SBP) at baseline was 130 mmHg, and after intervention it was 120 mmHg (p < 0.001). diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased from 70.50 mmHg at baseline to 70.00 mmHg (p = 0.003). In women, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was at baseline and after intervention 120 mmHg, while diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased from an initial 78 mmHg to 80 mmHg (p = 0.75).",02ccd73d-0b65-49ea-9281-9b151175b46e
6,methods7,"  Alanine Transferase (ALT) levels were determined by Rahimi et al. [20], Arabi et al. [22] and Mari et al. [25]. Statistically significant differences were noted in all studies. In the first study, there was an increase in Alanine Transferase (ALT) level (34.6 ± 13.5 IU/L vs. 42.0 ± 17.8 IU/L; change = 7.4 ± 8.5 IU/L—statistically significant compared to the change in the control group; p = 0.002), while decreases were observed in the second and third studies. Arabi et al.: in men (18 IU/L vs. 13 IU/L, p < 0.001), in women (13 IU/L vs. 11 IU/L, p = 0.001) [22]; Mari et al.: 44.2 ± 12.8 IU/L vs. 34.2 ± 9.4 IU/L, p < 0.005 [25]. Arabi et al. [22] also measured AST levels but did not find a statistically significant change in either group, whereas Mari et al. found a statistically significant decrease (51.4 ± 9.4 IU/L vs. 39.2 ± 8.2 IU/L, p < 0.005) [25].  Fasting blood glucose levels were monitored in three studies [18,19,22]. Cai et al.",a3a63e22-3409-4493-a50d-fdf6f07a459d
7,methods9," [18] and Arabi et al. [22] measured triglyceride levels. Both studies reported differences after the intervention, but Cai et al. reported a statistically significant decrease compared to the control group at both 4 and 12 weeks (baseline: 2.9 ± 1.8 mmol/L; after 4 weeks: 2.3 ± 1.8 mmol/L, p < 0.001; after 12 weeks: 2.3 ± 1.8 mmol/L, p < 0.001) [18], while Arabi et al. reported an increase in triglyceride levels (138 mg/dL vs. 190 mg/dL, p < 0.001 in men and 197 mg/dL vs. 233 mg/dL, p = 0.23 in women) [22].  Total cholesterol levels were again only measured by Cai et al. [18] and Arabi et al. [22]. The first study reported no statistically significant change compared to the control group [18], whereas Arabi et al. observed statistically significant increases in levels in both men and women (190.6 ± 47.4 mg/dL vs. 220.7 ± 60.0 mg/dL, p = 0.001 and 200.0 ± 45.5 mg/dL vs. 229.1 ± 47.9 mg/dL, p = 0.001, respectively) [22].  LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations were only measured by Cai et al.",58173764-d5d7-42f6-b349-275686f042d9
8,methods11," also reported a statistically significant decrease in hs-CRP level (14.2 ± 7.1 mg % vs. 7.2 ± 6.5 mg %, p < 0.005) [25].  Arabi et al. in their second study [21] measured the levels of palmitic acid, oleic acid and elaidic acid. The intervention reported only one significant statistical change: an increase in elaidic acid levels among women (24.8 ± 2.1 ppm vs. 35.9 ± 9.8 ppm, p = 0.001).  3.5. Alternate-Day Modified Fasting (Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF))  Two trials used alternate-day modified fasting (Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)) as an intervention [18,23]. Cai et al. [18] conducted a trial lasting 12 weeks with a checkpoint after 4 weeks. In contrast, the trial by Johari et al. lasted 8 weeks [23].  Both Johari et al. [23] and Cai et al. [18] reported statistically significant decreases (Cai et al. versus control group) in body weight. Johari et al. reported an initial mean body weight in the study group of 80.8 kg, while after 8 weeks it was 78.8 kg (p = 0.",489d524a-c644-40bc-8048-e3cf987c0f26

For BMI, only Johari et al. [23] obtained a statistically significant change (31.7 vs. 31.0, p = 0.003). Cai et al. [18] also measured waist circumference, lean mass and fat mass. For waist circumference and lean mass, they obtained no statistically significant change compared to the control group, but they recorded a statistically significant decrease in fat mass compared to the control group (Baseline: 30.6 ± 4.0 kg; after 4 weeks: 27.1 ± 2.5 kg, p < 0.001; after 12 weeks: 27.1 ± 2.5, p < 0.001).  Alanine Transferase (ALT) and AST levels were only measured by Johari et al. [23]. They obtained statistically significant decreases in both (Alanine Transferase (ALT): 84.3 IU/L vs. 59.2 IU/L, p = 0.001; AST: 51.4 IU/L vs. 42.8 IU/L, p = 0.004).  In contrast, fasting glucose levels were monitored in both studies [18,23].",6e99fd2c-7971-40d9-af3d-0935a13f77a6
10,methods13," Only Johari et al. [23] obtained a statistically significant change (6.6 mmol/L vs. 5.9 mmol/L, p = 0.006).  TG, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C were measured in both trials [18,23]. Only Cai et al. [18] reported statistically significant changes in TG in comparison with the control group (Baseline: 2.8 ± 1.9 mmol/L; after 4 weeks: 2.2 ± 1.9 mmol/L, p < 0.001; after 12 weeks: 2.1 ± 1.9 mmol/L, p < 0.001) and in TC (Baseline: 4.9 ± 1.0 mmol/L; after 4 weeks: 4.0 ± 1.1 mmol/L, p < 0.001; after 12 weeks: 4.2 ± 1.1 mmol/L, p < 0.001). Otherwise, no statistically significant changes were observed in either sample [18,23].  3.6. Modified Fasting Regimens (modified fasting regimens (MFR))  Modified fasting regimens were used in only one trial [24]. The intervention conducted by Holmer et al. used a 5:2 diet for 12 weeks.  The study authors observed statistically significant changes in anthropometric parameters (body weight: 96.9 ± 14.3 kg, change: −7.4 kg (95% CI: −8.7, −6.0), p < 0.001; BMI: 32.3 ± 2.",2a6c840c-8291-4d5d-8ce1-0e8eadf9cf1a

Discussion  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of the effect of various modifications of intermittent fasting on biochemical and anthropometric parameters in Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), focusing on dietary-only interventions.  The studies conducted so far determining the influence of nutrition on the development of Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and with the use of various nutritional modifications in the course of this disease indicate that diet is one of the key factors involved in both the development of the disease and its therapy [26,27,28,29]. Therefore, the appropriate composition of the diet is being sought and attempts are being made to determine the effect of individual dietary components in relation to Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).",0c29d14e-9be1-4b11-935a-d957242a1890
12,methods16," Previous studies have suggested a beneficial effect of consuming mono-unsaturated fatty acid (mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)) instead of saturated fatty acids. Another component with a positive effect is dietary fibre, as its low intake is associated with disease progression. For this reason, the consumption of whole grain products, among others, is recommended [30]. There is also no doubt that fructose intake leads to the development and progression of Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD); therefore, its daily intake should be controlled in both patients and healthy individuals for prophylactic purposes [27,31]. Patients with Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are also advised to regularly consume fruit and vegetables (with a predominance of vegetables), due to their content of vitamins, minerals, polyphenols and fibre [27,30,31].",4b7e6a09-7faa-46d1-ae18-410f443fced0
13,methods17," In addition to providing nutrients in adequate amounts, an adequate diet should also be balanced in terms of energy, as it should lead to weight reduction in Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) patients who are overweight or obese [27].  Intermittent fasting has so far been used in studies in the course of many diseases, e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, with measurable effects [15,16,17,32]. It should be noted that these are diseases that often coexist with Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) [33], making it reasonable to examine the use intermittent fasting among patients with Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).  Overweight or obesity is often observed among people with Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and diet should lead to effective weight reduction [24,33]. Aliasghari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [19] and Cai et al.",07eb67bd-c4dd-4719-a222-aea464cf34a1
14,methods18," (12 weeks of time restricted feeding (TRF) in one group and 12 weeks of Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF) in the other group) [18] reported statistically significant (Cai et al. versus control group) decreases in weight in subjects. Mari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) reported a statistically significant decrease in BMI. Rahimi et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [20] also observed a decrease in weight in patients, although not statistically significant. A meta-analysis including 35 studies that analysed the effect of Ramadan on weight loss in healthy adults found that there was a significant reduction in weight (−1.51 kg for men and −0.92 kg for women). However, this effect did not last longer than 2 weeks after the end of Ramadan, returning to the weight values before the start of this form of intermittent fasting. It was also pointed out that consistent lifestyle changes are necessary to maintain a consistent effect [34]. Cai et al. [18] and Johari et al.",9fa19fa9-5f07-4b8b-b95e-c273c8252c5f
15,methods19," [23], using alternate-day modified fasting (Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)) for 12 and 4 weeks, respectively, reported statistically significant weight decreases among patients in their trials. Cai et al. [18], although they did not obtain statistically significant changes in waist circumference and lean mass, reported statistically significant decreases in fat mass. Parvaresh et al. [35], in their study among individuals with metabolic syndrome, demonstrated that Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF) may be more effective in controlling body weight, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose, compared with common calorie restriction. In another study, by Razavi et al., also conducted in patients with metabolic syndrome, found that Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF) was more effective in reducing body weight, fat mass, waist circumference and waist:hip ratio compared with common calorie restriction [36]. A meta-analysis by Park et al.",8e36f622-3c01-4470-8802-e72679cec568
16,methods20," including studies using ADM or Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF) showed that this type of intermittent fasting was effective in reducing body weight, BMI and fat mass over 6 months in overweight individuals [37].  Inflammation has been shown to be involved in the development, course and progression of Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Therefore, an important element of the therapy is its reduction [12]. Razavi et al. also reported Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF) to be more effective in reducing hs-CRP levels [36]. Aliasghari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [19] and Mari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [25] also reported statistically significant decreases in hs-CRP levels in their study. In addition, Aliasghari et al. [19] reported statistically significant decreases in IL-6 levels. A study of 50 healthy individuals adhering to Ramadan also found that levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor α were lower during Ramadan [38].",145f3b09-5b44-4f22-9e3c-9ec162a9163a
17,methods21,"  A characteristic of Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the coexistence of other diseases for which proper nutrition may be helpful. One of them is hypertension [12]. Arabi et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [22] controlled for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in patients, noting a significant decrease only for systolic blood pressure (SBP) in men. Holmer et al. (modified fasting regimens (MFR)) [24] reported no statistically significant changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). However, a meta-analysis by Kord-Varkaneh et al. found that the use of fasting and energy restricting diets significantly reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), noting that interventions lasting ≤12 weeks were more effective [39]. In their meta-analysis, Moon et al. also noted that time restricted feeding (TRF) reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) [40].",6f7b65bf-f855-4d34-8a52-f4b45c00ee35
18,methods22,"  Alanine Transferase (ALT) and AST are considered to be among the most important markers of liver function. For this reason, the effectiveness of therapeutic management is often assessed by the effect on these two parameters. Among studies controlling for the effect of Ramadan on patients, some differences were observed for Alanine Transferase (ALT). Arabi et al. [22] and Mari et al. [25] reported statistically significant decreases, while Rahimi et al. [20] reported a statistically significant increase in Alanine Transferase (ALT) levels compared to the change in the control group. Johari et al. [23], using Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF) in their intervention, observed a statistically significant decrease in Alanine Transferase (ALT) levels. The same effect was obtained by Holmer et al. [24] studying the effect of modified fasting regimens (MFR). For AST, Arabi et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [22] observed no statistically significant change. This is in contrast to Mari et al.",a7b6be39-a865-4071-8449-ac00fc648314
19,methods23," (4 weeks of Ramadan) [25], who reported a statistically significant decrease in AST levels. Johari et al. (Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)) [23] also observed a statistically significant decrease in AST levels. A study by Holmer et al. (modified fasting regimens (MFR)) [24] found no statistically significant change in AST levels. A meta-analysis of 20 studies among healthy individuals doing Ramadan found that this form of intermittent fasting leads to significant but small positive changes in Alanine Transferase (ALT) and AST [41].  As mentioned earlier, other comorbidities are also observed in the course of Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Apart from obesity or hypertension, dysplimidaemia can also be observed among patients [12]. For TG, differences were observed between the studies of Cai et al. (time restricted feeding (TRF)) [18] and Arabi et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [22].",986c6502-3c77-4132-8f54-674a53c6fedf
20,methods24," The authors of the first study reported a statistically significant decrease in TG levels [18] while the second study reported an increase [22]. Cai et al. [18] also observed a statistically significant decrease in TG levels among patients using Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF). Johari et al. (Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)) [23] reported no statistically significant change. Holmer et al. (modified fasting regimens (MFR)) [24] also reported a statistically significant decrease in TG levels.  Cai et al. (time restricted feeding (TRF)) [18] reported no statistically significant change in TC levels, while Arabi et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) observed statistically significant increases in TC levels in women and men. Cai et al. [18], in their second group of patients (Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)), reported a statistically significant decrease in TC levels, which was not reported by Johari et al. [23]. Holmer et al.",b27adb83-50f9-4b06-bd42-3558e7087a9d
21,methods25," (modified fasting regimens (MFR)) [24] observed a statistically significant decrease in TC levels.  LDL-C and HDL-C was controlled by Cai et al. (time restricted feeding (TRF) and Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)) [18], Arabi et al. (4 weeks Ramadan) [22], Johari et al. (Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)) [23] and Holmer et al. (modified fasting regimens (MFR)) [24]. For studies using time restricted feeding (TRF), the only statistically significant change was reported by Arabi et al.: there was an increase in HDL-C levels in the female group [22]. No statistically significant changes in LDL-C and HDL-C levels were reported after Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF) [18,23]. Holmer et al. (modified fasting regimens (MFR)) [24] observed a statistically significant decrease in LDL-C.  A meta-analysis of studies that used Ramadan showed that it may cause moderate improvements in lipid and lipoprotein parameters, especially HDL-C levels.",5288ef98-9f20-48bd-94e4-1d0dcd0954d9
22,methods26," Furthermore, according to the authors, Ramadan appears to be more effective in male and athletic subjects [42]. In their meta-analysis of studies using alternate day fasting (ADF) or Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF), Park et al. also showed that these methods are effective in lowering TC levels within 6 months in overweight individuals [37]. A meta-analysis by Moon et al. showed that time restricted feeding (TRF) resulted in lower TG levels but had no effect on LDL-C and HDL-C [40].  An important factor, even considered as the basis of Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) pathogenesis, is insulin resistance. Therefore, one of the therapeutic goals should be to increase the insulin sensitivity of tissues and to aim for normal fasting glucose values [12]. Statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose levels were reported by Arabi et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [22] and Aliasghari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [19]. Cai et al.",81714b2b-c67a-4b81-a50c-45f085856b93
23,methods27," [18] in both groups (time restricted feeding (TRF) and Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)) reported no statistically significant changes. In contrast to Cai et al., Johari et al. (Alternate Day Modified Fasting (ADMF)) [23] obtained a statistically significant decrease in fasting blood glucose levels. Furthermore, Holmer et al. (modified fasting regimens (MFR)) [24] obtained a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c levels.  For insulin levels, Aliasghari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [19] reported a statistically significant increase, in contrast to Arabi et al. (4 weeks Ramadan) [22], who obtained a statistically significant decrease in the female group and Mari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [25], who also found a decrease.  Aliasghari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [19], Mari et al. (4 weeks of Ramadan) [25] and Holmer et al. (modified fasting regimens (MFR)) [24] also reported statistically significant decreases in HOMA-IR.  Moon et al.",fd8b8f32-d9bf-4391-92b5-3b5caacf0264
24,methods28," [40], in a meta-analysis, showed that time restricted feeding (TRF) has a positive effect on fasting blood glucose. A meta-analysis by Faris et al. [43] showed that Ramadan observance can positively affect glucose and insulin levels and HOMA-IR. A meta-analysis of studies among individuals without chronic metabolic disease also found that intermittent fasting significantly improves glycemic control and insulin resistance [44]. Another meta-analysis showed that intermittent fasting may improve glycemic control among obese individuals with type two diabetes. However, it was noted that this dietary strategy has similar effects to simple energy restriction and may not be effective in the long term [45].  Intermittent fasting is a quite specific diet, which due to its principles (e.g., long periods of fasting), may not suit all patients; therefore, the validity of its use should be confirmed by research.",1195ec49-2951-4e99-8d70-f064c30d695f
25,methods29," On the basis of the studies conducted so far on the effect of intermittent fasting in the course of metabolic diseases, it is difficult to unequivocally determine the effects of this dietary strategy. The results so far indicate that intermittent fasting may have positive effects, but this is not the rule. It is also uncertain whether intermittent fasting produces more positive results compared to other diets. At present, intermittent fasting cannot certainly be recommended as an effective method of improving a patient’s condition, regardless of the diseases represented by the patient, but this diet cannot be categorically rejected either.  5. Study Limitations  Our study has several strengths. First of all, the effects of specific types of intermittent fasting on biochemical and anthropometric parameters were analysed; intermittent fasting in general was not analysed. Only studies involving humans were included in the study.",c0d9e2a1-9307-452c-a216-019a95800576
26,methods30," All studies included in this review used only intermittent fasting as an intervention. A limitation of this review is the small number of studies overall and for specific types of intermittent fasting and the presence of differences between study groups (age, BMI).  6. Conclusions  Intermittent fasting appears to show some therapeutic potential among patients with Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, at the moment it is not possible to determine unequivocally the effect of this dietary strategy on biochemical and anthropometric parameters, as the results of studies conducted to date are inconsistent, and there is only a very small number of relevant published reports of randomised controlled trials. The effects of modifications of intermittent fasting should clearly be given separate consideration, and not simply lumped together under the overall heading of intermittent fasting.",60ba167f-3122-4944-84ae-177850dbe89c
27,methods31," Furthermore, it is not yet possible to determine the effect of intermittent fasting in the long term. Therefore, further studies on numerous groups of patients with longer-term use of the intervention are needed.
