0,methods0," Animals, diets, and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reperfusion model  All animal study protocols were approved by Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6-week-old, 220–240 g b.w, Hunan SJA laboratory animals, Changsha, China) were house in a temperature-controlled environment under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Rats were randomly divided into the ad libitum (AL, n = 8) and intermittent fasting (IF, n = 8) groups. AL rats were given with a free access to food and water. IF rats were fed 24 h every second day. This feeding schedule was applied for 3 months, and rats were then randomly divided into four groups (n = 8 per group): Sham AL; Sham IF; middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) AL and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) IF. For ER mimetics treatment, rats (n = 8 per group) were treated with either 2-DG (300 mg/kg), metformin (10 mg/kg) or resveratrol (2 mg/kg) by i.v. at 6 h before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery.",0bb8d29c-5dca-4b8b-a636-f040838cb7ce
1,methods1," The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery was performed as previously described [44]. Briefly, the left common carotid artery (common carotid artery (CCA)) of rat was exposed by a midline cervical incision after anesthesia. The external and internal carotid arteries were isolated, and a 3-0 nylon suture coated thread was inserted through internal carotid artery to occlude MCA. Rats were subjected to 2 h occlusion and 22 h reperfusion. For Sham groups, the same surgery was performed without the thread inserted. Rats will be excluded if they lose their appetite completely for 24 h or have poor appetite (less than 50% of the normal amount) for 3 days.  Infarct volume measurement  The brain was harvested, frozen immediately and cut into 2 mm coronal sections throughout the entire brain as previously described [45]. The sections were stained with 2% TTC solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min. The infarct volume was measured by Image J software (NIH).",48853d8c-18ed-4d2c-a4bc-3b6b09475603

Sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using Olympus confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Corp. Japan).  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (Enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA)) assay  The levels of IL-1β (BMS630), TNF-α (BMS622), and IL-6 (BMS625) in serum or cell culture supernatant were quantified using Enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA) kits (Invitrogen) [48]. Briefly, serum was prepared with a clotting for 30 min and a centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min. Cell culture supernatant was prepared with a centrifugation at 1400 rpm for 1 min. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader.",1db8f403-33fc-4d38-a6a6-63a2ed8ae155
4,methods5,"  Cell culture and OGD/R  Rat microglial cell line HAPI cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). HAPI cells were authenticated by STR profiling, and cells were tested without contamination with mycoplasma. Rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) were isolated and cultured as described [49]. The beaded microvessel fragment and individual endothelial cells were cultured in F12/DMEM containing 20% FBS (Gibco), 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.58 mg/ml L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For OGD/R treatment, HAPI cells or BMVECs were maintained in serum/glucose-free medium or glucose-free medium supplemented 2% FBS in a humidified incubator with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for 2 h, respectively. Thereafter, cells were then returned to normal medium with 5% CO2 in air for 24 h. The doses of ER mimetics were determined as previous described [50–52].",e1139804-9584-4c24-b7ed-8df5fcaccebb

11,results0," IF protects against cerebral ischemia-induced impairment and microglial activation whereas potentiated middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced angiogenesis  Rats were randomly divided into ad libitum (AL) and intermittent fasting (IF) groups. After 9 weeks, IF rats exhibited decreased body weight compared to AL rats (Fig. 1A). Both AL and IF rats were then assigned randomly to Sham and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) groups. The infarct area (white) was significantly increased in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and IF dramatically reduced the size of infarct area (Fig. 1B, C). The neurological deficit scores of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats were significantly higher than that of Sham rats, and the scores in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) IF group showed a remarkable reduction (Fig. 1D).",fee0e60d-ded3-47c0-b30b-65bb6d88e71e
12,results1," The rescue effects of IF on infarcted area and neurological deficit scores were also accompanied by a decrease in the mRNA levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in brain tissues compared to that of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) AL rats (Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained for the serum levels of these cytokines (Fig. 1F). It was well-established that microglial activation is rapidly observed after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and it also reflected the severity of ischemic damage [17]. As expected, the immunofluorescence of the microglial marker ionized calcium binding adapter molecule (IBA-1) was more intense in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) AL and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) IF groups, while little IBA-1 was detected in Sham groups. IF significantly attenuated middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced IBA-1 expression (Fig. 1G).",1f283723-cc79-491d-ad08-d2546f814dae
13,results2," By contrast, IF further potentiated middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-mediated increase of the well-known vascular marker CD31 (Fig. 1G). The expression of MAC2, a marker of activated microglia, exhibited similar trend as IBA-1 (Fig. 1G). Increased levels of H3K9ac, H3K56ac, thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, a CARD (ASC) and cleaved caspase-1 were found in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) AL and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) IF groups compared with control groups, whereas SIRT6 was significantly decreased in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. More importantly, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced changes of these proteins were partially abrogated by IF. No significant change of total H3 was observed (Fig. 1H).",e225cd34-52d7-4ab5-a38b-274cd13661d4
14,results3," Furthermore, the vascularization markers CD105, the key angiogenesis contributor vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and its downstream effector endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) were also examined. As presented in Fig. 1I, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-increased CD105, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and eNOS were potentiated by IF. These findings suggest that IF ameliorates middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced impairment and microglial activation and potentiates middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced angiogenesis by increasing SIRT6.Fig. 1 IF protects against cerebral ischemia-induced impairment, microglial activation, and potentiated middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced angiogenesis.

ER mimetics exert similar effects as IF in vivo  To verify the effects of IF in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats, rats were treated with three different ER mimetics including 2-DG, metformin or resveratrol at 6 h before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery.",471cc52f-4b12-4545-a072-17741835de06
16,results5," Significant infarct areas were observed in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats, whereas pre-treatment of ER mimetics markedly reduced infarct volume (Fig. 2A, B). The neurological scores were evaluated over a 7 days period. On day 1, 3, and 7, pre-treatment of ER mimetics consistently illustrated less impairment compared to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) alone group (Fig. 2C). Similarly, significant decrease of both mRNA and secretion levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were found in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats pre-treated with these ER mimetics (Fig. 2D, E). The effects of cerebral ischemia on IBA-1 and MAC2 expression were attenuated by three ER mimetics, while the CD31 positive vessels appeared much more abundant (Fig. 2F).",a1b16255-2b8b-499f-80ae-cedf4e58002d
17,results6," Consistently, ER mimetics abolished the effects of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), at least in part, on H3K9ac, H3K56ac, thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, a CARD (ASC), cleaved caspase-1 and SIRT6 expression (Fig. 2G). In addition, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-increased CD105, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and eNOS were potentiated by these ER mimetics (Fig. 2H).

ER mimetics protect against OGD/R-induced microglial activation in HAPI cells, and potentiate OGD/R-induced angiogenesis in BMVECs  We next evaluated the protective effects of ER mimetics in OGD/R cell model which was established to mimic the cerebral I/R in vitro. The cell viability of HAPI cells were increased by OGD/R, whereas 2-DG, metformin and resveratrol abrogated OGD/R-induced cell viability (Fig. 3A). In addition, Annexin-V/PI staining showed that OGD/R-inhibited apoptosis of HAPI cells were reversed by ER mimetics (Fig. 3B). Cytokines were released by activated microglia [18].",09c84776-3c54-49a6-b856-2cf029a4ad9b
19,results8," Consistent with the in vivo data, OGD/R resulted in a significant induction of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 on both secretion and mRNA levels, whereas pre-treatment of ER mimetics reduced OGD/R-mediated upregulation of these cytokines in HAPI cells (Fig. 3C, D). Western blotting revealed that OGD/R-induced upregulation of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, a CARD (ASC) and cleaved caspase-1, as well as downregulation of SIRT6, were partially rescued by ER mimetics (Fig. 3E). Additionally, OGD/R-increased cell apoptotic rate was attenuated by ER mimetics in BMVECs (Fig. 3F). OGD/R reduced cell viability, while BMVECs pre-treated with ER mimetics exhibited a markedly higher cell viability as detected by MTT assays (Fig. 3G). Moreover, BMVECs formed capillary-like structures were abundantly observed in OGD/R group, and pre-treatment of ER mimetics remarkably enhanced tube formation in BMVECs (Fig. 3H).",a5e13b31-3418-499d-b6bb-447c63084759
20,results9," Pre-treatment of ER mimetics potentiated OGD/R-mediated increase of CD105, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and eNOS, and OGD/R-mediated induction of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, a CARD (ASC), cleaved caspase-1, H3K9ac, and H3K56ac were attenuated by ER mimetics in BMVECs (Fig. 3I). The expression of SIRT6 was also downregulated by OGD/R in BMVECs, while ER mimetics counteracted the effect of OGD/R on SIRT6 expression (Fig. 3I). Collectively, these data indicate that ER mimetics protects against OGD/R-induced microglial activation in HAPI cells, and potentiates OGD/R-induced angiogenesis in BMVECs. SIRT6 and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) might be involved in the regulation of cerebral ischemia-induced microglial activation and angiogenesis.Fig. 3 ER mimetics protect against OGD/R-induced microglial activation in HAPI cells, and potentiate OGD/R-induced angiogenesis in BMVECs.",eebc4e38-3098-4325-902b-40c4d42e8ca8

22,results11,"  Overexpression of SIRT6 alleviates OGD/R-induced microglial activation in HAPI cells, and potentiates OGD/R-induced angiogenesis in BMVECs  To further delineate the role of SIRT6 during cerebral ischemia, SIRT6-overexpressing HAPI cells or BMVECs were subjected to OGD/R treatment. SIRT6 overexpression decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis of HAPI cells under both non-OGD/R and OGD/R conditions, compared with corresponding control (Fig. 4A, B). Overexpression of SIRT6 decreased OGD/R-mediated increase of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 secretion and expression in HAPI cells. Similar anti-inflammatory effect of SIRT6 was also observed under non-OGD/R condition (Fig. 4C, D). SIRT6 overexpression downregulated thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, a CARD (ASC) and cleaved caspase-1 expression under non-OGD/R condition, and it also reversed the effects of OGD/R on these protein levels in HAPI cells (Fig. 4E).",f6d2211e-c717-47c0-9abf-fd42ea333e40
23,results12," In BMVECs, SIRT6 overexpression promoted cell viability, and the adverse effects of OGD/R on cell viability were ameliorated by SIRT6 (Fig. 4F). SIRT6 overexpression exerted an opposite effect on cell apoptosis in BMVECs (Fig. 4G). Moreover, SIRT6 overexpression promoted tube formation, and OGD/R-induced tube formation was exacerbated by SIRT6 (Fig. 4H). In line with these findings, SIRT6 overexpression decreased thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, a CARD (ASC) and cleaved caspase-1 expression, but increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), eNOS and CD105 expression under non-OGD/R condition in BMVECs (Fig. 4I). Overexpression of SIRT6 also abolished OGD/R-mediated upregulation of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, a CARD (ASC) and cleaved caspase-1, and potentiated OGD/R-mediated increase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), eNOS and CD105 in BMVECs (Fig. 4I).",e7e2b43c-5ba4-426b-a767-d00011240cfb

SIRT6 suppresses thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) via deacetylation of H3K9ac and H3K56ac in HAPI cells and BMVECs  We next thought to unravel the underlying mechanism by which SIRT6 regulated thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). Gain- and loss of function experiments confirmed that SIRT6 overexpression led to a dramatic reduction of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), whereas loss of SIRT6 caused a remarkable induction of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) in both HAPI cells and BMVECs (Fig. 5A, B).",a98fd3af-be20-4839-9a33-717327d076dd
26,results15," Additionally, SIRT6 overexpression increased the thioredoxin reductase activity, while SIRT6 silencing inhibited the thioredoxin reductase activity in both HAPI cells and BMVECs (Fig. 5C). It is worth noting that silencing SIRT6 had no effect on SIRT1, SIRT3, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC6 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S1), supporting that shSIRT6 specifically knockdown SIRT6 in both HAPI cells and BMVECs. Additionally, H3K9ac and H3K56ac were significantly decreased in SIRT6-overexpressing HAPI cells and BMVECs compared to control cells (Fig. 5D). In contrast, lack of SIRT6 resulted in an increase on H3K9ac and H3K56ac levels. No significant changes in H3 protein levels were observed in these cells (Fig. 5D). Previous study has illustrated that SIRT6 is highly enriched at the transcriptional start site (transcriptional start site (TSS)) of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) to inhibit thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) transcriptionally in beta cells [12].",b783ba41-5ee4-4a63-9da5-e68425dcf47e
27,results16," Similarly, a significant enrichment of SIRT6 was found in the promoter region of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) in both HAPI cells and BMVECs as detected by ChIP assay (Fig. 5E). In addition, OGD/R decreased the enrichment of SIRT6 at thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) promoter, whereas ER mimetics partially reversed this effect in both HAPI cells and BMVECs (Fig. 5F). Moreover, we detected a significant decrease of H3K9ac and H3K56ac enrichments at thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) promoter in SIRT6-overexpressing HAPI cells and BMVECs. While H3K9ac and H3K56ac ChIP signals were markedly elevated in SIRT6-knockdown HAPI cells and BMVECs (Fig. 5G). No significant change was observed on the enrichment of total H3 at thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) promoter in these cells (Fig. 5G).",b1c6db70-303f-42e2-9d54-c2387c4e9a38

ER mimetics modulates OGD/R-induced microglial activation and angiogenesis partially via SIRT6  To gain mechanistic insights into how SIRT6 mediated the effects of ER mimetics during cerebral ischemia, shNC or shSIRT6 lentivirus-infected HAPI cells and BMVECs were pre-treated with vehicle control, metformin (10 μM) or resveratrol (10 nM) for 12 h, followed by OGD/R treatment. ER mimetics metformin or resveratrol successfully reversed the OGD/R-induced upregulation of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, and the rescue effects were abrogated in SIRT6-knockdown HAPI cells (Fig. 6A).",521b7cb9-23cd-4848-a063-a5b380bd9866
30,results19," In addition, metformin or resveratrol attenuated OGD/R-induced upregulation of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) and NLRP3 activation, whereas SIRT6 deficiency abolished the effects of metformin or resveratrol on the expression of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the effects of metformin or resveratrol on cell viability and tube formation were also attenuated in OGD/R-treated SIRT6-knockdown BMVECs (Fig. 6C, D). The protein levels of CD105, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and eNOS were further elevated while thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) was dropped upon metformin or resveratrol treatment compared to OGD/R group, while silencing of SIRT6 partially diminished this effect (Fig. 6E). These findings indicate that ER mimetics modulates OGD/R-induced microglial activation and angiogenesis partially via SIRT6.Fig.",b7ac641c-75f3-4179-b882-c8a08d6389f3

32,discussion0," ER has been recognized as a promising natural approach to overcome age-related diseases including stroke [3, 19]. ER protects against cerebral I/R-induced brain injury by inducing neuroprotective factors and suppressing inflammatory processes [19]. Consistently, our findings showed that the neurological impairments in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) IF rats were significantly improved compared with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) AL rats. IF promoted angiogenesis and inhibited microglia activation, thereby ameliorating cerebral I/R injury. Emerging evidence suggested that microglia either exacerbated or ameliorated injury following ischemic stroke, depending on the activation signal [20]. In addition, it has been illustrated that microglia was implicated in postnatal retinal angiogenesis [21]. Microglial, especially activated microglial, contributed to angiogenesis and vascular function hemostasis of co-cultured retinal microvascular endothelial cells [22].",212f1d06-49bc-4008-8211-021b68993a90
33,discussion1," On the other hand, it is well-established that cerebral I/R induced a neuroinflammatory response in central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)). In response to cerebral ischemia, microglia are activated, thus resulting in the release of cytotoxic and/or pro-inflammatory mediators [23]. They may lead to decreased cell viability of BMVECs. A number of studies have demonstrated that the cell viability of BMVECs was impaired by OGD/R [24], while tube formation is potentiated in OGD/R group [25]. Mechanistically, Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathways are activated after cerebral I/R or OGD/R stimulation, thereby facilitating angiogenesis [26]. These findings support that angiogenesis is a self-healing process after cerebral ischemia. In this study, we demonstrated that ER mimetics or SIRT6 overexpression protected BMVECs against HAPI cell activation-induced cytotoxicity. However, the association between microglial activation and angiogenesis during cerebral I/R injury remain elusive.",1ffb7744-8ef7-4d53-8cd2-616f8fefc3b7
34,discussion2," Further study is needed to further unravel the mechanism by which IF or ER mimetics activates microglia during ischemic stroke, and the crosstalk between angiogenesis and microglia activation merits further investigation.  Besides IF regimen, three ER mimetics, namely 2-DG, metformin or resveratrol, were shown to exert similar effects as IF in vivo. It is worth noting that AL rats were much heavier than IF rats. However, the body weights of rats were similar in ER mimetics in vivo model, indicating that weight-dependent effect was negligible. Growing evidence has illustrated the neuropharmacological actions of 2-DG, metformin or resveratrol in stroke. For instance, the glucose analogue 2-DG decreased ischemic brain damage and improves behavioral outcome [27]. The well-known first-line anti-diabetic drug metformin exerted beneficial effects on stroke via AMPK activation [28].",fd298b53-5f3f-4bbb-b8c7-6c4632d0d8a6
35,discussion3," Recently, resveratrol has been shown to protect ischemic injury via JAK/ERK/STAT signaling or gut-brain axis [29, 30]. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which these ER mimetics passed the blood-brain barrier (blood brain barrier (BBB)) and exerted the neuroprotective effects remain largely elusive. Different molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of these ER mimetics have been demonstrated. For instance, it has been reported that 2-DG elicited cancer cell death via blocking glycolysis, inhibiting N-linked glycosylation or activating autophagy [31, 32]. Additional studies were required to delineate whether these mechanisms can also be applied in HAPI cells or BMVECs. In this study, we have demonstrated that ER mimetics exerted neuroprotective effects via targeting SIRT6, thereby modulating thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. ER mimetics exerted the beneficial effects directly in vitro, however, the conditions are much more complicated in vivo.",d3502e24-d9fe-4b26-b9fb-a0ffa34bd020
36,discussion4," Considering that the in vitro study may not replicate the in vivo condition, future studies are need to corroborate our findings in SIRT6-deficient mice.  Sirtuin family consists of seven highly conserved sirtuins (SIRT1-7) [33]. Most attentions have been focused on SIRT1 given its well-characterized role in aging and ER-mediated beneficial effects. ER attenuated ischemic injury via inducing SIRT1 synthesis [34]. A recent study in APP mutant model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has shown that IF reduced hippocampal neuron hyperexcitability and ameliorated cognitive deficits in a SIRT3-dependent manner. Similarly, our data illustrated the critical role of SIRT6 following OGD/R in which the protective effects of ER mimetics were significantly attenuated in SIRT-6-knockdown cells, possibly through regulating thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in vitro.",def273c9-a6be-4986-9838-3457bcdf4b85
37,discussion5," Our data provided additional evidence for the neuroprotective roles of sirtuins in stroke. It is worth noting that the function of SIRT6 in central nervous system (CNS) is complicated. A study has demonstrated that SIRT6-induced autophagy also contributed to oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage in human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y cells [35], indicating that the neuroprotective or neurotoxic role of SIRT6 might depend on cell type. Moreover, SIRT6 has been shown to regulate global protein synthesis via the transcriptional factor Sp1, independent of its deacetylase activity [36], indicating that alternative SIRT6-mediated transcriptional pathway(s) might also be involved in ER-induced neuroprotection. The alternative mechanism and/or the crosstalk among different pathways should be investigated in future research.",f3fb6989-47b3-4f87-ba25-e7104e12ae0c
38,discussion6,"  thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is originally identified as an inhibitor in thioredoxin (thioredoxin (TRX)) system and plays an important role in redox homeostasis. thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) has been recognized as a crucial link between oxidative stress and inflammation activation in neurons [37]. In response to Reactive oxygen species (Reactive oxygen species (ROS)), thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) rapidly binds to NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby triggering inflammasome activation [37]. This study demonstrated that IF or ER mimetics led to a marked induction of SIRT6, alone with the reduction of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) in vivo, and SIRT6 suppressed thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) via deacetylation of H3K9ac and H3K56ac.",3567996b-6872-4204-9a9e-c7bc7004fab5
39,discussion7," Additionally, a recent report has demonstrated that depletion of SIRT6 led to an induction of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) in SIRT6 knockout ESCs, however, no significant enrichment of H3K9ac or H3K56ac has been observed on thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) locus [38]. This discrepancy suggested that the regulatory mechanism by which SIRT6 regulated thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) might be different among ESCs, HAPI cells and BMVECs. Additionally, our findings revealed that SIRT6 inhibited NLRP3 activation in HAPI cells and BMVECs, indicating that IF or ER mimetics exerted the protective effects via SIRT6-mediated thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 axis. Consistently, recent studies demonstrated the protective effects of targeting thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome in various disorders [39].",d3465ccc-1235-4e69-9a9a-f2b0ea9bc6d7
40,discussion8," Moreover, angiogenesis is an important therapeutic concept for stroke treatment as generation of new vessels enhance oxygen and nutrient supply to ischemic area, and facilitate neurogenesis [40]. thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is increasingly implicated as a key regulator of angiogenesis [15, 16], however, the role of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) in angiogenesis remains unclear. Most studies showed that enhanced thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) downregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production [41], while some demonstrated that thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) was required for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 angiogenic signal but it did not affect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels [42]. Some researchers reported that silencing of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) improved ischemia-induced revascularization in metabolic disorders [43].",fa33e9bb-0cfb-4c84-a0ab-3c6e2dc300c8
41,discussion9," Consistent with previous studies, our study showed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and eNOS were negatively correlated with thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), indicating that thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) might be involved in angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in BMVECs. These findings indicate that thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is a key player in both post-ischemic inflammation and angiogenesis.  In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ER-mediated upregulation of SIRT6 inhibited microglia activation and potentiated angiogenesis in cerebral ischemia via suppressing thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) in vitro.
