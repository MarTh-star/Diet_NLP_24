0,methods0,"2.1. Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes Eight to 10 weeks after birth, female Wistar rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) were injected intraperitoneally, after overnight starvation, with streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg body wt.) freshly dissolved in a citrate buffer (50 mM, pH 4.5). These rats were given access during the night after the injection of streptozotocin to a solution of saccharose (10 g/100 mL) to prevent possible hypoglycemia. Control rats were injected with the citrate buffer. Five days after the injection of streptozotocin, the glycemia was measured with the help of glucometer (Lifescan Benelux, Beerse, Belgium) in blood obtained from caudal vein. Only those rats displaying a glycemia in excess of 16.7 mM were kept for further investigations.  2.2.",e1ffe35e-315f-4cc9-9342-4ff140af211b
1,methods1," Starvation and Restricted Food Supply In order to compare the effects of an intermittent fasting, mimicking the Ramadan fasting, to that of a caloric restriction, the experimentation in both control and STZ rats was conducted over two successive periods. Twenty days after the injection of either streptozotocin (STZ rats) or the citrate buffer vehicle (control rats), the rats were either given free access to food throughout the experimental period (NF: nonfasting rats), deprived of food and water from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. (IF: intermittently fasting rats) or given access from 5 p.m. onwards to an amount of food comparable to that ingested by the IF rats (CR: calorie-restricted rats). Relative to the food intake in NF rats, such a caloric restriction represented a 20% decrease in food intake in the control animals and a 40% decrease of food intake in the STZ rats.  2.3.",ff901ab4-3509-4322-ab1e-fa2becffaa0c
2,methods2," Body Weight and Food Intake The initial body weight was measured before the injection of streptozotocin or its citrate buffer vehicle, 7 days thereafter, 20 days thereafter, on day 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, and 27 of the final 30 days experimental period and at sacrifice, after overnight starvation. Likewise, food intake was measured 15 to 20 days (6 measurements) after injection of STZ or its vehicle in 6 control rats and 3 groups of 5-6 STZ rats, and daily (26 measurements) during the last 30 days experimental period.  2.4. Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT)) An Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) [14, 15] was conducted in all rats on day 10, 20, and 29 of the final 30 days experimental period, after overnight starvation. A solution of D-glucose (20%, w/v) in distilled H2O was intraperitoneally injected in conscious rats in order to deliver 2 g D-glucose per kg body weight.",e68c812c-de1b-4c2b-8fea-20afdba64658
3,methods3," The glycemia was measured by a glucometer before and 30, 60, and 120 min after the administration of D-glucose in blood samples obtained from a caudal vein. The total and incremental areas under the glycemic curve (areas under the glycemic curve (AUC)) were computed in each individual experiment.  2.5. Sacrifice At the end of the experimental period, the rats were sacrificed after overnight starvation and under anesthesia provoked by the intraperitoneal injection of a solution containing ketamine and xylocaine. Blood samples were obtained from the heart and placed in heparinized tubes, the plasma being then separated by centrifugation and stored at −80°C. The plasma D-glucose [16] and insulin [17] concentrations were measured by methods described in the cited references. These measurements were used to calculate the insulinogenic index (i.e.",96f7c2d6-6f18-4d39-b896-2d3da30f33d1

The pancreas were either used for the isolation of islets or fixed for immunohistochemical examination.  2.6. Insulin Secretion In Vitro Groups of 4 islets each, obtained by the collagenase procedure [18], were incubated at 37°C for 90 min in 0.5 mL of a salt-balanced medium [19] containing bovine serum albumin (5 mg/mL) and equilibrated against a mixture of O2/CO2 (95/5, v/v). The insulin released by the islets during incubation and their final insulin content were measured by radioimmunoassay [17].  2.7.",d2fbc5c7-5324-4059-822b-0250e0eaa34a
5,methods5," Immunohistochemical Study For immunodetection of insulin, pancreatic rehydrated paraffin sections were blocked 1 h at room temperature with 1 : 20 normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) in PBS for nonspecific reactions. The slides were incubated with primary anti-insulin (12018, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) mouse monoclonal antibody overnight at 4°C at a concentration of 1/3000 in normal goat serum (1/20 in PBS). The secondary antibody, Rhodamine Red X-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (115-295-146, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) was applied at a dilution of 1/200 in PBS/normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were mounted, and DNA was counterstained with DAPI (In Vitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium). The staining patterns were observed with an Axioplan and recorded with an Axiocam (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).  2.8.",d2771338-b0cf-4161-9f3b-2f24032f7cfb
6,methods6," β-Cell Mass Assessment Pancreatic sections were stained for insulin using standard avidin biotin peroxidase complex (ABC)-DAB technique [20]. The slides were incubated overnight at 4°C with the first antibody: anti-insulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA) at dilution 1 : 500 in PBS with appropriate blocking serum at a dilution of 1/20. Purified immunoglobulins (IgG) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) from nonimmunized rabbit were used as negative controls. The slides were further incubated with the secondary biotinylated antibody: goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (BA-1000, Vector Laboratories) at a dilution of 1/300 in PBS for 30 min, at room temperature. β-cell mass was measured by point-counting morphometry on these immunoperoxidase-stained sections [21]. The measurement was performed on live using Leica Microsystems microscope (Heerbrugg, Switzerland). A grill of 110 points was used to assess insulin positive stained islet on each field.  2.9.",b54f26f7-01f5-4e53-95c9-e5528185bd57
7,methods7," Individual β-Cell Area Individual β-cell area was determined by using image J logician on immunofluorescence stained sections of pancreas used for β-cell apoptosis assessment. The β-cell area was calculated from the ratio between individual area and β-cell nuclei number within the area taken in consideration.  2.10. Glucagon Immunodetection For glucagon immunodetection, the same procedure as that described for insulin immunodetection by the avidin biotin peroxidase complex (ABC)-DAB technique [20] was used. The sole difference consisted in the first antibody, that is, antiglucagon (A0565, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) used at dilution 1 : 400.  2.11. Apoptosis Detection The quantification of β-cell apoptosis by the TUNEL method was performed using the in situ Cell Death Detection kit, POD (Roche Diagnostics, Vilvorde, Belgium).",478f62bc-a104-45bc-bb9d-69a635ffc4a4
8,methods8," At the end of this procedure, the pancreatic sections were rinsed with PBS and eventually exposed overnight at 4°C to primary anti-insulin antibody (see above) followed by exposition for 30 min at 20°C to the Rhodamine Red X-conjugated secondary antibody (1/200 dilution). The apoptotic index represents the ratio between positive and total nuclei of insulin-producing cells in each islet.  2.12. Presentation of Results All results are presented as mean values (±SEM), together with the number of separate determinations (n). The statistical significance of differences between mean values was assessed by use of Student's t-test.  3. Results 3.1. Body Weight At day zero of the last 30 days experimental period, the mean body weights of the control and STZ rats did not differ significantly (P > 0.52) from one another, with an overall mean value of 223 ± 4 g (n = 33).",36f1a5b9-483f-4a36-a1ee-2439c5b38d91
9,methods9," Over the 2 weeks following the injection of either streptozotocin or the citrate buffer vehicle, the changes in body weight averaged +17.6 ± 4.0 g (n = 16) in control rats, as distinct (P < 0.005) from −2.0 ± 5.0 g (n = 17) in STZ rats. Over the last 30 days of the experiments, the changes in body weight failed to differ significantly, whether in the control or STZ rats, when comparing IF animals to NF animals, with overall mean values of +33.8 ± 2.7 g (n = 10) in the control rats and −15.9 ± 4.4 g (n = 11) in the STZ rats. Expressed as a daily change in body weight, these two mean values were not significantly different (P > 0.4 or more) from those recorded in the same type of rats (control or STZ) over the 2-week period following the injection of streptozotocin or the citrate buffer vehicle. Over the last 30 days of the experiments, the gain in body weight was much lower (P < 0.04 or less) in the CR animals than in the IF animals, with mean values of +6.0 ± 3.",a7a09f74-5fdf-4b4b-aaac-a4ed3bd0f175

Food Intake As indicated in Table 1, the food intake over the last 6 days of the control period (day 15 to day 20 after the injection of STZ or its solvent), was more than twice higher (P < 0.001) in the STZ rats than in the control animals. Such a difference persisted when comparing fed control and STZ rats over the 30 days experimental period. In the IF and CR rats examined during the last 30 days experimental period, the food intake was again almost twice higher (P < 0.001) in STZ rats than in control animals.  The individual values considered in Table 1 represented the mean of 6–26 measurements in each rat. During the last 6 days of the control period, the variation coefficient (SD/mean) for the 6 successive measurements made in each rat amounted to 7.3 ± 0.",160e81b6-2e08-4250-9852-464ef16614f4

Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) The paired difference between the glycemia at min 30 and min zero of the Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) was comparable (P > 0.77) in control rats (6.31 ± 0.62 mM; n = 48) and STZ rats (6.68 ± 1.15 mM; n = 52).   The profile of glycemia during the Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) conducted in control rats is illustrated in Figure 2.

However, as documented by the data listed in Table 2, the incremental areas under the glycemic curve (AUC) tended to be lower in IF and CR control rats than in fed control rats. Thus, the values recorded in IF and CR control rats, respectively, averaged 59.1 ± 15.3% (n = 16) and 65.3 ± 9.5% (n = 17) of the mean corresponding values recorded on the same day in the fed control rats (100.0 ± 15.1%; n = 15).

Hence, these results were pooled together. Likewise, the results of the Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) conducted on day 10, 20, and 29 of the final experimental period were pooled together in either the IF or CR STZ rats (Figure 3). The time zero glycemia was lower (P < 0.007 or less) in IF rats than in either NF or CR rats, no significant difference (P > 0.24) being observed between the latter two groups of STZ rats (Table 3). Likewise, the total areas under the glycemic curve (AUC) was lower (P < 0.001) in IF rats than in either NF or CR rats, which failed to differ significantly (P > 0.21) from one another.

In the control rats, it was comparable (P > 0.49 or more) in NF, IF, and CR animals (Table 4). In the STZ rats, however, the overall mean value found in the IF and CR animals (24.63 ± 2.91; n = 12) was significantly lower (P < 0.04) than that recorded in the NF STZ rats.   The plasma insulin concentration was about twice lower in STZ rats than in control animals.

In each of these two sets of rats, no significant difference was found between NF, IF or CR animals. At the most, there was a trend (P < 0.09) towards a higher value for the insulinogenic index in IF and CR diabetic rats (1.17 ± 0.34 mU/mmol; n = 12) than in the NF STZ rats (0.48 ± 0.08 mU/mmol; n = 5).",6e881eff-72c5-4b53-8b1a-e0d584bd09fe

Parallel experiments were here conducted in control animals.  As expected, the glycemia (or plasma D-glucose concentration) and the total areas under the glycemic curve (AUC) during an Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) were much higher in STZ rats than in control animals. Even the incremental areas under the glycemic curve (AUC) during the Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) was higher (P < 0.006) in STZ rats (608 ± 105 mM·min; n = 52) than in control animals (287 ± 29 mM·min; n = 48) despite a comparable initial increment in glycemia 30 min after the injection of D-glucose.",c0626c3d-ec37-4694-8219-0ebb0d77e039
26,methods27," Also, as expected, the plasma insulin concentration, the insulinogenic index, the secretion of insulin by isolated islets, their insulin content, the relative volume occupied by the β-cells in serial sections of the whole pancreas and the individual islet area were much lower in STZ rats than in control animals. Incidentally, a positive secretory response to D-glucose was still observed in isolated pancreatic islets from STZ rats, this coinciding with a progressive decrease in their final insulin content after incubation at increasing concentrations of D-glucose. Such a decrease was not observed, however, in pancreatic islets from control animals. Last, the HOMA for insulin resistance and percentage of apoptotic β-cells were also significantly higher in STZ rats than in control animals.   In terms of morphological findings, there was, as a rule, little to distinguish between NF, IF, and CR control animals. At the most, there was a trend (P < 0.",c6021a37-e47f-443a-bd17-8cd34bc268cd
27,methods28,"02) towards a higher individual β-cell area in IF than in NF control rats. Moreover, the pancreatic wet weight and, hence, total β-cell mass appeared lower (P < 0.04 or less) in IF control rats than in NF control rats. A comparable situation (P < 0.02) prevailed when comparing the pancreatic wet weight in IF STZ rats and NF STZ rats.   In the STZ rats, the major other changes attributable to differences in feeding schedule concerned, in terms of morphological findings, the relative and absolute values for β-cell mass, the individual β-cell and islet area and the percentage of apoptotic β-cells. In the IF STZ rats, the relative and absolute values for β-cell mass, as well as the individual β-cell area and islet area, were all higher than in NF STZ rats, whilst the percentage of apoptotic cells appeared lower in IF than NF STZ rats. In the CR STZ rats, comparable findings were restricted to the individual islet area and percentage of apoptotic cells.",e0930f55-09ee-497b-a19f-c1da5d6e241a
28,methods29,"   The much higher percentage of apoptotic β-cells in STZ rats, as compared to control animals, is likely attributable to two major factors. First, the β-cell cytotoxic effect of STZ should not be ignored. According to Morimoto et al. [22], apoptosis of β-cells is already detected 6 hours after the injection of STZ, even before the onset of hyperglycemia. In this respect, it should be kept in mind that 3 to 14 days after STZ administration, infiltration of the islets by mononuclear cells takes place, eventually resulting in the removal of apoptotic cells by unspecific macrophages [23, 24]. Hence, the present data may well underestimate the apoptosis index otherwise prevailing during the first days after STZ administration. A second factor consists of the hyperglycemia resulting from STZ administration, since in vitro exposure of pancreatic islets to high concentrations of glucose also induces β-cell apoptosis [24].",1bebbd7a-dd5a-4399-b631-2810d57c149b
29,methods30,"   The latter process may account, in part at least, for the apparent differences between IF and CR STZ rats, in terms of both relative β-cell mass and individual β-cell area. Thus, according to the data listed in Tables 3 and 4, the glycemia (or plasma D-glucose concentration) after overnight starvation, expressed relative to the mean corresponding values found in NF STZ rats averaged in the IF STZ rats 64.9 ± 5.7% (n = 21), as distinct (P < 0.01) from 86.6 ± 5.6% (n = 23) in the CR STZ rats. The mean values for both the total and incremental areas under the glycemic curve (AUC) during the Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) were also higher in CR STZ rats than in IF STZ rats (Table 3). Such differences in glucose homeostasis coincided with higher mean values for both the relative volume of β-cells and their individual area in IF STZ rats as distinct from CR STZ rats (Tables 5 and 6).",a5967be3-520e-42e0-a76d-c6fa84720051
30,methods31," Thus, the mean relative value of β-cells was almost twice higher in IF than CR STZ rats, whilst the mean individual β-cell area represented in the IF STZ rats 125.4 ± 6.0% (n = 20; P < 0.002) of that found in CR STZ rats (100.0 ± 4.0%; n = 20). Despite the vastly different magnitude of the IF/CR ratio for these two variables, the difference between CR and IF STZ rats remained highly significant (P < 0.005) when pooling together the results recorded for each of these variables.   The individual β-cell area was also always significantly higher in STZ rats than in control animals exposed to the same dietary schedule (Table 6).",8ce4e968-7d23-4635-979d-90dddf090133
31,methods32," These converging findings concerning differences in individual β-cell area as a function of glucose tolerance are reminiscent of the hypertrophy of β-cells found either in vitro after exposure to a high concentration of D-glucose [25] or in vivo in rats which became hyperglycemic after partial pancreatectomy [26] and currently ascribed to a compensatory mechanism in residual β-cells no more susceptible to undergo mitosis [27].    The latter consideration is not meant to deny that in addition to β-cell hypertrophy, an increase in β-cell number, possibly attributable to transdifferentiation of glucagon-producing to insulin-producing cells [28, 29], may participate in the difference in relative or total β-cell mass between NF and IF STZ rats, as also suggested by the total cell numbers listed in Table 7.   A beneficial effect of intermittent fasting from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m.",d7deac2d-a181-4b7f-9170-dfc3c2efde08
32,methods33," in STZ rats was documented by a decrease in glycemia at time zero of the Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT), a decrease in the total glycemic areas under the glycemic curve (AUC) during the Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT), a lower plasma D-glucose concentration at sacrifice after overnight starvation, and a trend towards a higher plasma insulin concentration and insulinogenic index and a lower HOMA index at sacrifice. For the latter three variables, the geometric means of the relevant variable (plasma insulin concentration, insulinogenic index, and inverse of HOMA index) yielded a significant difference (P < 0.025) between NF (100.0 ± 6.9%; n = 15) and IF (164.4 ± 29.5%; n = 18) STZ rats. Furthermore, no significant adverse effect of intermittent fasting (P > 0.49) was observed in terms of the changes in body weight of the STZ rats over the 30 days final experimental period, when comparing NF animals (−12.4 ± 2.8 g; n = 5) to IF rats (−18.8 ± 7.9 g; n = 6).",5ad0f256-718d-4627-9aaf-46b295053417
33,methods34,"   A different situation prevailed in the calorie-restricted STZ rats. No statistically significant beneficial effects of caloric restriction in the STZ rats was observed when comparing NF to CR diabetic animals. Moreover, the decrease in body weight observed in the STZ rats during the final 30 days experimental period was 2.5 to 3.8 times higher (P < 0.001) in CR rats than in IF and NF animals, respectively.   Even in control rats, the gain in body weight was much lower in CR animals than in IF ones (Figure 1). This coincided with lower mean values for the plasma insulin concentration, insulinogenic index, and HOMA index in IF control rats than in CR control rats examined at sacrifice after overnight starvation (Table 4). Thus, for these three variables, the values recorded in IF control rats averaged 71.6 ± 8.6% (n = 15; P < 0.06) of the mean corresponding values found in CR control rats (100.0 ± 11.5%; n = 15).",5b242e2f-e74e-492a-8df3-a9df5795e443
34,methods35," Since such distinctions between IF and CR control rats could not be ascribed to any difference in either food intake or the responsiveness to D-glucose of isolated pancreatic islets incubated in vitro, they suggest a more stressful situation in CR control rats than in IF control animals. To a large extent, a comparable situation may prevail in CR as distinct from IF diabetic animals.   In conclusion, therefore, the present study allows to extend to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, the proposal that intermittent fasting exerts a beneficial effect on glucose tolerance [11–13]. In our opinion, such a dietary approach merits to be also considered as a possible approach to prevent or minimize, if not correct, disturbances of glucose homeostasis in human subjects.
