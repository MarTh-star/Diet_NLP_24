0,methods0," 2.1. Animal Experiments  The C57BL/6 wild-type male mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The animals were housed in standard specific-pathogen-free conditions with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and controlled temperature and humidity. Mice were randomly divided into experimental groups of eight animals, each as follows: ad libitum chow-fed control mice (Ad lib); ketogenic diet (KD) ad libitum for 4 weeks (80% energy from fat, 15% energy from protein, and 5% from carbohydrates; diet composition as previously published [24]); CR mice submitted to 14 days constant restriction with 80% of regular ad libitum chow intake as previously applied in our experiments [11,",acba6229-f300-452a-8875-594f254f752d
1,methods1,"23]; IF group with mice fasted every other day for 24 h (100% restriction) with a 24 h chow ad libitum refeeding period for a total of 28 days; fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group submitted to three cycles of 4 days of fasting (50% kcal of ad libitum intake on day one and 10% kcal on days 2–4) with 7 days of refeeding as described before [5]. The fasting mimicking diet (FMD) diet consists of vitamin and mineral-rich broth, vegetable mix, and oils blended in a low-caloric paste and dosed daily. The experimental setup aimed at exposing mice to an approximately similar level of restriction. Therefore, the strictest restriction was applied for the shortest time. The experiments were initiated so that the animals were age-matched (16 weeks old) on the dissection day. Therefore, the treatment was started at ages 12, 14, 12, and 13 for KD, CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD), respectively. All eight animals per group that started the treatment survived until the end of the experiment.",58920177-4d98-4841-b7ed-2118aec33482

Shortly after, 10–15 μg frozen cecum content was homogenized in Precellys homogenizing tubes containing extraction buffer (methanol:chloroform:water; 2.5:1:0.5) and 1.4 mm ceramic beads. After vortexing and centrifuging the samples for 5 min at 10,000× g at 4 °C, 600 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and the extraction was repeated. One hundred microliters of the combined supernatant was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator for 60 min at 45 °C. Dried pellets were resuspended in 150 μL acetonitrile:water (1:1) and 40 μL 40 mM 2-NPH, 40 μL 250 mM EDC, and 40 μL 3% pyridine, and incubated for 30 min at 60 °C.

Samples were kept at 10 °C before analysis by LC-MS using an Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Scientific) and a micrOTOF-Q II (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with an Atlantis T3 3 μm column (2.1 × 150 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Mobile phase B (acetonitrile) was increased from 5% (0–2.5 min) to 90% (8 min), followed by a 5 min hold at 90%, then the column was washed with 95% mobile phase A (H2O) for 2 min; both solvents contained 0.1% formic acid.  2.8.2. Bile Acids Quantification  Extraction and measurement of BAs were carried out as described previously [23]. Briefly, after adding nine times the volume of methanol to the samples, approximately 7 mg of small intestinal samples were cut and homogenized in Precellys tubes with 1.4 mm ceramic beads.

10,methods10," After repeating the centrifugation step, supernatants were pipetted into HPLC vials and were analyzed by LC-MS in positive modus using an LCMS-8040 Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) with an Atlantis T3 3 μm column (2.1 × 150 mm, Waters). The column temperature was kept at 30 °C. Gradient started from 30% B (acetonitrile/methanol (3/1), v/v) and 70% A (water). After 5 min, B was increased to 100% within 20 min and kept constant for 20 min. Afterward, the mobile phase was set back to 30% B for 10 min. Both solvents contained 0.1% formic acid with 20 mM ammonium acetate.  2.8.3. Untargeted Metabolomics  Plasma samples (25 µL) were treated with 150 µL of cooled acetonitrile. Following equilibration for 30 min on ice, the suspension was centrifuged (10 min, 12,000 rpm, 4 °C). The clear supernatant was transferred into 1.5 mL autosampler vials with 250 µL inserts and stored at −20 °C until further analysis.",f2235987-ee52-49b3-9848-e921bce977c9
11,methods11,"  UHPLC-TOF-MS/MS analysis was performed using an Exion LC UHPLC system (Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany) connected to a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer (Sciex) using electrospray ionization (electrospray ionization (ESI)) in positive and negative mode. The UHPLC systems consisted of two Exion LC AD pumps, an Exion LC degasser, an Exion LC AC column oven, an Exion LC AD autosampler, and an Exion LC controller. Chromatography was carried out using a RP18 stationary phase (Kinetex C18, 100 × 2 mm, particle size 1.7 μm; Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) using a constant flow rate of 0.25 mL/min at a column temperature of 40 °C.

12,methods12," The injection volume of all samples was 1 μL, and the autosampler was maintained at 10 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the Information Dependent Acquisition mode (Information Dependent Acquisition mode (IDA)) for fragment spectra measurement. After starting with a high-resolution scan of the intact precursor ions from 50 to 1000 m/z for 250 ms, fragment ions were generated by means of collision-induced fragmentation for the eight most abundant precursor ions per cycle. The resulting fragment spectra were recorded in the high sensitivity mode between 50 and 1000 m/z (50 ms acquisition per experiment). Ion spray voltage was set at −4500 V in negative and 5500 V in positive mode.

For normalization of longitudinal shifts during data acquisition, a quality check (QC) sample was prepared by mixing aliquots (10 µL) of each sample. The combined QC sample was injected into the LC-MS system after every five samples, while samples were analyzed after randomization for the avoidance of batch effects.  Raw mass spectrometry data was converted to the mzML file format using Proteowizard [26] and subsequently processed using the xcms package (version 3.18.0, open source software available at Bioconductor [27]) within the statistical programming environment R (version 4.2.1; open source software available at https://cran.r-project.org, accessed on 25 July 2022).",0a2bea96-b46f-48b7-a8f0-429ef74ffd35

15,methods15," Results  3.1. All Restrictive Diets Modulate the Expression of Inflammatory and Antibacterial Factors  In order to compare the impact of selected restrictive diets on the intestine, five groups of eight mice were randomly assigned one of the diets of interest: CR, IF, fasting mimicking diet (FMD), KD, and control diet. The control mice were fed standard chow ad libitum. Animals from all diet groups involving energy restriction lost body weight, with the CR group having the lowest body weight on the last day of the experiment (Figure 1A). Correspondingly, CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) mice showed decreased epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) mass with the greatest change for CR (Supplementary Figure S1A). KD did not affect body or eWAT weight.",82899ab0-f071-4d2c-ba7a-ddff63469796
16,methods16," Following on our previous report showing that CR is associated with the downregulation of inflammatory genes in the mucosa along the GI tract [11], we first compared the impact of the diets on the expression of Stat1, Irf1, and TNFα in the mucosa of the jejunum and proximal colon. In general, each of the restrictive diets showed a statistically significant impact or a trend to decrease the expression of Stat1 and Irf1 in the proximal colon (Figure 1C). The mRNA expression in the jejunum (Figure 1B) and proximal colon (Figure 1C), as well as protein level in the jejunum (Figure 1D) for TNFα, was not affected by any of the diets. To further explore the potential of the diets in modulating the immune status in the GI tract, the protein levels of total NFκB and its phosphorylated form (p-NFκB (Ser536)) were quantified in the jejunum mucosa (Figure 1E,F).",e1ae3d01-b4df-4e6d-b260-9fe035a0b294
17,methods17," Although no statistically significant impact has been observed, KD, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) resulted in a trend of increased levels of IKB, an inhibitor of NFκB [31] (Figure 1G,H). Similar to the jejunum, in the proximal colon, the level of p-NFκB (Ser536) was not affected by any of the diets (Figure 1I,J). Protein levels of cytokines and inflammatory factors were assessed in the epithelium of the jejunum; however, no changes were found in the levels of IFNɣ, TGFβ1, MIP3α, and IL17F, regardless of the diet (Supplementary Figure S1B–E). Further, the expressions of the cytokines and inflammatory factors were assessed in the mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. Surprisingly, Stat1 gene expression was increased in Peyer’s patches of IF and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) mice (Figure 1K), while the expression of Irf1 matched the results in the jejunum and colon mucosa.",15502cdd-ae43-41be-99ce-88dda33ff16f
18,methods18," Among the diets, fasting mimicking diet (FMD) and IF showed the strongest impact on the expression of tested genes in Peyer’s patches. Further, the expression of the corresponding set of genes was analyzed in the superior mesenteric lymph nodes to picture the impact of immune factors circulating in the vessels surrounding the GI tract (Figure 1L). In general, the impact of the treatments was much milder in the lymph nodes compared to the intestinal mucosa and Peyer’s patches, and it was comparable between the diets.  To assess immune status in the GI tract, the abundance of CD45+ cells was measured in Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. A stronger impact was observed for Peyer’s patches, where KD triggered a decrease in the percentage of the cells, and CR showed a similar tendency (Supplementary Figure S1F). The percentage of the cells was not statistically significantly affected in mesenteric lymph nodes of any of the diet groups (Supplementary Figure S1G).  3.2.",b5ccd639-beb3-46d3-91ce-2da4d8f094a5
19,methods19," Microbiota Composition Changes Depend on Energy and Macronutrients Restriction  Seeing that each of the diets can affect the immune status and suspecting consequent impact on gut microbiota, the gene expression of antimicrobial factors was analyzed. Oas1a and Nod2 mRNA expression was statistically significantly downregulated in the jejunum mucosa of all of the diet groups compared to the control (Figure 2A). Additionally, the expression of MyD88, Reg3γ, and Tlr3 genes was also decreased, although not all the differences were statistically significant. In general, KD consistently showed the strongest impact on gene expression. Only KD tended to reduce the expression of Tlr3, while Rsad2 was not affected by any of the diets (Figure 2A). A similar effect with additional downregulation of Rasd2 and a greater impact on Tlr3 was observed in Peyer’s patches (Figure 2B). In this tissue, KD and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) seemed to have the most pronounced effect.",26992ad9-4718-443f-ae12-f776d2178945
20,methods20," The impact of the diets was much milder in the mucosa of proximal colon and mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure 2C,D). Surprisingly, and contrary to jejunum and Peyer’s patches, the expression of Tlr3 and Nod2 was increased by IF and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) in the proximal colon (Figure 2C). In mesenteric lymph nodes, the expression of MyD88 showed a strong decreasing trend for all of the diets, and there was no consistent impact of the treatments on any of the other tested genes (Figure 2D). Recognizing that all of the tested restrictive diets regulate the synthesis of antimicrobial factors in the jejunum and Peyer’s patches on the gene expression level, the consequences of these regulations were verified by analysis of the relative abundance of selected bacteria in mice feces. The bacteria types were chosen based on our previous observations of microbiota composition changes during CR [11,22].",73b3ce99-3af5-4052-a0cf-2dbccad43f1d
21,methods21," There were no differences in the abundance of phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroides in the feces of ad libitum-fed compared to the diet groups (Figure 3A, Figure S1G). However, KD and CR groups tended to differ from IF and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) groups (Figure 3A). Despite a similar effect on the expression of antimicrobial genes, for all of the tested diets, KD had opposing effects on the abundance of several bacteria compared to the other restrictive diets. CR and IF increased relative Lactobacillus levels, while KD depleted them (Figure 3B). A corresponding contrasting trend between CR and KD was observed for Parasuttella (Figure 3C). CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) diminished Deferribacteres levels, but KD raised it (Figure 3D). Of the tested bacteria, only Akkermansia was consistently stimulated by each diet; however, it was not statistically significant (Figure 3E).  3.3.",d4305bfe-ab7c-4598-8c20-50fa610e90f7
22,methods22," Metabolites Composition Changes Depend on Energy and Macronutrients Restriction  Considering the role of microbiota in short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and medium-chain fatty acids (medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)) synthesis, the levels of the fatty acids were measured in the cecum content of the animals submitted to the dietary treatments. CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) consistently decreased the levels of acetate (C2), butyrate (C4), and caproate (C6) cecal fatty acids (Figure 3F,G). KD resulted in the reduction of C4 to a similar extent as CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD), but it did not affect C2, propionate (C3), or valerate (C5). Concerning medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) reduced the levels of cecal C6, fasting mimicking diet (FMD) increased caprylate (C8) level, while IF and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) showed a trend towards reduction of laurate (C12).",e38d249d-c46e-4933-98f5-ee86ec2820bc
23,methods23," Caprate (C10) was detected only in the cecum of KD mice (Supplementary Figure S1H). Crucially, KD was supplemented with medium chain fatty acids (MCFA); therefore, its levels were very high in the cecum (Supplementary Figure S1H). Interestingly, cecum size was decreased in KD-fed mice, while energy-restricted mice tended to have enlarged cecum (Figure 3H).  The evinced mutual regulation involving gut microbiota and BAs [32,33] prompted us to analyze the levels of BAs in the epithelium of the ileum. Increased levels of UDCA, DCA, CDCA, and CA were found for CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD), as well as TDCA for IF and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) (Figure 3I–M). Whereas KD did not trigger changes in the level of any of the tested BAs. A similar trend was observed for BAs UDCA, DCA, and CA in the plasma (Figure 3N–P).",25fb1d0c-ebdd-4a18-ab2d-61b2f4b6b059
24,methods24,"  Further analysis of plasma metabolites indicated clear metabolites clustering with a distinctive profile for KD and control diet, while IF, CR, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) were most alike (Figure 4A,B).  3.4. Restrictive Diets Affect Mucin Production and Intestine Morphology  As microbiota and interleukins are some of the major factors contributing to goblet cell differentiation and mucus production, we performed staining of the colon (Figure 5A, replicates in Supplementary Figure S2A) and small intestine (Figure 5B). The diet treatments, particularly CR and IF, seemed to moderately increase the intensity of the staining of the colon sections. Similarly, in the small intestine, the diets resulted in a modest increase in the number of goblet cells; however, the difference was not statistically significant (Figure 5C). The mRNA expression of Muc13 in jejunum mucosa was higher in CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) groups compared to ad libitum-fed mice (Figure 5D).",f373906f-73be-4aa6-9372-75f704fda989
25,methods25," On the contrary, Muc2 gene expression was not statistically significantly affected (Figure 5D). Also, the diets did not change the expression of Muc2 or Muc13 genes in the proximal colon mucosa (Figure 5E). Overall, the results suggest possible modest changes in mucus production in the GI tract of mice submitted to CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD).  We then further investigated morphological changes triggered by the diets. KD resulted in the accumulation of lipid droplets within the villi (Figure 5F, Supplementary Figure S2B). In the small intestine, KD increased the villi length, while CR and IF showed a similar trend (Figure 5F,G). Also, KD and CR showed a trend towards reduced crypt depth (Figure 5H) and KD towards reduced intestinal muscularis externa thickness (Figure 5I). The changes were accompanied by decreased levels of zonulin (ZO-1) mRNA, while occludin gene expression was not affected in the mucosa of the jejunum (Figure 6A).",236023e6-b53c-42fa-a238-d32ef5bf6e21
26,methods26," Interestingly, the protein level of 65 kDa occludin was not changed during the diet treatment (Figure 6B), but KD triggered the occurrence of a shorter 50 kDa form of occludin (Figure 6C,D). In the colon, the protein and mRNA expression of occludin and ZO-1 was not changed upon diet exposure (Figure 6E–H).  3.5. Modulation of Autophagy, Mitochondria, and Oxidative Stress by Restrictive Diets  The beneficial outcomes of CR and IF are partly due to stimulation of autophagy, impact on mitochondrial function, and reduction of oxidative stress [34,35]. Therefore, we assessed the expression of markers of these features. First, there was no statistically significant impact of the diets on ATG7 protein expression (Figure 7A,B), whereas all of the diets tended to stimulate LC3 protein; however, only the impact of KD was statistically significant (Figure 7C,D). No impact on Atg7, Atg12, or Lc3 mRNA levels was measured in the jejunum mucosa (Figure 7E).",add11369-9399-4d17-ab75-401ed02b88da
27,methods27," In the mucosa of the proximal colon, the protein levels of ATG7 and LC3 were not affected (Figure 7F–I), although there was a trend towards increased expression of ATG7. The expression of the Atg7 gene was increased by fasting mimicking diet (FMD), CR, and nearly statistically significantly by KD (Figure 7J). The levels of Atg12 and Lc3 mRNA were not affected. Further, mitochondrial DNA levels in the mucosa of the jejunum tended to be increased by KD and CR (Figure 7K). Ucp2 and Tfam mRNA expression in the intestinal mucosa were not affected by the diets (Figure 7L). Whereas TOMM20 protein levels were stimulated by KD and IF (Figure 7M,N). In the mucosa of the proximal colon, TOMM20 and Ucp2 expression was not changed, whereas Tfam mRNA levels were reduced in KD and similarly tended to be decreased in CR and IF mice (Figure 7O–R). Finally, the expression of anti-oxidative enzymes was assessed.",cdc7265c-2bad-4784-b9a3-f51d7c646af8
28,methods28," The levels of MnSOD mRNA were decreased by most of the diets in the mucosa of the jejunum (Figure 7S). Trx2 showed a similar trend, whereas the gene expression of glutathione transferases (Mgst1, Gsta3) tended to be elevated. The gene expression pattern for MnSOD was similar in the mucosa of the jejunum and proximal colon (Figure 7T). The expression of Trx2 was not affected in the colon, and only fasting mimicking diet (FMD) modified the expression of Catalase, Mgst1, and Gsta3.  3.6. The Impact of Restrictive Diets on the Markers of Energy Limitation  Next, the factors previously found to be associated with energy restriction, including serine-threonine kinase AKT, metallothionein 2 (Mt2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1- α (PGC-1α) α were assessed.",304ddaed-6704-4ee0-a75c-c4dc4cfbde3e
29,methods29," The dietary restrictions resulted in an increase in phosphorylated AKT levels in the jejunum mucosa of fasting mimicking diet (FMD)-fed mice and a similar trend was observed for the other diets (Figure 8A,B). KD, CR, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) had the strongest stimulating impact on Mt2 and Pgc1α mRNA expression in the jejunum (Figure 8C). In the colon, the effect was much less pronounced with p-AKT not being affected, and statistically significant results were observed only for KD on Mt2 mRNA (Figure 8D–F).  4. Discussion  This work presents a comprehensive study comparing the impact of restrictive diets on the gut in the context of inflammation, microbiota, gut morphology, autophagy, mitochondria, and restriction-specific parameters. In general, the applied diets are very similar in terms of reduction of the expression of inflammatory genes and proteins; antimicrobial genes; mucus production; gut morphology; and autophagy-, mitochondria-, and restriction-related factors.",04fbdd2e-b89c-43d5-b3c2-9a9ceb9a2d87
30,methods30," However, they differ in terms of their effect on microbiota and BAs composition as well as the occurrence of occludin 55 kDa. Scrutinizing the magnitude of the impact of the diets, fasting mimicking diet (FMD) and KD most consistently had the strongest effect. Notably, the outcomes were observed in several sections of the GI tract. Noteworthy, the impact on the jejunum was much more pronounced compared to the proximal colon.  Considering similarities and differences of the studied diets, they can be grouped by carbohydrates restriction (KD and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) vs. CR and IF), ketogenic properties (with KD having the strongest), temporal restrain (IF and fasting mimicking diet (FMD)), or the total energy restriction (CR and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) vs. IF and KD). The common pathway strongly affected by all of the diets is insulin signaling.",08791ef0-29a3-4a29-8424-864aa4aac7cb
31,methods31," Therefore, with this study comparison between the impact of reduced insulin signaling and ketones signaling versus energy depletion may be claimed. However, one also needs to bear in mind the impact of the consumed nutrients. The composition of KD strongly differed from chow given to CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) mice. Importantly, fasting mimicking diet (FMD) received highly nutritious supplements during the restriction cycles. Further, KD is fed ad libitum while CR, IF, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) diets are associated with reduced energy intake and hunger. Taking into account this essential difference compared to the other restrictive diets as well as the range of performed assays, the overall outcomes and scale of changes were unexpectedly similar between all the diets.  Our study analyzed the outcomes of the relatively new but intensively researched dietary protocol fasting mimicking diet (FMD).",99f0455d-88f3-4e14-8184-0d733e1526b5
32,methods32," fasting mimicking diet (FMD) ameliorates the symptoms and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [14,15]; however, the diet has never been investigated in the intestine in the context of basic, non-diseased conditions. We show that fasting mimicking diet (FMD) impacts similar parameters as other restrictive diets. However, it has a somewhat stronger impact on the protein levels of p-AKT, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) cecum levels, and anti-oxidative and antimicrobial gene expression. Considering that fecal transplant from fasting mimicking diet (FMD) mice contributes to neuroprotection in Parkinson’s disease mouse model [18], the here-reported similarities in the gut microbiota of fasting mimicking diet (FMD), IF, and CR mice hint at corresponding therapeutic properties of IF and CR.",b2e0a0bf-e3bc-47d8-910c-01fd08ec2dab
33,methods33," Overall, our results imply that fasting mimicking diet (FMD) can be applied as a preventive measure to maintain low-immune reactivity, improve gut microbiota and bacteria metabolites composition, as well as manage oxidative stress.  KD has been applied for over 100 years to reduce the occurrence of epileptic seizures; however, there is a limited amount of information concerning its impact on the GI tract. In our study, KD was distinguished from the other applied diets by its impact on the microbiota and BAs composition, as well as the occurrence of 50 kDa occludin. The truncated 50-kDa occludin form is likely not a distinct translated product but a proteolytic fragment whose presence is associated with increased activity of metalloproteinases and disruption of the overall tight junction complex [36,37]. Correspondingly, low levels of tight-junctional resistance correlate positively with the 50-kDa form and negatively with the 65-kDa form in human cervical epithelial CaSki cells [38].",21e0a0db-d186-41b6-9b7b-6080e215a844
34,methods34," Notably, in the intestine, the role of different isoforms remains unexplored.  Previously, we showed that CR reduces the expression of inflammatory genes along the intestinal tract [11,22]. Several restrictive diets have been previously shown to extinguish inflammation and attenuate autoimmune diseases. Importantly, inflammation also serves as an important marker of regeneration [14]. Here, we show that all the applied restrictive diets have similar properties in terms of down- and also upregulation of the gene expression of inflammatory factors in all tested tissues. Further, we show that the critical master regulator of inflammatory genes expression NFκB may be involved in mediating the effects of the diets. The magnitude of the inflammatory gene expression regulation was comparable in the mucosa of the small intestine and colon as well as in Peyer’s patches.",f58eb2e2-c6be-4111-803a-17212d1b4f48
35,methods35," Whereas the response in the mesenteric lymph nodes was much milder, indicating the strong GI-tract-centered impact of the diets. Likely, the here-presented mechanisms contribute to preventing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gut inflammation, maladies for which therapeutic properties of restrictive diets have been reported in the past [6,9,13,14,15].  Previously, we showed that CR modulates the composition of intestinal and fecal bacteria [11,22]. Surprisingly, KD, which is similar to other restrictive diets in terms of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial gene and protein expression, showed the opposite impact on the abundance of several types of bacteria. The difference between KD and other restrictive diets confirms that the composition of consumed nutrients that further feed and breed bacteria is the main factor shaping gut bacteria [39].",05073ace-595d-4bec-81a8-b47f297443c1
36,methods36," It is also essential to consider that the beneficial impact of the diets may be partly bacteria-independent or rely on other bacteria whose abundance was not measured within this study.  The intestinal mucus layer is part of the innate mucosal intestinal barrier that reduces antigen and bacteria exposure to the epithelium, protecting and contributing to maintaining intestinal homeostasis [40]. Fasting changes mucus thickness already after 48 h [41]; interleukins tune goblet cells differentiation [42]; NFκB [43] and BAs [44] increase mucus production; while short chain fatty acids (SCFA)s stimulate mucus release [45]. Therefore, multiple factors assessed in this study impact the mucus layer. During food restriction, gut bacteria become dependent on mucin glycans for energy [46].",e1566047-962a-4de8-b485-06336f9f9851
37,methods37," Furthermore, the gut microbiota is fundamental for goblet cells’ differentiation, function, and the formation of a proper mucus layer [47], and Lactobacillus species are known as mucus production stimulators [48]. Correspondingly, the observed changes in Lactobacillus abundance corresponded to Muc13 gene expression. However, here-reported changes in mucus-related parameters under restrictive diet conditions are very modest in both the small intestine and colon.  Restrictive diets trigger a rise in the ratio of villi length to crypt depth, which likely aims at increasing surface area for nutrient absorption. It is a sound response to energy restriction; however, the strongest difference was observed for ad libitum consumed KD. Interestingly, ketone bodies signal to stem cells, altering differentiation and regeneration [49].",fa54a3e5-d86d-4c79-9a6a-30186f8a00af
38,methods38," Whereas medium-chain triglycerides, known for their ketogenic properties [50], are also applied to increase villi length and, therefore, enhance nutrient absorption and body weight gain [51].  Autophagy is induced to generate energy that supports metabolic processes and is often claimed to be one of the main benefits of fasting and caloric restriction [35]. At the same time, it is a key process required for a functional GI tract in terms of maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, anti-microbial defense, mucosal immune response [52], enteroendocrine cells’ function [53], mucin formation, and secretion by goblet cells [54]. Results of our study imply that restrictive diets stimulate autophagy in the GI tract, although the impact we measured is relatively mild.  Mitochondrial functionality and cellular energy metabolism are regulated by gut bacteria and are associated with cancer, celiac, and Crohn’s disease [55,56,57].",7e67bc90-76da-469d-b842-461aff37154e
39,methods39," KD has previously been shown to rescue inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in the rat intestine [58], increase mitochondria turnover [59] and mitochondrial protein acetylation [60]. Similarly, CR exhorts its beneficial effect on the intestine via mitochondria [61]. In our study, the KD and CR showed a tendency towards upregulation of mtDNA and TOMM20 in jejunum but did not impact the levels of Ucp2 and tended to reduce the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor Tfam in the colon, which may indicate changes in the mitochondrial turnover compared to its activity.",12344f55-f629-400e-8989-00f6d292cc76
40,methods40," Whereas several diets in our and previous studies [62] tend to increase the expression of Pgc1α, which is crucial for mitochondria function, the results may also be interpreted as contradictory, which fits well with confusion concerning the stimulatory role of CR in preserving mitochondrial function without increasing biogenesis [63] as well as enhancing mitochondria biogenesis [64] or stimulating mitoptosis [35]. Importantly, in the light of the complex interplay between mitochondrial function, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy versus mitochondria rejuvenation, as well as the number of mitochondria per cell versus mitochondrial activity, they all lack selective markers that allow distinguishing between these processes, which leads to a farfetched interpretation of the experimental results. Further, mitochondria function not only pertains to energy generation but also plays an essential role in apoptosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species.",9061c7e4-4da3-41d2-8527-b97cc4f67558
41,methods41," Therefore, based on our results, KD and CR may affect mitochondria in the intestinal epithelium; however, the nature and outcome of this regulation need further investigation.  For the here-presented experimental setup, the most commonly occurring versions of each diets were chosen. However, the length of the treatment, as well as the extent of restriction or nutrient composition varies strongly among different types of each diet applied in real-life and experimental settings. CR is experimentally applied within the range of 10–50% reduction in food intake. KD has multiple versions with various types and content of fat, which is vital to consider as, e.g., medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) exert greater anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory gut models and high fat diet-obese mice [65,66]. However, in the skin, the effect was the opposite [67]. Each diet can be applied for several days up to life-long.",5116d6c7-3704-4c4b-8cbd-ad5e7b95fb8a
42,methods42," Therefore, it is crucial to underline that the obtained results are specific to the selected experimental conditions. Future experiments exploring differences between subtypes of the diets may broaden the choice of applicable dietary conditions. Moreover, KD outcomes demonstrated that carbohydrate restriction has beneficial outcomes. However, previously, also protein restriction has been used as therapeutic means. This leads to a question of what other types of restrictions could have similar effects and why such a broad range of restrictions have a beneficial impact.  We conclude that despite drastic differences in the dietary protocols, the outcomes strongly align. Each of the diets is likely beneficial when applied as a drug-free approach to maintaining GI tract health. Notably, the beneficial impact of the diets can be achieved via KD without restricting energy intake, boosting hunger, or reducing basal metabolic rate, which often accompanies CR and IF.",d9e030fe-ba62-4d3c-ba6c-55618ce9b7b5
43,methods43," On the other hand, strict excision of carbohydrates may be more challenging to adhere to for some individuals than mild energy restriction, limiting eating window, or periodic fasting mimicking diet (FMD). Considering outcomes in the basic situation, it will be interesting to compare the diets in the context of inflammatory gut diseases. Finally, verification of the observed phenotype in a female model is necessary. ",bc7b793a-18b9-4ad5-9fc5-3f2c0e621f1f
