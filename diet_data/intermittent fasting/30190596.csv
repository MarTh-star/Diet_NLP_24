0,introduction0,"Intermittent fasting (IF) has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects through the activation of multiple signaling pathways. Rodents fasted intermittently exhibit enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis and long‐term potentiation (long‐term potentiation (LTP)) at hippocampal synapses compared with sedentary animals fed an ad libitum (AL) diet. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. In this study, we evaluated the mechanistic gap in understanding IF‐induced neurogenesis. ",c03d4108-2df6-47c2-b78b-2cc53608693c
1,methods0,"2.1 Animals and experimental design Male C57BL/6N mice were fed a normal chow diet comprised of a caloric basis of 58%, 24%, and 18% carbohydrate, protein, and fat, respectively, and were housed in the animal facilities at the National University of Singapore. During the entire experiment, the mice were housed in animal rooms at 20 to 22°C with 30%–40% relative humidity under a 12‐hr light/dark cycle. At 3 months of age, they were randomly assigned to ad libitum (AL), 12, 16, and 24‐hr diet groups. For 12 and 16‐hr groups, mice were fasted daily for either 12 hr (19:00–07:00) or 16 hr (15:00–07:00) for 3 months, whereas the 24‐hr group mice were fasted every other day for 3 months. The AL group was provided with food pellets ad libitum. The study was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  2.2 Immunoblot analysis The hippocampus tissue was isolated from the entire brain and collected for immunoblot analysis.",f2c9ec79-0307-4872-9deb-26129e36431b

However, there was no significant difference in average body weight between IF16 and every other day (EOD) mice. Our data also indicated that there was no significant difference in the overall energy intake across mice subjected to IF in comparison with AL mice (Data not shown). The adult brain is comprised of self‐renewing multipotent neural stem cells that are accountable for neurogenesis and plasticity in precise regions of the brain. Nestin, a marker for neuronal stem cells, is expressed as immature forms of both neuronal epithelial cells and progenitor cell types in the brain.",1bc3b585-4b49-47d7-9b69-a5382bbbd22c
5,results1," The present study demonstrated that intermittently fasted mice maintained for 3 months exhibited increased levels of NeuN in the hippocampus in comparison with the AL mice (Figure 1). Similarly, Nestin, a protein marker for precursor cells, followed the same trend as that of NeuN (Figure 1). These preliminary markers indeed show that there were increased levels of neurogenesis in the hippocampus in IF animals. In addition, we also found that there was a significant increase in the levels of PSD95 in the hippocampus of IF mice in comparison with AL mice (Figure 1). PSD95 is a major scaffolding protein in the excitatory postsynaptic density of neurons and is a potent regulator of synaptic strength. Elevated levels of PSD95 may indicate that IF not only leads to neurogenesis but also strengthens synaptic connections in the adult hippocampus.",c10466b2-8a08-4017-9122-8751436b0441

7,results3,"2 Intermittent fasting activates Notch signaling in the adult hippocampus The Notch signaling pathway has long been established to be essential in the maintenance of neural stem cells in the mammalian brain . Subsequent studies have established Notch 1 signaling to be essential in maintaining a reservoir of undifferentiated cells in order to ensure continuity of adult hippocampal neurogenesis . To test the hypothesis that IF may promote neurogenesis by activating the Notch signaling pathway, we investigated the main markers involved in the Notch 1 signaling pathway, especially the expression of full‐length Notch 1, Notch intracellular domain (NICD1), transcription factor HES5, and presenilin 1 (PS1). PS1 is known to have catalytic activity and is one of the subunits in the γ‐secretase complex that cleaves the transmembrane‐anchored cytoplasmic domain of Notch 1 to activate its downstream pathway (Arumugam et al.",f7cd5d07-ec23-4c33-9304-fcfea8d0405e
8,results4,", 2018; Cheng, Choi, Sobey, Arumugam, & Jo, 2015). Our data showed evidence that the Notch 1 signaling pathway was activated due to an upregulation of Notch 1, NICD1, and HES5 following IF (Figure 2). We also analyzed the expression level of Pin1 (Figure 2). Pin1 is a peptidyl‐isomerase that is well known to stabilize NICD1 by inhibiting ubiquitination . However, our data showed that IF did not alter the expression of Pin1. This may indicate that IF upregulates Notch 1 signaling independently of post‐translational modification.

The FFAs are metabolized in the liver to generate the ketones, acetone, acetoacetate (AcAc), and β‐hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and transported into the brain (Mattson, Moehl, Ghena, Schmaedick, & Cheng, 2018).",85e63926-4c79-4fdb-b4a9-fc5635c302b0
10,results6," This metabolic switching confers the brain to a neuroprotective state against injury and diseases through the activation of the brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) signaling pathway. At the presynaptic terminal, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is released into the intracellular space in response to the activation of glutamate receptors. This may be a stress response mechanism toward the fluctuation in energy metabolism during IF. brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also involved in the downstream activation of transcription factors that are involved in neurogenesis and energy balance, including cAMP response element‐binding protein (cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB)).",977c7368-63a7-4909-b082-3d6a93f07a67
11,results7," The transcription of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is in turn controlled by cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB), hence establishing a positive feedback loop between brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB). In addition, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) allows an increase in transcription of PSD95 to the cell surface membrane via the Trk pathway (Mattson et al., 2018; Yoshii & Constantine‐Paton, 2010). It was established that the Notch signaling pathway collaborates with the brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB) signaling pathways to allow differentiation of stem cells into mature neurons (Brai et al., 2015; He et al., 2019; Schölzke & Schwaninger, 2007).

15,results11,"1444 ==== Body 1 INTRODUCTION Dietary restriction (DR) is defined as a decrease in energy consumption without reducing nutritional value. This simple dietary intervention has been shown in a wide range of experimental animals to extend lifespan and decrease the incidence of several age‐related diseases. The definition of DR has been expanded from an alternative description of caloric restriction (CR) to also encompass a broader scope of interventions, including short‐term starvation, periodic fasting, fasting‐mimetic diets, and intermittent fasting (IF; Mattson & Arumugam, 2018). IF has been proven to be advantageous to various organ systems in the body and acts as a mild metabolic stressor. It has been postulated that IF is able to cause powerful changes in the metabolic pathways in the brain via an increase in stress resistance, and breakdown of ketogenic amino acids and fatty acids (Bruce‐Keller, Umberger, McFall, & Mattson, 1999; Kim et al., 2018).",f9121d8e-4f6f-443d-8200-2575b98178d4
16,results12," Experimental studies have also shown that IF is neuroprotective against acute brain injuries such as stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases (Arumugam et al., 2010; Halagappa et al., 2007; Manzanero et al., 2014). In addition, recent studies have also shown that IF can lead to an increase in neurogenesis levels in the hippocampus .  In the adult brain, the niches of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) are located specifically at the subventricular zone (subventricular zone (SVZ)) of the lateral ventricles, and in the subgranular zone (subgranular zone (SGZ)) of the hippocampus. The ability of NSCs to maintain cerebral neurogenesis is controlled by the tight regulation of balanced events commencing from stem cell maintenance, to stem cell division and proliferation, to its differentiation into mature neurons, and finally their survival and functional integration into the brain parenchyma (Lathia, Mattson, & Cheng, 2008; Lledo, Alonso, & Grubb, 2006).",130779e5-a509-4404-a4bb-ce61b369dd71
17,results13," The process of adult neurogenesis is highly regulated and is adaptable to environmental, morphological, and physiological cues, whereby cerebral performance is suited to function at optimal levels for a given environment. Studies have demonstrated that the proliferation of neural stem cells can be modified through metabolic perturbations experienced during high temperatures , physical activity , and a high‐fat diet (Kokoeva, Yin, & Flier, 2005). Experimental studies from our group have also shown that IF increases neurogenesis in the hippocampus as a form of neuroprotection following acute brain injury such as ischemic stroke. Moreover, we established that the number of BrdU‐labeled cells in the dentate gyrus of IF mice was elevated .",a9fbb713-bf04-4f70-9fcd-d02fb8781866
18,results14," To measure cell proliferation without the confound availability of an exogenous marker BrdU, we established increases in the number of Ki67‐labeled cells in the dentate gyrus of mice on the IF diet, indicating enhancement of cell proliferation in these mice . In addition to our findings, previous work similarly demonstrated that using the every other day (every other day (EOD)) IF regimen also increased BrdU‐labeled cell number in the hippocampus (Lee, Duan, & Mattson, 2002).  However, the molecular process involved in IF‐induced neurogenesis is not well understood. The Notch signaling pathway that is intricately involved in the determination of cell fate during brain development and adult neurogenesis may be a possible molecular process involved in IF‐induced neurogenesis .",8d9c9569-4332-4766-b7aa-d26c83e0012b
19,results15," In this study, we investigated the expression levels of molecular and cellular components of the hippocampal region, focusing specifically on Notch activation and associated proteins that are known to promote hippocampal neurogenesis such as brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) and cAMP response element‐binding protein (cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB)).  2 ",e8719ecd-9334-4a7f-8237-3b96d052a9fe
20,discussion0," Prophylactic IF has been shown to promote longevity as well as ameliorate the development and manifestation of age‐related diseases such as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases in many animal studies. It has also been postulated that IF is able to cause changes in the metabolic pathways in the brain, which leads to stress resistance capacity of brain cells . It was shown that protein chaperones (HSP‐70 and GRP‐78) and neurotrophic factors (brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and FGF2) were increased in brain cells in response to IF . In addition, IF was shown to increase hippocampal neurogenesis . The present study was to elucidate the impact of IF on key proteins that that regulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus.  In mammals, NSCs are located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) niches within the hippocampus, and are the basis for adult neurogenesis.",b6088522-7e5e-413d-9b07-c25a9ae20d71
21,discussion1," These cells are either in their dormant, active, or quiescent state. This makes the neurogenesis capacity highly regulated and controlled within the region (Yamashima, Tonchev, & Yukie, 2007). In the adult mouse brain, the Notch family are the gatekeeper for adult neurogenesis, specifically the interplay between Notch 1 and Notch 2 (Imayoshi & Kageyama, 2011). The maintenance of adult neurogenesis is a delicate mechanism that is highly dependent on proper external and internal biological stimuli, and hence raises an important question—whether these NSCs have any response to a hormesis mechanism such as IF through the Notch signaling pathway and how its mechanisms are demonstrated. Notch 1 is specifically involved in the regulation of postmitotic dendrite development in cortical neurons during adult neurogenesis (Ding, Gao, Ding, Fan, & Chen, 2016). In the dentate gyrus region, Notch 1 is expressed extensively and is important in synaptic plasticity of neurons.",c7fdb42f-dacc-4981-9a7f-020e1cd3e96b
22,discussion2," This was confirmed by studies that showed downregulation of Notch 1 in the hippocampus reduced synaptic plasticity of neurons in the brain . Moreover, Notch 1 deletion was shown to reduce the number of neural stem cells in the brain (Shih & Holland, 2006). Downstream of Notch signaling is HES5, one of NICD's target genes. HES5 plays an important role during mammalian development, where it is involved in the formation of neurospheres (Ohtsuka, Sakamoto, Guillemot, & Kageyama, 2001). Following neurodevelopment, in the adult stage, HES5 acts as a transcription factor that moves to the nucleus when activated, to increase the transcription of many target genes, including Nestin . Nestin is often involved in the proliferation of NSC population in the hippocampal region.",f582d551-671d-40b9-ac5b-ebc186479f33
23,discussion3," Our study demonstrates that Notch signaling and brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB) pathways may play a crucial role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis induced by IF, particularly by promoting Nestin expression, which is essential for stem cell proliferation (Figure 4).  Figure 4 Schematic diagram of intermittent fasting‐mediated pathways that induce adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

While all three IF regimens showed an increase in proteins that regulate hippocampal neurogenesis, only IF16 caused a significant increase in most of these protein expression. We have previously established that different IF regimen may induce differential metabolic switching processes, which may result in varying degrees of metabolic adaptation  and different effects on hippocampal neurogenesis.
