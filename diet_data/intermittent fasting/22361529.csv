0,introduction0,"Animals adjust their energy requirements when food is scarce or have a very high acquisition cost [1] and under metabolic stress, all the animals invest energy in survival rather than reproduction. Although the reproductive system is sensitive to change in energy status [1] but the physiological mechanisms explaining the link between energy balance and reproduction are not clearly understood. When food supply is insufficient to meet metabolic demands, puberty is delayed, and also ovulation and estrous cycle are suppressed [2], [3]. Food restriction has been known to exert negative influence on luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in prepubertal or cycling gilts [4], on ovarian development [5] and decrease in gonadotropin concentration in humans [6]. Both gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator system and gonadotropin secretion are inhibited by food restriction and the gonadotropin effect for folliculogenesis may not be sufficient [7], [8].",34b9aeb5-7dda-4247-9f5a-28e6e8b03f41
1,introduction1," Understanding the physiological basis of joint regulation of energy balance and reproductive function could help to design better strategies for maintaining reproductive health.  Circulating leptin plays a potential role in nutritional signaling to the brain and in the regulation of reproduction and energy balance with its primary target pathway in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus [9]. Leptin regulates a neuronal population mainly located at the arcuate, expressing either orexigenic (neuropeptides Y (NPY) and agouti related peptide, AgRP) and anorexigenic (proopiomelacortin, POMC and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript, CART) peptides [10]. Leptin alters the hypogonadotrophic state in lean animals by increasing POMC gene expression, and transport and acylation of melanocortins in the brain [11].",428b3dd4-7f56-438d-b95f-fdfd2c27a3c9
2,introduction2," Food restriction has been shown to modulate neuropeptides Y (NPY) gene expression during the phase of low leptin levels [12] and action of leptin on LH secretion is also dependent upon the availability of glucose [13]. Recent study shows that increase in hypothalamic neuropeptides Y (NPY) gene expression by caloric restriction might result from the coordinate action of several factors including the decrease in serum leptin and insulin concentration [14]. Few other reports showed that increase in neuropeptides Y (NPY) level may stimulate feeding behaviour and inhibit GnRH release during some periods of feeding cycle [15], [3].  Kisspeptin and neuropeptides Y (NPY) neurons are considered good candidates in linking pertuberations in energy balance with alterations in the activity of reproductive axis.",8646d2d6-8aab-46ff-a50e-3271547b1107
3,introduction3," neuropeptides Y (NPY), a potent orexigenic neuropeptide involved in the neuroendocrine control of reproductive axis, may metabolically regulate KISS-1 expression in the hypothalamus [16], [17]. Several reports suggest the role of KISS-1/kisspeptin/GPR54 system as a major gatekeeper of GnRH neurons and involved in metabolic control of reproductive axis [18], [19]. Short term fasting (72 h) in pubertal animals evoked a decrease in the expression of KISS-1 mRNA which was associated with reduction in circulating leutinizing hormone level in both the male and female rats [18].  Fluctuating physiological conditions reversibly alter the structural relationship among the neurons and glial cells in the hypothalamus and the functional pathways over which the information is transmitted to the neuroendocrine neurons [20], [21].

4,introduction4," PSA residues expressed on the extracellular domain of neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is known to have anti-adhesive role and intervenes in dynamic neuron-glia interactions [20], [22], [23]. Previous studies have revealed direct GnRH neuro-haemal contact on the day of proestrous [20], [24], whereas, astro-glial cells extend their processes towards the pericapillary space and block contact of GnRH terminals with perivascular space on diestrous day. Recently we have reported that removal of PSA from NCAM in vivo also blocked the retraction of glial processes and decreased GnRH neuron remodeling to secrete GnRH in perivascular space [25]. The co-localization of PSA-NCAM with GnRH in the external zone of median eminence (ME) in proestrous phase control rats suggest its permissive role in the regulation of GnRH release in perivascular space by allowing retraction of astro-glial processes.",daa4aee6-15e4-431c-8e0e-d8482ea3e710
5,introduction5,"  The current study was aimed to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may link energy status with reproduction in animals on IF-DR regimen for 12 weeks. 3–4 months old young adult rats of both the sexes were used for this study. After assessing the effect of IF-DR regimen on estrous cycle and serum level of estradiol and LH in female and testosterone and LH level in male animals, the study was further extended to explore the serum level of leptin hormone and hypothalamic expression of neuropeptides Y (NPY) and kisspeptin neuropeptides which are known to mediate nutritional signaling to regulate reproduction and energy balance at hypothalamic level. Previous studies from our lab and others have reported that GnRH axon terminals and associated glial cells in female rats undergo morphological remodeling to facilitate GnRH release near the perivascular space in median eminence during the proestrous phase of the reproductive cycle [24], [26], [27].",85ea4edd-f12f-434b-aa94-48a184495079
6,introduction6," To further investigate whether change in energy status due to IF-DR regimen negatively influence the reproductive function in rats at the level of these central regulatory mechanisms as well, we also explored the effect of IF-DR regimen on GnRH axon terminals remodeling in ME region of hypothalamus in both male and female rats alongwith the expression of plasticity markers such as PSA-NCAM and GFAP. To ascertain whether these changes are also regulated at post translational level, polysialyltransferase (polysialyltransferase (PST)), GnRH and GFAP mRNA expression was studied in IF-DR and ad libitum (AL) fed male and female rats. Although, several previous studies have focused on the influence of caloric as well as food restriction on gonadotropin secretion but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report to elucidate the negative impact of IF-DR regimen on reproduction at all levels of hypophysial gonadal (HPG) axis in young adult rats of both the sexes.",75ab0100-44fd-4318-b3b4-a113317c64b5

34,results14,"  Expression of GFAP in IF-DR and Proestrous Control Rats The astro-glial cells were seen to lose their star shaped structure which may be due to retraction of their processes surrounding GnRH axon terminals.

The present data showed extended processes of astro-glial cells surrounding the GnRH axon terminals in ME region of IF-DR female (Fig. 4D) and male rats (Fig. 5D). GnRH axons were co-distributed with the glial elements in both internal and external zone of ME in the IF-DR female and male rats (Fig. 4F and 5F), whereas, GFAP expression was highly reduced and restricted mainly to the internal zone of ME region in control rats (Fig. 4E and 5E).

41,discussion0,"Feeding regimen of intermittent fasting-dietary restriction of three months duration reduced body weight and blood glucose level in both young (3–4 months) male and female Wistar strain rats and resulted in 19% and 34% loss in body weight in female and male rats, respectively. On the other hand, IF-DR regimen adversely affected the reproductive function as evident from disrupted estrous cycle and reduced ovarian weight observed in IF-DR female rats as compared to AL fed control animals, which showed normal estrous cyclicity. Estrous cycle was disturbed after about two weeks of initiation of alternate day feeding in female rats. The data further revealed that IF-DR regimen markedly enhanced serum estradiol in female rats and reduced testosterone level in male rats, whereas, serum LH concentration was found to drastically decrease in animals of both the sexes on IF-DR regimen.",26bd3cc6-cf7e-4ecb-ac6e-fb3f091e8358
42,discussion1," The current data suggests that IF-DR regimen adversely affects reproduction in young adult rats by disrupting estrous cycle in female rats as well as altering serum concentration of estradiol, testosterone and LH in both male and female animals. These results are supported by recent studies reporting significant reduction in body weight of ewes on food restriction and irregular and completely disrupted estrous cycle which were observed in 20% to 40% caloric restricted rats [32]–[34]. Similar studies in bull reported that low nutrition levels during calfhood adversely affected LH secretion and impaired testicular steroidogenesis as well as inhibited GnRH pulse generator and delayed puberty [7], [8]. Decrease in body weight and body mass index has also been reported in the anorexia nervosa patients as compared to control subjects [35]. Moreover meal related insulin secretion is altered in human subjects with anorexia [36].",03cf521f-f211-4193-a6d4-fba17587eb3c
43,discussion2,"  Further, we observed sex-based difference in animals responding to IF-DR regimen as the reproductive alterations were more pronounced in IF-DR females as compared to their male counterparts. The heterogeneous hormonal response has also been observed in the patients with restrictive anorexia nervosa [37]. Several abnormalities have been reported in anorexia patients such as low T3 syndrome; decreased levels of free T4, IGF-I [38], and free testosterone [39]. Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) expressing inter-neurons have been shown to mediate estrogen feedback to GnRH neurons [40]. Estrogen exerts negative feedback effect by reduced serum LH through estrogen response element independent of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) signaling pathway [41]. Exogenous treatment of estradiol in sows and gilts is known to decrease hypothalamic GnRH, pulse amplitude and frequency of LH release [42].",d55abfcc-5313-4d80-8ffc-3b9e61bcd81b
44,discussion3," These findings support the current data suggesting that increase in estradiol level in IF-DR female rats may lead to down regulation of GnRH and LH level via negative feedback. The reduced gonadotropin secretion may be due to the inhibitory effect of estrogen at the pituitary level and androgens at the hypothalamic level. Estrogens in the ingested food and anabolic steroids used by some athletes and body builders also show similar effect [43]. Significant decrease in mean plasma LH and testosterone pulse frequency has been reported in men after 48 h fasting period [44].  The energy status of an animal, depending on its dietary regimen/intake is known to regulate diverse physiological functions as well as alter estradiol and testosterone levels in males and females [45].",565b24d9-a1a8-43e2-8f5f-c83adae654c3
45,discussion4," The relationship between dietary intake and reproductive capacity seems to be especially vulnerable to energy status in the female as is evident from disruption of estrous cyclicity within few days of initiation of the IF-DR regimen in the current investigation. A recent study suggests that reproduction involves higher energy expenditure in female animals as compared to male animals [46]. Moreover, the physiological functions of females such as pregnancy and lactation also demand considerable energy to nurture the embryos and newborns [47]. Several recent studies also support the probability of altered reproductive function and reduced LH pulse frequency during negative energy balance [1], [7]. The decreased serum testosterone level in IF-DR male rats may be responsible for reduced GnRH synthesis/secretion.",c8bb9a75-7f03-4a3c-a911-c39b2897cd0c
46,discussion5, The current data further strengthens the physiological basis of proposed link between nutritional/energy status and reproduction and their relationship that involves multiple regulatory molecules signaling at different levels of the reproductive axis.  The present study further elucidates alteration in the levels of metabolic fuel detectors/regulators such as leptin and hypothalamic ME-ARC region expression of neuropeptides Y (NPY) and kisspeptin. We observed significant reduction in serum leptin level in IF-DR rats of both the sexes. The decrease observed in the blood glucose level in rats on IF-DR regimen (with females showing more pronounced percentage reduction) may link these fuel detector’s function to inhibit the expression of GnRH and serum LH concentration.,4efff655-8828-4754-87d7-4faef28d3662
47,discussion6," Welt et al [48] reported that treatment of leptin in leptin deficient subjects and undernutrition women with hypothalamic amenorrhea induced increased gonadotropins, LH and estradiol level, ovarian volume and the number of dominant follicles. Recent findings suggest that hypoleptinaemia is the critical signal responsible for inhibition of ARC Kiss-1 and LH during negative energy state [49]. Moreover, plasma concentration of leptin and insulin were reduced in food restricted OVX ewes for 4 months [50]. In the current study, animals of both the sexes on IF-DR regimen showed increase in neuropeptides Y (NPY)-ir and its mRNA expression, whereas, serum leptin level and hypothalamic kisspeptin expression were down regulated. The leptin receptor mRNA is co-expressed with kisspeptin and neuropeptides Y (NPY) in the arcuate region of hypothalamus and the administration of leptin is known to reduce neuropeptides Y (NPY) and upregulates kisspeptin expression [3].",8cef46ee-d91c-485a-ab86-a629fbbcbe46
48,discussion7, neuropeptides Y (NPY) up regulation observed during IF-DR regimen may be due to reduced serum leptin level as it has been reported to act as a metabolic signal to regulate neuropeptides Y (NPY) expression [36]. Previous studies have also revealed that leptin treatment upregulates kisspeptin mRNA expression in mouse hypothalamic cell line [17]. The presence of leptin receptor on kisspeptin neurons of arcuate region also demonstrate that these cells respond to peripheral leptin level [11]. These findings support our observations that the reduced circulating leptin level in IF-DR animals may be responsible for down regulating kisspeptin and enhancing neuropeptides Y (NPY) expression in arcuate nucleus and thus link the energy status through these metabolic sensors in hypothalamus.,4606cb5e-ffe9-4b1f-8982-cee9af6bec74
49,discussion8,"  neuropeptides Y (NPY) fibres make synapse with the dendrites and cell bodies of GnRH neurons in preoptic area and GnRH neuron terminals in ME region of hypothalamus [51], thus suggesting that neuropeptides Y (NPY) may be acting as a link between energy status and GnRH pulse generator. A recent finding also reported that caloric restriction up regulated neuropeptides Y (NPY) expression in hypothalamus [35]. The current and previous findings suggest that increased neuropeptides Y (NPY) expression in animals on dietary/caloric restriction may inhibit the release of GnRH from median eminence and thus affecting the hypophysial gonadal (HPG) axis [52], [53]. These observations may also explain the basis of infertility resulting from restricted food intake by women under conditions such as anorexia nervosa and exercise-induced amenorrhea. We further observed down regulation in kisspeptin-ir and its mRNA expression in IF-DR male and female rats.",5c59a5c6-a879-435b-a8c3-8f0513116259
50,discussion9," Kisspeptin is reported earlier to act on hypophysial gonadal (HPG) axis by stimulating GnRH neurons thus inducing its secretion [54] and reported reduction in KISS-1 mRNA expression after fasting [17], [55]. Kisspeptin has distinct action on GnRH release, mediating the negative feedback of sex steroids on GnRH secretion via neurons in the arcuate region of hypothalamus and positive feedback of sex steroids via anteroventral paraventricular thalamic (anteroventral paraventricular thalamic (AVPV)) neurons [19] and promotes GnRH secretion via G-Protein coupled receptor (GPR-54) [56]. Mutation in GPR-54 receptor causes hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism in rodents and humans [57]. Both fasting and lactation have been reported to reduce KISS-1 and GPR54 mRNA expression [17].",7ef27905-ad5a-4c95-a2b8-4a5e64980761
51,discussion10,"  The present study further investigated the effect of IF-DR regimen on the morphological remodeling of GnRH neuron terminals in the ME region of hypothalamus as our lab has earlier reported that GnRH axon terminals near perivascular space are known to undergo remodeling in order to facilitate release of neurohormone in hypophysial portal circulation [20], [58]. Animals on IF-DR paradigm showed decrease in expression of GnRH and PSA-NCAM in ME region of hypothalamus in both male and female rats which recovered to near control levels in DR-R female animals. Further the astro-glial cells showing expression of GFAP were also seen to extend their processes between GnRH axon terminals in the outer zone of ME region in rats on IF-DR regimen.",d21b7f30-7fa5-4b8d-baac-88c86ecbe68d
52,discussion11," These findings are supported by recent reports from our lab and confirm the functional role of PSA-NCAM in dynamic remodeling of astro-glial processes and GnRH axon terminals near perivascular space to facilitate the release of GnRH in the hypophysial portal system during proestrous phase of reproductive cycle [20], [26], [59].  In conclusion, the data shown in table 2 may help to understand how the individual factors such as metabolic fuel, sex hormones, leptin, neuropeptides Y (NPY) and kisspeptin act as neuroendocrine regulators to link reproductive dysfunction to the perturbations in energy balance. Changes in the expression level of these molecules adversely affected GnRH expression and its release from the ME region of hypothalamus in both the male and female rats on IF-DR regimen, thus supporting the proposed hypothesis of a central link between reproduction and energy status [3], [60].",e76a4243-2668-4d4a-968f-7347f0391f77
53,discussion12," It may be suggested that the reduced leptin levels in IF-DR animals conveys the nutritional signal to arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus through the metabolic sensors such as neuropeptides Y (NPY) and kisspeptin, and further the alterations observed in their expression may be important factors in disrupting the function of hypophysial gonadal (HPG) axis in response to negative energy balance. Moreover, the current results suggests that the GnRH neurons which occupy a master position in hypophysial gonadal (HPG) axis, become target of many central and peripheral origin metabolic regulators directly or indirectly thus compromising reproductive functions in the face of energy status. The current data may help to understand the clinical basis of nutritional infertility observed in patients of anorexia nervosa and hypothalamic amenorrhea due to metabolic stress, excessive exercise, undernutrition etc.  10.1371/journal.pone.0052416.",586caaea-4b05-4b28-bad9-e0dd27fb98d2
