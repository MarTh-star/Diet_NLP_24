0,introduction0," Fasting has been practiced for centuries not only to fulfill religious obligations, but also as therapy and lifestyle (1). Ramadan fasting (RF) is one type of diurnal intermittent fasting that is performed by millions of Muslims worldwide. RF is performed from dawn to sunset for 29–30 days. Due to geographical differences, the time periods of RF vary from 9 to 22 h per day (2). In this study, RF was performed for 17–18 h/day. During RF, food, water, smoking, and sexual activities are forbidden, but not after breaking the fast (3). Travelers, the unwell, elderly, children, and pregnant and nursing people are exempt from RF (4).  Several studies have reported benefits of RF in healthy individuals (1, 5) and patients (6–9). Benefits of fasting were reported in different patient groups, including in diabetic (6, 7, 10), asthma (11), and allergic patients (11).",73364364-4563-4cd0-ba58-2ae86d0d5877
1,introduction1," In healthy men and women, the benefits of RF have been shown, such as improvement of body composition parameters, mood, fatigue, and health-related quality of life (1, 5).  Since the last decade, previous studies have reported the benefits of RF and aimed to show how such improvements are mediated by various biological factors. Fasting, in general, modifies immune systems and improves the symptoms of chronic inflammatory diseases (12). It can be mediated by monocyte metabolic activity and several cytokines (12, 13). However, the results concerning inflammatory markers are still inconclusive (13–15). A previous study elucidated the effects of RF on diabetic-related parameters, such as glucometabolic markers (16). Our previous study showed no differences with regard to the level of creatinine, as a biological marker for kidney, between fasting and non-fasting groups, although RF was conducted for about 19 h (17).",8ed219bd-6567-4584-bc00-587bb1868cbd
2,introduction2,"  Our previous studies reported the benefit of RF in health-related quality of life and mood-related symptoms (1, 5). Furthermore, its benefit could still be observed up to 1 month after finishing RF (1). Therefore, it would be of interest to elucidate the biological mechanism related to mood-related symptoms.  Cortisol is a glucocorticoid class of hormone that is produced in the adrenal cortex (18, 19). Its release occurs in a circadian rhythm based on the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA)) as well as in stressful situations and during physical work (19). High cortisol levels are associated with stress-related disorders (18, 19). During fasting, the levels of cortisol alter. Alterations differ based on measurement time (20, 21). With regard to RF, there is a lack of information on how cortisol is altered during RF, particularly when fasting is performed in the summer time for about 17 to 18 h daily.",6dd95217-2202-4254-9aba-1579d233e13c
3,introduction3," Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) is one of the neurotrophins that has been studied in mental-related disorders (22–25), cognition (26), physical activity, and nutrition (27, 28). Furthermore, a lower level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the peripheral nervous system is associated with impairment of cognitive performance and higher body weight (26, 29). Therefore, this study aimed to determine cortisol and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in serum samples during RF and their association with mood and health-related quality of life.  Additionally, other biological mediators associated with nutritional intake, body composition parameters, and mood such as insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), myoglobin, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9) were also determined. IGF-1 also plays a role in mood and body composition (30, 31).",0ec22a11-78c7-4be1-aba2-a55fa313c614
4,introduction4," IL-8, as one of the inflammatory markers, has been known to be associated with mood and nutritional intake (32, 33). The increase of IL-8 is correlated with positive mood (33). matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is correlated with obesity (34, 35) and muscle strength (36). Meanwhile, myoglobin has been known to be responsible for intramuscular oxygen transport (37) and can be used to measure the muscle breakdown in the body (38), as our previous studies showed a decrease in skeletal muscle mass during RF (1, 5).

The data were analyzed by using either Kruskal-Wallis or two-way Friedman ranked test. The post hoc tests were performed, and significances were adjusted by using Bonferroni correction. Spearman's correlation tests were performed to determine correlation between clinical parameters and biological mediators. Missing data were replaced by using a mean imputation method. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to determine the distribution of the data. Significance was set at p < 0.05. SPSS 26 (IBM, New York City, NY, USA) was used to analyze the data.

Next, a significantly lower level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was observed from the last days of RF (T3) to T1 (Figure 2B). Furthermore, chemokine IL-8 level was increased at T2 compared to T1, T3, T4, and T5 (Figure 2C).

Biological Parameters in Male and Female Participants  Figure 3 demonstrates different types of gender based-biological markers (men and women) during RF at different time points. Interestingly, there was a significant reduction of cortisol level from T1 to T2 in comparison to T4 in male participants, but not in female participants (Figure 3A).

Correlations Between Biological Mediators and Clinical Parameters During RF  Table 3 shows the correlations between biological mediators and clinical parameters in all, male, and female participants. At T3, in all participants, IGF-1 and IL-8 levels showed positive correlations with body composition-related parameters. Cortisol showed a negative correlation with BW.

Additionally, other biological mediators including IGF-1, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and myoglobin were also studied. The RF was performed for 17–18 h/day for 1 month.  Cortisol  Cortisol has been known to be associated with mental health-related problems (18, 30, 39, 40) and regulated by circadian rhythms (30). In healthy subjects, cortisol also plays a role in regard to physical activity, nutrition changes, and mood symptoms (24, 31). In this study, the level of cortisol decreased, particularly at T3 and T4 in all participants. However, the decrease at both time points could only be observed in male participants.",7749b88a-0097-4488-83ec-f10970ef4874

This study is in agreement with Bahijri et al. who showed the decrease of cortisol level after RF (32), but contradicts that of Al Rawi et al. (33). The difference could be explained by the fact that the latter study determined cortisol level in overweight and obese participants, whereas in this current study, the body mass index (BMI) of participants was in the normal range (1). In this study, the difference of cortisol level only occurred in male participants. This could be attributed to the fact that men and women manage stress differently (34). This result is in agreement with the mood level of men that has been reported in previous studies (1, 5). Interestingly, cortisol level is also significantly correlated with body composition parameters.",66d5ddec-9c25-4484-896c-38deeedc1f17
21,discussion2," These results are supported by several other studies that showed that cortisol played a role in body composition parameters (30, 39, 40).  brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)  brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the second neurotrophin that has been mostly determined in association with mood (17), stress-related disorders (35), nutrition (28), and chronic pain (22–24). RF has been reported to be associated with mood and alteration of nutritional intake. In this study, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level of all participants tended to decrease until the last day of RF (T3) and it returned to baseline value (T1) at 1 month after RF (T5). The difference was particularly observed in male participants when compared at T1 and T3.",2a9c519e-bfd2-484d-833c-ac778451bb54
22,discussion3," This result cannot be directly compared with another study that did not show significant alterations, due to differing experimental time points (31); the latter study only observed brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level at day 3 of an intermittent fasting period. In another study, the result of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level was conflicting at T2 and T3 (17). It seems that gender could play a role in regard to this difference (36). Other reasons may include differences in body composition (1) and hormonal status (36). A significant correlation of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with body composition parameters and mood supports the role of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mediating RF-derived health-related benefits and improvements (24, 27, 28).  IL-8  IL-8 is an inflammatory mediator, which is produced in different types of tissue (37). IL-8 has also been known to be associated with mood and nutritional intake (38, 41).",14595e9d-7a51-4e63-b67f-8d8e1ab26b15
23,discussion4," In this study, the level of IL-8, particularly compared to T2, was gradually decreasing until T5. This result is different from other studies (14, 15). In one study, there was no significant alteration of IL-8 (14). Meanwhile, in another study, significant alterations were observed (15). However, in the latter study, if we check at a specific time point (morning time: 0600), there was no significant difference. The discrepancies of results with the latter study (15) could be that sleep/wake pattern, meal composition, and energy expenditure were controlled. In this study, we did not control such parameters, as we preferred to observe free-living participants. In this study, significant changes of IL-8 occurred only when comparing T2 and T5; and T1 and T2 in male and female participants, respectively. Interestingly, IL-8 was significantly correlated with body composition-related parameters. This study was in agreement with other study by Razmjou et al.",1c78ebd1-65a3-49c5-a857-c58f6bfb6d5d
24,discussion5," (42), but contradicted another study by Ghashang et al. that did not show any correlation with body composition-related parameters (14). The reason could be that the latter study only included male participants.  IGF-1  IGF-1 is an important hormone, particularly in regulation of the pituitary growth hormone (43, 44). IGF-1 also plays a role in different clinical-related issues, such as mood and body composition (45, 46). In our study, the level of IGF-1 increased at T2 which then stabilized until 1 week after RF if we compare with before RF (T1). These data did not support other studies that showed a decrease of IGF-1 (47, 48). The differences could be the characteristics of the participants: one study observed the effect of RF on IGF-1 in overweight and obese participants, and another study only observed male participants. In our study, we had both male and female participants with normal body mass index (BMI) (1). These two studies only reported in two time points.",354770dc-18ab-4c1c-b140-ce8d5fe020a0
25,discussion6," Meanwhile, in our study, the measurements were performed at five different time points. In this study, the correlation of IGF-1 and body composition parameters were particularly observed at T3 (all participants and men) and T4 (in only men). This is in agreement with other studies that reported a correlation between IGF-1 and body composition parameters (46). These results support the role of IGF-1 in mediating RF-derived improvements in regard to body composition parameters (46).  matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9  matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is involved in different types of pathological remodeling including inflammatory mechanism, cardiovascular disease (49), and oncologic processes (50). It is known that fasting is recommended as a complementary therapy for cancer patients (51). In this study, the decrease of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was observed until T5.",40abd63c-259e-4ec7-8f81-4dda5f2d84b5
26,discussion7," Unfortunately, there was no comparison study available in regard to matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, except one that measured matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 from the ocular surface (52). Furthermore, it seems the benefit of fasting in different diseases could be mediated by the decrease of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. As in different type of diseases, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was higher (e.g., in colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory bowel diseases) (50). In this study, correlation between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and body composition parameters occurred, particularly with body composition parameters (body fat percentage (BFP) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM). This interesting finding was supported by a previous study that reported a negative correlation between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and obesity (53, 54) and muscle strength (55).",ec1067c2-a99e-4a08-846b-d97194deaacd
27,discussion8,"  Myoglobin  Myoglobin is a muscle protein that is located in the cytoplasm of the heart and skeletal muscles and is responsible for intramuscular oxygen transport (56). Some studies showed that myoglobin can be used to measure the muscle breakdown in the body (57). Our previous studies showed a decrease of skeletal muscle mass (1, 5). Therefore, in this study, myoglobin was determined. Myoglobin was determined only at T1 (one week before RF) and T3 (last days of RF) as it was the most interesting time point that might lead to the highest effect during RF in regard to the decrease of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) (1, 5). Interestingly, the level of myoglobin significantly decreased from T1 to T3. However, there was no correlation between myoglobin and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) at all time points. It seems the decrease of myoglobin at T3 was due to the decreased level of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) in the body. Therefore, the body would need less myoglobin.",50467bd7-225f-4f8b-b553-6a71d6d5bef3
28,discussion9," However, further studies are needed for this to be elucidated and other studies should also be performed in different time points.  Effect Size  The effect sizes of these biological parameters were determined to observe the magnitude alterations due to RF. Based on effect size calculations, it seems all determined biological parameters played a role in bringing benefits of RF on body composition parameters, mood, and QoL, as almost all parameters showed large effect sizes, either at T3, T4, and T5. These results were in line with the effect size of RF on mood and body composition parameters in our previous study (1).  Limitation  This study has some limitations. As mentioned above, all of these parameters were influenced not only by fasting, but also physical activities and nutrition intake. In this study, we also did not record the number of participants who skipped predawn breakfast and their sleeping pattern, which could also influence all the parameters.",a4c9f747-b713-409d-ab79-3b7882fa63d1
29,discussion10," Therefore, further studies need to consider recording these parameters. This study was participated by young participants (mostly students in the Hannover area), which could influence the level of cortisol and other biological parameters. Future studies should be considered to include participants with a broader range of ages. This study was only performed in the fasting group. Future studies to compare fasting groups and non-fasting groups would also be of interest.  Strengths  Some strong points of this study include the determination of RF in both male and female participants. Many RF studies only reported pre/during and post RF (9, 48, 58). However, this study determined the effect of RF in the mid of RF (T2); and extended the determination until 1 week (T4) and 1 month after RF (T5), in order to determine the longer effect of RF.",cde46df2-df2b-44eb-83fc-721c5114c70e
30,discussion11," Many RF studies have been conducted particularly at equatorial, subequatorial, and tropical zones which mostly perform RF between 13 to 16 h/day every year (9, 13, 33, 47, 58, 59). This study was performed in the northern part of the globe (Germany—temperate zones). In this zone, during summer, RF is performed longer than those aforementioned zones.  Implications of the Findings and Future Directions  The results of this study show that a prolonged duration of fasting (17 to 18 h/day) could still be tolerated and even show benefits for both physical and mental health in young and healthy participants. The benefits might be mediated by different biological mediators. Religious fasting, particularly RF, has been a concern of both patients and health professionals.",338289ad-d387-42ad-9b77-9089d62ec6b6
31,discussion12," Therefore, future studies with similar duration (17–18 h/day or even longer) of fasting should also be performed in different health conditions in order to give the best recommendations for patients who live in the temperate zone.  Conclusions  The benefits of RF include improvement of mood and body composition-related parameters. The benefit of RF in mood and body composition-related parameters might be mediated by different biological mediators, particularly cortisol and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
