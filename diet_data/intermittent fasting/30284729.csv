0,introduction0,"Recently, great interest had been developed on the effect of intermittent fasting on cadriometabolic risk, particularly, diurnal intermittent fasting (diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF)) [1]. diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) is practiced by hundreds of millions of Muslims during the month of Ramadan [2]. The effects of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) on human health have attracted the attention of investigators in the past few years. diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) is not similar to caloric restriction (CR), in which caloric intake is reduced for long periods, but meal frequency is preserved [2]. During Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF), fast performers abstain from food, drinks, and smoking from dawn to sunset for a period of one month. diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) during Ramadan fasting can be looked at as a time-restricted feeding (between dawn and sunset) protocol with no calorie restriction.",aa02349f-0bb6-4a48-9f8f-3adfb8e3164a
1,introduction1," Traditionally, 2 main meals are taken at night during Ramadan; the first after sunset and the second before dawn, where performers usually obtain adequate sleep at night before the pre-dawn meal [3]. This practice has a religious dimension that aims to motivate performers to rise early, before dawn, for the pre-dawn meal and dawn prayer. However, recent studies have shown that Ramadan month is associated with several lifestyle changes that might influence the health of fast performers, such as changes in sleep/wake schedule, reduced nocturnal sleep duration, reduced physical activity, increased caloric intake, and changes in meal contents [2]. Therefore, data from studies assessing the health effects of CR or other types of fasting cannot be extrapolated to the Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) [1].  Cytokines are small glycoproteins produced by several cell types, especially white blood cells, which regulate immunity and response to inflammation.",e62ad225-8939-468a-80a0-7caeaf1535af
2,introduction2," Their persistent elevation has negative effects on various organs and bodily functions, such as increasing the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases [4]. Studies in animal models have shown that low-calorie intake reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines [5]. A few studies have examined inflammatory biomarkers during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF). A recent meta-analysis of 10 studies conducted on diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) performers during Ramadan demonstrated a small reduction in inflammatory biomarkers during fasting [6].  However, previous studies collected only a single morning blood sample for evaluation of proinflammatory cytokine levels.",284c0b3d-886f-4102-ac6f-88728511256e
3,introduction3," Additionally, previous studies that measured proinflammatory cytokines during diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) were performed without controlling for lifestyle changes that might affect the measured biomarkers, such as caloric intake [7], sleep duration [8], changes in the biologic clock [9], circadian variation of the levels of biomarkers [10], and energy expenditure [11]. Therefore, the obtained results might be influenced by these factors and not reflect the pure effect of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF). In order to assess the effects of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) during Ramadan on proinflammatory cytokine levels, an experimental design that has good control of the associated lifestyle changes is mandatory.  To account for the variation in the levels of the biomarkers with the biological clock, plasma levels of cytokines were measured at 22:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, and 11:00 [10, 12, 13].",3822a97b-2b96-4a9f-bc6d-c5214cccbf01
4,introduction4," Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and Il-8 are major components of low-grade systemic inflammation and are important proinflammatory cytokines that predispose the development of cardiometabolic diseases [14]. IL-1β is a central mediator of inflammatory responses, involved in a range of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [15]. IL-6 is secreted by T-lymphocytes and macrophages and has a role in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity [16]. IL-8 is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces chemotaxis in target cells, mainly neutrophils and other granulocytes [17, 18].  Based on the above, we hypothesized that diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) reduces proinflammatory cytokine levels.",4e2f2bb4-e464-441c-a934-c22bd7f7a769
5,introduction5," Therefore, this study was designed to assess the effect of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) during and outside of the month of Ramadan on plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 while controlling for the sleep/wake pattern, sleep length and quality, meal composition, energy consumption, and light exposure. diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) outside of the month of Ramadan was performed to evaluate the effect of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) on plasma levels of cytokines in the absence of the lifestyle changes accompanying Ramadan. This study allowed the investigaotrs to assess the effects of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) on proinflammatory cytokine levels. ",ba162fe6-d093-48ab-ac82-9913e26b9088

This fasting week was ended 3 weeks before Ramadan to ensure an adequate wash-out period and to avoid any carryover effects.  The last week of month number 8 (Shaban): During the last 3 weeks of the month of Shaban, participants were not fasting. This period was termed “non-fasting baseline (BL).” Participants were admitted to the laboratory for approximately 24 h for monitoring between days 21 and 28 of the month.  After completing 2 weeks of Ramadan (month 9, Hijri): Participants performed diurnal fasting (from dawn to sunset) during the first 2 weeks of Ramadan.

11,methods5,"  Protocol in the laboratory • Fasting and meal-timings protocol  During their stay in the laboratory, participants performed fasting from dawn to sunset. During non-fasting BL, participants received 3 meals; dinner at 20:30, breakfast at 07:15, and lunch at 12:00 (mid-day). During fasting protocol was labeled as “Fasting outside Ramadan” (FOR) and Ramadan, a light meal was served at sunset to break the fast, followed by a dinner meal at 21:00 and a pre-dawn (Suhur) meal 30 min before dawn time. During the study period, sunset and dawn times ranged from 18:23–18:35 and 04:02–03:35, respectively. A fixed caloric intake (35 Kcal/kg/24 h) and a fixed proportion of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates were served.  • Light intensity in the laboratory  From 18:00 until bedtime, the light level was maintained at 50 lux. During the pre-dawn meal, the light was kept < 30 lux [24].",699cc38a-2d10-46b1-9518-d6e477fddeef
12,methods6," From bedtime until rising time (polysomnography (PSG) recording), all lights were switched off and light intensity was maintained at < 1 lux. Light intensity was determined using a Spectral Star Light Meter LX-1 (Japan).  • Energy expenditure in the laboratory  Energy expenditure in the laboratory was monitored using the SenseWear Pro Armband™ (Body Media, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The armband is a portable device worn around the right arm.  The device has sensors that continuously measure skin temperature, galvanic skin response, heat flux, and movements and uses a validated advanced algorithm to estimate total energy expenditure [25, 26].  • Sleep monitoring in the laboratory  Participants were instructed to avoid napping during the day of admission to the laboratory. During non-fasting BL, bedtime was at 23:00 and rise time at 07:00.

During fasting protocol was labeled as “Fasting outside Ramadan” (FOR), participants were awakened at 03:45 for the pre-dawn meal (to account for the shift in dawn time), and participants resumed sleep from 04:30 until 07:45.  Sleep monitoring was performed using Alice 6 diagnostic equipment (Philips/Respironics, Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA). The following parameters were reported in the results: sleep efficiency (the percentage of time spent asleep while in bed); arousal index, which is a measure of sleep disruption reporting on the number of arousals per hour of sleep; and “stage shifts,” which reports on the number of changes in sleep stages from lights out to lights on. Scoring was performed according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine scoring criteria [27].",fee102a5-7a69-4a42-a914-7fd69a04f5f6

Moreover, currently available data have suggested that mealtime and meal composition might affect the levels of the measured inflammatory markers [31, 32]. For example, it has been shown in mice that postprandial IL-1β levels increase in response to a meal [33]. Similar findings have been demonstrated in humans, where an increase in plasma IL-1β levels after intake of a high fat content meal was reported [34]. Therefore, collecting a single sample in the early morning after a heavy pre-dawn meal may influence the levels of the measured markers.",4c1a316d-0ca4-45a6-94de-1a051399dac5
29,discussion3," Additionally, shifting mealtimes to the night during diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) might have an effect on the biologic clock of the body and its physiological responses [1], and hence may affect the rhythmicity of the inflammatory biomarkers. To overcome this, taking several blood samples around the clock would be the most efficient way to assess the effects of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) on the levels of serum cytokines. Additionally, all previous studies did not control for factors shown to affect the levels of the measured biomarkers, such as caloric intake [7], sleep duration [8], and energy expenditure [11].  Studies that assessed circadian rhythm and biological clock markers during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) without controlling for the above mentioned lifestyle changes that accompany Ramadan, demonstrated a shift delay in the body circadian rhythm [2].",d5206808-7c9c-4594-af5f-2594a996a45b
30,discussion4," Recent well-designed studies revealed that the body internal circadian clock influences the levels of cytokines [12]. Moreover, cytokines in human blood have been shown to display circadian rhythms. Therefore, diurnal rhythmicity of cytokine secretion has important implications for the timing of blood samples collection. Previous studies that assessed cytokine levels during diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) did not account for possible changes in the biologic clock of volunteers and did not assess the effects of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) on the circadian pattern of cytokines. In the present study, we controlled for light exposure, as well as bedtime and rise time to avoid changes in the circadian clock of participants. Using the same protocol, we have previously demonstrated that there is no change in the circadian rhythm of melatonin [35].",787448e6-453d-41ee-8716-7190f5228494
31,discussion5," Additionally, we used a cosinor model to assess the effect of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) on the circadian pattern of the measured cytokines. The present study demonstrated no significant changes in the circadian phase (acrophase) of the measured cytokines during diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF). However, the amplitude of IL-6 was significantly lower during Ramadan compared to BL, which reflects a more reduction the circadian oscillation of IL-6 after 2 weeks of fasting compared to the reduction after 1 week of fasting (fasting protocol was labeled as “Fasting outside Ramadan” (FOR) period). This reduction in the amplitude of IL-6 rhythmicity may suggest that, at least in part, longer fasting might have a sustained inhibitory effect on inflammation [36]. Further studies are needed to support this hypothesis.  Weight loss has been proposed as a mechanism for the reduction of proinflammatory cytokine levels during diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) [37].",d9991831-fdc1-4875-86c6-b5f8302aa33a
32,discussion6," Therefore, it is important to monitor weight when assessing the impact of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) on proinflammatory cytokine levels, as weight changes can be a major confounder affecting cytokine levels [38, 39]. In the present study, we enlisted volunteers with normal body mass index (BMI) and monitored their weight during the study period. Hence, weight loss could not be the sole mechanism explaining the reduction of cytokine levels. Additionally, both animal and human studies have suggested that CR results in a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine levels [5, 40]. However, in the present study, we maintained the same caloric intake for volunteers during monitoring in the 3 study periods. Another plausible mechanism for the reduction in proinflammatory cytokine levels during diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) could be through the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which has been shown to augment proinflammatory cytokine levels [41].",da163d66-3e22-43b6-bee7-4f15d8dc6b7e
33,discussion7," Fasting has been reported to lead to decreased IGF-1 levels in animals [42]. A recent study demonstrated a significant reduction in IGF-1 levels during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) compared to baseline [43].  The present study had strengths, as well as limitations. The strength of this study rested in that it was the first study to assess plasma levels and circadian patterns of selected proinflammatory cytokines in volunteers performing diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) during and outside of Ramadan while controlling for several confounders that might affect the levels of the measured cytokines. A good control of confounders was achieved during fasting protocol was labeled as “Fasting outside Ramadan” (FOR), and this may explain the better results obtained during fasting protocol was labeled as “Fasting outside Ramadan” (FOR). Nevertheless, the current study had also inherent limitations that need to be addressed.",91f519b9-1ee1-490e-ae68-46b81bd6c1b4
34,discussion8," All experimental studies that have performed several physiological measurements under controlled conditions in a restricted time period (Ramadan month), had only a relatively small number of participants included. This has been an inherent limitation of all previous studies that used a similar design and objectively assessed physiological parameters under controlled conditions [9, 19, 44–47]. Another point that needs to be addressed is the fact that this study was conducted on healthy, non-obese young males; hence the current results cannot be extrapolated to females, different age groups or obese subjects with comorbidities. Females were not included in this study, because from a religious point of view, they have to break the fast during the menstrual cycle. Lastly, as the study group was enrolled from within a university, the studied sample may not represent the general public because University employees are more likely to have higher education than the general public.",8f929df7-e925-4be8-980d-66f55101a414
35,discussion9,"  In summary, in young healthy male volunteers on predetermined caloric intake, set proportions of carbohydrate, fat, and protein consumption and similar light exposure and sleep schedules during baseline and diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) exposure, diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) resulted in significantly decreased plasma levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8), particularly IL-1β and IL-6, across 24 h. However, diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) had no effect on the circadian patterns of the measured cytokines as shown by cosinor analysis. The current findings suggest that diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) might aid in overall health promotion by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines.",64730c7b-abf8-4824-90a2-a5ae121b88fc
36,discussion10,"  Future studies should examine the timely persistence of this reduction in basal cytokines expression levels after Ramadan and whether diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) has similar anti-inflammatory effects under conditions of chronic inflammation, such as obesity and other chronic inflammatory disorders.  We thank the participants who despite their busy schedules agreed to participate in this project. Without their dedication and involvement, this research project would not have been executed. =",284c8e21-3ad8-43ac-bb19-3da94aeb68d7
