Study characteristics (author, year, country, trial registration, patient inclusion criteria, intervention, control, and follow-up) and physical parameters [weight, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), waist circumference (WC)], biochemical parameters [fasting insulin, fasting glucose, total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG)] were extracted from the included studies.",a0b878bb-523c-483c-9c3f-89b3f1f4c731
4,methods3,"  Intermittent fasting patterns were diverse, and the current major dietary patterns were Alternate day fasting (ADF), time restricted feeding (TRF), intermittent energy restriction (IER), and Ramadan fasting (7, 8). This study was roughly divided into daily time restricted feeding (TRF), weekly time restricted feeding (TRF), Alternate day fasting (ADF), and Ramadan fasting based on the time and frequency of fasting with IF. Among these, daily time restricted feeding (TRF) referred to a feeding window of 4–12 h per day and fasting for the remaining of the day. Weekly time restricted feeding (TRF) referred to fasting for 2–3 days per week consisting of a 5:2 diet and a 3:4 diet. Control group dietary patterns were diverse, including groups following uncontrolled habitual “non-intervention diets,” “calorie restriction,” “continuous energy restriction,” and “daily energy restriction” groups: the last three are referred to in this study as CR.

IF vs. Non-intervention Diet  Nineteen studies reported the weight of participants after IF and for those who maintained the non-intervention diet. The results illustrated that IF induced greater weight loss (weight (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.09–2.12, p = 0.03) (supplementary Table 2). For body mass index (BMI), the collective analysis of body mass index (BMI) as a result of following the IF diets resulted in greater reductions in body mass index (BMI) compared to the body mass index (BMI) following habitual diets (weight (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.08–0.68, p = 0.01) (Figure 2A).

16,results17,"  Subgroup Analysis  The main pattern of IF in this study was Alternate day fasting (ADF) and weekly time restricted feeding (TRF), so they were compared with CR separately. The physical and biochemical parameters of participants in Alternate day fasting (ADF) and CR groups that were included in the investigation were weight, body composition, glucose, and blood lipids. According to the statistical results, there was no significant difference in all parameters between the two groups. In other words, the effects of Alternate day fasting (ADF) and CR on participants were similar (Table 3).

24,discussion0," At present, more and more people in the world are suffering from metabolic diseases and obesity (1). Although IF was considered to be related to undesired outcomes, such as gout, arrhythmia, and peptic ulcer (55), it is still widely believed to be able to reduce weight, relive rheumatoid arthritis, and slow down aging (56, 57), even if they still disagreed on cancer (58, 59). In this study, IF was compared with a non-intervention diet and CR, respectively. In addition, subgroup analysis was conducted based on the pattern of IF, sex, and specific population, which narrowed the population within the overweight or obese population.  In our study, IF was found to have significant benefits in improving outcome indices for weight, FM, insulin, and blood lipids compared to a non-intervention diet. These results were similar to previous studies (6, 56, 60), indicating that IF can result in desirable weight loss and better health.",15a17e84-e287-49f1-ba9d-da8a7b312395
25,discussion1," However, there was no difference in fasting blood glucose in participants between the IF group and the non-intervention diet group in this study. It might be due to the fact that the included population in our analysis was mostly non-diabetic individuals, so the basal glucose concentrations were relatively low, resulting in slight fluctuations. As for the results of insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR, IF was proved to be potentially beneficial in relieving insulin resistance. In addition, during the analysis of our study, it was found that in some studies, participants' IF was accompanied by physical exercise. The combination may be more conducive to improving participants' health than IF alone (40). But subjects in both intervention and control groups in the same randomized controlled trial (RCT) performed exercise or neither, so the effect of physical activity on this analysis was controllable.",05fd9af5-eedb-4379-b068-0c581cf08d68
26,discussion2," In this study, IF was about as effective as CR, only slightly better than CR in reducing WC. Although some researchers believed that, compared with CR, IF had better compliance in participants and was more beneficial in reducing FM (11, 57), other studies showed that long-term compliance of IF was limited due to the high dropout rate (in contrast to CR, IF had a 38% dropout rate) (61, 62).  As for the comparison between Alternate day fasting (ADF) and CR, the subgroup analysis based on the dietary pattern of IF found that Alternate day fasting (ADF) had no greater beneficial effects than CR in our study, but other studies showed a difference in superior compliance, FM, and fat free mass (FFM) in the Alternate day fasting (ADF) group (11, 63). Furthermore, Alternate day fasting (ADF) also did not have the burden of chronic poor feeding and other adverse outcomes compared to CR (58).",8102be0e-e65c-4c43-9564-518551b5b49c
27,discussion3," However, some investigators believed that Alternate day fasting (ADF) might not be a viable public health intervention because of considerably and continuously reported hunger by Patterson et al. (8, 64). It was believed that hunger affected participants' enthusiasm and adherence to fasting (64). In addition, compared to Alternate day fasting (ADF), weekly time restricted feeding (TRF) exerted significant advantages on the regulation of WC, FM, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Another meta-analysis also reported that besides weight, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and insulin regulation, time restricted feeding (TRF) was also more effective in reducing fat free mass (FFM) (12).  In addition, IF might play a small role in women because FM was the only parameter that was found to be significantly reduced after IF in women. Comparatively, IF was found to have significantly reduced weight and TG in men. The reason for the difference based on sex was currently not clear.",d0e7dc62-2bd7-4a2b-888e-a9fa3a708d0e
28,discussion4," It may be due to the differences in energy intake between men and women, but this study was not able to qualitatively compare the energy intake between men and women because of different randomized controlled trial (RCT) settings with different energy limits. Besides, we also assumed that it might be related to the sex-depending fat distribution and sex hormones (65). Estrogen was considered to be able to suppress appetite and reduce the accumulation of belly fat, while androgen promoted food intake. However, research on the relationship between IF and human sex hormones is lacking. Moreover, our subgroup analysis against patients with overweight or obesity showed that IF could not provide more benefit to this particular population. This was at odds with previous studies by researchers who believed that IF is functional in regulating blood pressure, TC, and TG, especially more than CR does, in patients with overweight or obesity (30, 66).",7b697fbc-1e21-498d-91d6-116a366f4628
29,discussion5," One theory we speculated was the insufficient quantity of included studies, another might be that the intervention time was relatively short in our study, which was a median follow-up of only 3 months, thus no appearance of IF efficacy was observed.  In many ways, the effects of IF and CR overlapped significantly (55). The essence of both IF and CR was to reduce energy intake. The difference was that CR maintained a normal eating frequency, while IF was no or small amounts of energy intake during fasting (58). Although most of the included studies in this study did not perform energy intake interventions during non-fasting periods, there were still some studies that restricted energy intake during feeding periods, and certain eating patterns of IF also shaped a certain degree of energy restriction (18, 48). Thus, while IF was discovered to be superior to the non-intervention diet in this study, it was unclear whether time restriction or energy restriction played a greater role.",d07a2f2c-5232-4b0f-8c66-d0fc2f9b753e
30,discussion6," In contrast, in our study, IF and CR had few differences in their effects on participants, while the previous studies showed that CR could promote weight loss, relieve insulin resistance, improve insulin sensitivity, lower TG and TC, and elevate high density lipoprotein (HDL) (67). Although IF did not restrict calories in some of the included studies (36), it is suspected in this study that CR may be dominant as time restriction did not seem to play a role.  Some researchers suggested that weight loss after CR was due to the adaptation to metabolically induced reductions in FM and fat free mass (FFM) (67, 68). The weight loss resulting from IF was also due to the reduction of FM and fat free mass (FFM).",2829f09c-ffa9-4f19-b12e-9581b309715f
31,discussion7," However, the difference was that IF, in addition to metabolic adaptations, consumed the stored hepatic glycogen 10–12 h after fasting and then generated massive ketone bodies through the oxidation of fatty acids in adipose tissue, which would be used as the energy source of the whole body (69, 70). Therefore, an increase in blood ketones was found after IF, but not after CR alone (55). Unfortunately, this investigation was not included in this study. The decrease in blood TG might also be due to the oxidative breakdown of fat and the restriction of fat intake (67). Although previous studies attributed weight loss after IF and CR to the reduction of FM and fat free mass (FFM) (67, 70), it was an important discovery in this study that IF preserved fat free mass (FFM) better. This finding contributes to further recognition of IF, which is that IF does not damage lean tissue, dissipating the concern of IF being the potential cause of osteoporosis and sarcopenia (12).",f7fbb83e-d675-4900-8736-d97c99c6bc44
32,discussion8,"  One of the neuroendocrine mechanisms by which CR mediated was that CR could cause decreased levels of anabolic hormones including insulin, leptin, estrogen, and testosterone (71). CR in combination with weight loss can further improve insulin sensitivity, which might lead to decreased insulin secretion (72). In addition to the above possible mechanisms, IF might also act on the central nervous system via ketone bodies generated by fat metabolism. This process enhances the effect of leptin and insulin on the central nervous system, which normally regulates food intake and insulin sensitivity as well as resistance (62). Herein, insulin levels decreased, and insulin resistance was relieved after IF with no significance. Both CR and IF lowered TC (67). This is probably due to the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (55, 71). IF might lower TC by inhibiting TC production via suppressing this pathway.",b78d297b-92e6-4de5-97d3-07a11e392052
33,discussion9," Since this pathway could also be activated by CR, it is reasonable to discover no difference in TC concentrations between the two intervention groups.  Researchers have proposed three possible mechanisms for IF, such as circadian rhythms, gastrointestinal microbiota, and modifiable lifestyle behaviors (8). Some researchers argued that the human body clock was affected by, but not limited to, metabolic hormones, nutrients, intracellular metabolism, and intestinal flora (73). The human circadian rhythms regulate eating, sleep, hormonal and physiological processes, coordinated metabolism, and energetics. Certain patterns of IF might affect the body clock by revising the time humans eat, thus realigning metabolism and energy allocation to ensure human health (8). Sutton's study of daily time restricted feeding (TRF), and 6-h daily eating during 5 weeks, showed that time restricted feeding (TRF) improved cardio-metabolic health (74).",c0d8db2b-b41b-4cc1-acf5-bb0906028c7b
34,discussion10," Unfortunately, due to the limited number of studies, we were unable to conduct a comparative analysis between daily time restricted feeding (TRF) and CR or a non-intervention diet. In contrast, the feeding window of the non-fasting period for weekly time restricted feeding (TRF) and Alternate day fasting (ADF) was not addressed in the viewed randomized controlled trial (RCT)s (45, 75), so it was unknown whether circadian rhythms play a role in these two patterns of IF. An irregular and inappropriate diet might lead to metabolic disorders and other adverse consequences (73). Although current IF was actually accompanied by energy restriction, it was undeniable that IF limited daytime hours of feeding, which might contribute to improved parameters (8). Both the two other hypotheses, such as gastrointestinal microbiota and modifiable lifestyle behaviors, lacked human clinical trials and could not be confirmed in relation to IF in this study.",600250c4-9c7d-4820-98d1-1f115e7d677a
35,discussion11,"  This study is a systematic meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trial (RCT)s of IF, and it is multi-angle and relatively comprehensive compared with previous meta-analyses (76–78). This study compared IF with CR and non-intervention diets separately, and subgroup analysis was performed according to the patterns of IF and population characteristics. However, there are still considerable limitations in this study. First, this study mixes various patterns of IF, which might reduce the reliability and interpretability. Second, part of the outcomes, such as hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, could not be analyzed in this study due to insufficient data, which might produce publication bias. Moreover, although subgroup analysis was conducted, the role of various factors such as the long-term effect of IF was not thoroughly analyzed in detail due to the limited number of studies.",c15a92fe-538a-4281-a970-4854d33726ad
36,discussion12," Finally, only studies that were published in English were included, which also may bring publication bias.  Conclusion  In conclusion, our analysis revealed that IF was more beneficial in improving body weight, WC, and FM without affecting lean mass compared to a non-intervention diet. IF could also improve the condition of insulin resistance and blood lipid compared with non-intervention diets, but act similar to CR. Different patterns of IF had different effects on metabolism. Moreover, the effects of IF were not uniform across women and men or in the overweight or obese population. More and larger multicentered studies are needed to evaluate IF, while this study may lay a foundation for follow-up research to examine more extensively the reliable effects of IF.
