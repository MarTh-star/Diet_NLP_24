0,results0," Sixteen elite fitness coaches (age: 29±3 years; height: 183±6 cm; body mass: 82±5 kg, body mass index: 24.7±1.8 kg/m2) participated in this retrospective study. All were Muslim and fasted during the second month of confinement (month of Ramadan: Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF)).  PA data during the four consecutive months is presented in Figure 1(Fig. 1). There was a significant effect of consecutive months on step count and duration of PA (p< 0.001, ղp2= 0.98-0.83). Step count and duration of PA decreased during the 1st month of confinement by 56 % and 19 %, respectively (p<0.001), and was maintained lower throughout the 2nd month of confinement (Ramadan) vs. pre-confinement. During post-confinement, values of both parameters significantly increased (p<0.001, %change = +117 % and +26 %, respectively) compared to the 2nd month of confinement to regain pre-confinement values.  HR (bpm) and spent calories parameters during the four consecutive months are presented in Figure 2(Fig. 2).",b8bb2db1-4f96-4f52-a669-8ce72f0892f4
1,results1," There was a significant effect of consecutive months on resting (p<0.001) and peak (p=0.03) HRs, and calories/day (p<0.001) data with ղp2=0.78-0.87. Resting HR increased (7 %, p=0.005), while calories/day decreased (-11 %, p<0.001) during the 1st month of confinement vs. pre-confinement. These differences were further exacerbated during the 2nd month of confinement (p<0.001 vs. pre-confinement). During post-confinement, resting HR decreased (5 %, p<0.05), and calories/day increased (20 %, P<0.001) compared to the 2nd month of confinement to reach a similar level as pre-confinement. For HR peak, a significant difference was registered between the 1st month of confinement and post-confinement with lower values during the confinement (p<0.05). The result indicated also that HR peak was 3 % (5 bpm) higher (p˃0.05) in the post-confinement (174±8 bpm) vs. pre-confinement (169±11 bpm).  HR (%PMHR) parameters during the four consecutive months are presented in Figure 2(Fig. 2).",eaee482c-1712-4a56-89dd-27750842bd19
2,results2," There was a significant effect of consecutive months on resting (p<0.05) and peak (p=0.03) HRs. Resting HR increased during the 1st and 2nd months of confinement vs. pre-confinement. During post-confinement, resting HR decreased compared to the 2nd month of confinement to reach a similar level as pre-confinement. For HR peak, a significant difference was registered between the 1st month of confinement and post-confinement with lower values during the confinement.  Figure 3(Fig. 3) illustrates the RR parameters during the four consecutive months. There was a significant effect of consecutive months on the highest and average RRs (p<0.001, ղp2=0.62-0.71), but not on the lowest RR. Compared to pre-confinement, the highest and average RRs decreased significantly during the 2nd month of confinement (p<0.001, -14 %, and -10 %, respectively). During post-confinement, values of both parameters significantly increased (p<0.",679db3a2-e5a2-454c-bf67-a0a9d32d6346

The highest RR was 8.8 % higher (p˃0.05) in the post-confinement (22 ± 2) than in the pre-confinement (20 ± 3).  Figure 4(Fig. 4) reports a significant increase during the 1st month of confinement compared to pre-confinement for total sleep (8 %, p=0.02), rapid eye movements (REMS) (56 %, p=0.02) and sleep latency (523 %, p<0.001) times. These increases were further enlarged during the 2nd month of confinement (p<0.001 compared to pre-confinement). For deep and light sleep times, a significant difference compared to pre-confinement was registered only during the 2nd month of confinement (p=0.02 and p<0.001, respectively) with lower values of deep sleep (36 %) and higher values of light sleep (26 %) durations during the 2nd month of confinement. During the post-confinement month, all sleep parameters returned to pre-confinement levels. ",f8056259-6a20-4450-8fca-adc63bd8f4fe
4,discussion0," Data measured by wearable technology revealed that home confinement-induced detraining was accompanied by detrimental cardiorespiratory and sleep responses, which were enlarged during the 2nd month of confinement (corresponding to Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF)). However, the increased level of PA during the post-confinement month successfully reversed these negative adaptations.  Effect of home confinement on PA, physiological, and sleep variables  Our results demonstrated a marked decrease in step count during the 1st and the 2nd month of confinement. Additionally, a decrease in PA time was observed from pre- to during-confinement. These results were expected, as all participants were banned or forbidden to leave their homes, thus preventing them from engaging in their regular PA. Moreover, the decrease in step count was more significant during the 2nd month of confinement, likely due to participants training less during the lockdown.",f7399971-f08e-417d-be71-4ca852ff2448
5,discussion1," Changes in routine, increased stress, and increased anxiety are factors that decrease engagement in PA (Andreato et al., 2020[7]). Furthermore, our results reported calories spent/day decreased during the 1st month of confinement and continued to decrease during the 2nd month of confinement. It should be acknowledged that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) month (i.e., 4th pillar of Islam, during which Muslim adults are not allowed to eat and drink from dawn to sunset during a consecutive 29 or 30 days) occurred during the 2nd month of confinement. Lessan et al. (2018[27]) reported that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) results in profound disruptions of daily activity patterns, marked by a decrease in the total number of steps per day. It appears that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) could have exacerbated the decrease of the total number of steps during the 2nd month of confinement.",cedb0a5c-9d2e-46d0-bf7c-a24f573f1019
6,discussion2,"  The marked decrement in PA, step counts, and calories/day in response to the increase of detraining period during home confinement may also reduce cardiovascular fitness. The reduced PA reached levels well below the daily recommendation of 7500-10,000 steps per day and may further exacerbate inactivity-related health problems (Booth et al., 2017[8]). In the same context, our findings show resting HR increased during the 1st and the 2nd months of confinement. Narici et al. (2021[32]), reported that the spent sitting time has been linked with a reduced cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular performance. Moreover, the reduction of PA to <5000 steps/day for only a few days can impair nitric oxide mediated vasodilation (Porcelli et al., 2020[34]). Additionally, the present results showed a decrease in the average and highest RR during home confinement.",62793123-41a5-4699-9a0e-97beb69d68fc
7,discussion3," The decrease in average and highest RR could be explained by the reduction in PA time and step counts and/or exercise intensity accompanied by increased behavioral stress.  Low-intensity exercise training was recommended to prevent COVID-19 (Ghram et al., 2021[21]; Jiménez-Pavón et al., 2020[25]). Acute responses to higher intensities and volumes of exercise can involve a greater risk of illness and impaired immune function (Moreira et al., 2009[28]). In this context, Toresdahl and Asif (2020[46]) advised athletes to follow a conservative approach, limiting training sessions to <60 minutes and to <80 % of maximum ability during this time to prevent contracting COVID-19.  Our results showed a modification of sleep parameters during home confinement. Total sleep time increased by 8 % during the 1st month of confinement. In addition, total sleep time increased further during the 2nd month of confinement (i.e., Ramadan month).",8cabaeff-f128-488a-ae5d-7b9de4d8e357
8,discussion4," The previous finding was unexpected as the results of previous meta-analyses (Faris et al., 2020[20]; Trabelsi et al., 2020[48]) concluded a decrease in total sleep time in athletes during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). The decrease in training load/PA levels could have blinded the effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on total sleep time. Additionally, sleep latency, and rapid eye movements (REMS) increased during home confinement. The increase in the total sleep time, sleep latency, and rapid eye movements (REMS) during home confinement may be due to people staying home and not waking up to go to work. However, deep sleep time decreased during home confinement, despite the increase of total sleep time. The decrease of deep sleep time is associated with an increase in sleep latency, which was not previously observed during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) in physically active individuals (Hsouna et al.",a54d2aae-3a06-4cbc-b275-40bfce098059
9,discussion5,", 2019[24]), indicating an impairment of sleep quality during home confinement (Akerstedt et al., 1994[2]). Again, changes in routine and increased stress and anxiety may decrease the quality of sleep and impede engagement in PA.  Effect of post-confinement on PA, physiological, and sleep variables  Interestingly, the results showed all sleep parameters were restored during post-confinement. Furthermore, we observed an increase in PA time associated with a marked increase in step count during the 1st month of post-confinement. PA time and step count increased during post-confinement reaching the same values as pre-confinement. Calories/day was also restored during home confinement; however, unlike parameters of sleep and PA, physiological parameters (Resting HR, HRpeak and highest RR) were not fully restored. Our finding highlighted higher values of HRpeak and highest RR during post-confinement vs. pre-confinement.",5f34783c-4794-4b50-983e-ef5d6b68f877
10,discussion6," This may be related to the adaptation difficulties of HR response with the same training load performed during post-confinement compared to pre-confinement. We hypothesized that fitness coaches had a decline in physical fitness during post-confinement due to significantly reduced training. Although they succeeded to enhance their quality of sleep and their daily PA, those parameters were still lower compared to the pre-confinement; participants also become more fatigable during post-confinement vs. pre-confinement. Our findings confirm a modified lifestyle due to home confinement can lead to serious deficits in the quality and quantity of training (Andreato et al., 2020[7]). Our work is in agreement with Narici et al. (2021[32]), who reported that living in home-confinement for several weeks represents a physiological challenge with subsequent significant health risks.",3591611f-7e52-49a4-9f74-1949b9e34ac7
11,discussion7," It has been showed that in response to 20-day bed confinement, young healthy participants lose on average 11 % of heart volume and 28 % of maximum oxygen uptake (Saltin et al., 1968[40]). Furthermore, a period of 2-4 weeks of detraining causes a decrease in blood volume together with a decrease in haemoglobin content. These physiological changes cause a decrease in muscle capillarization and a loss of efficiency of the body temperature regulation mechanisms (Costill et al., 1985[14]; Souissi et al., 2022[43]). Furthermore, after a detraining period longer than one month, a decrease in skeletal muscle oxidative enzyme activity is observed (Costill et al., 1985[14]). This important mismatch of the aerobic system, both from the central and the peripheral perspectives, requires attention during the retraining phase.",f7e1eeae-2c27-4d18-8f48-c131d030960b
12,discussion8,"  Based on these profound physiological changes of the aerobic system, the training period during home confinement should be based on a careful choice of intensity volume, and type of training. Herrera-Valenzuela et al. (2020[23]) recommended high-intensity interval training at home to maintain cardiorespiratory endurance and physical fitness. Similarly, Jukic et al. (2020[26]) warned that detraining is one of the biggest negative consequences of the current “stay at home” confinement. Therefore, the authors recommended that the athlete's house should be equipped with cardiovascular and resistance training equipment (e.g., portable cycle or rowing ergometer). It is also recommended that athletes incorporate some type of endurance exercise into their daily routine to avoid the effects of detraining during the forced quarantine.",c4aec18c-d637-4be1-a635-5bae8ff9de3e
13,discussion9," However, to avoid increased chances for upper respiratory tract infections, the athlete should train at relatively high intensities, but should not fully exhaust themselves during a training session (Moreira et al., 2009[28]; Puta et al., 2017[35]). This study also provided insight regarding the use of smart wearable devices; digital technology has become popular in the general population and has already been adopted for health monitoring. To date, smart devices have been generally used to investigate PA in daily life, showing to be effective and applicable for a large part of the healthy population and patients. Here we recommend the use of smartwatch technologies by patients, athletes, and scientific researchers based on the amount of data that they can provide and cost effectiveness.",8df2c846-9de6-42e4-9f5d-aa9617fc143a
14,discussion10," The authors, therefore, hope that, like seasonal influenza, COVID-19 will become endemic in the human population, and that COVID-19 vaccines will be incorporated as an add-on to seasonal influenza vaccinations, provided every winter for at least the next few decades (Dergaa et al., 2021[15]; Musa et al., 2021[29]). With proper immunization, the globe will return to pre-COVID levels of normalcy, and with the hope that COVID-19 lockdown scenario will not recur.  The present study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. Our findings pertain only to physically active males. Future studies on female individuals are warranted. In addition, a control non-Muslim group (not fasting during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF)) is lacking; however, the recruitment of such group is difficult in Muslim countries.  Perspective  We observed significant issues related to the training of fitness coaches during the COVID-19 pandemic.",73f73948-6d48-41aa-8b54-67965ab36e2b
15,discussion11," Fitness levels deteriorated with the confinement, even while attempting to maintain regular training. Consequently, fitness coaches significantly reduced training and experienced a decline in physical fitness and their sleep quality during home confinement. Although they enhanced their quality of sleep, daily PA, and physical fitness during post-confinement, they failed to reach the same level of performance as pre-confinement. Home-based exercise coupled with digital technology-based monitoring of physical fitness and sleep pattern could be recommended for fitness coaches and athletes during home confinement to prevent the decline in physical fitness and sleep quality.
