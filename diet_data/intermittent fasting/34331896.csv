0,background0," The overweight and obesity epidemic has become one of the most alarming public health threats. Although largely preventable, the worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016 and shows an increasing trend. In 2016, >1.9 billion adults were overweight, and 650 million were obese. If this current trend continues, it is estimated that 2.7 billion and >1 billion adults will be overweight and obese, respectively, by 2025 [1]. In Malaysia, the National Health and Morbidity Survey (National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS)) 2019 reported that 50.1% of adults were either overweight (30.4%) or obese (19.7%), which increased compared with the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2011 (overweight 29.4% and obesity 15.1%) and 2015 (overweight 30% and obesity 17.7%) findings [2].  The relationship between obesity and poor health outcomes is well established.",af87cc75-aa6d-4457-b2b9-71b33e6f5e83
1,background1," Despite the increased risk of noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, stroke, coronary heart disease, and certain cancers, a growing body of literature has demonstrated a positive relationship between obesity and various mental health issues such as depression and poor quality of life [3,4]. The World Health Organization has established multiple strategies that describe the actions that need to be taken by stakeholders at the global, regional, and local levels to combat obesity in adults and children. Furthermore, effective and feasible policy actions have been included in the “Global action plan on physical activity 2018-2030: more active people for a healthier world” to increase physical activity globally [1].  As obesity occurs because of a positive energy balance in the body, strategies for preventing and treating obesity mainly focus on dietary modification and increasing physical activity.",7aad24fb-efb0-40bf-851a-b1a8ad5da9a2
2,background2," A form of calorie restriction dietary protocol is intermittent fasting (IF), which encompasses various eating diet plans that cycle between fasting and nonfasting states over a defined period to create a negative energy balance, thereby inducing weight loss. Studies have shown that IF is effective in reducing body weight and improving metabolic outcomes [5,6]. Although the effects of wet IF have been well documented, the benefits of dry IF (except for Ramadhan fasting for Muslims) have not been clearly indicated in previous studies. Wet or water IF is defined as fasting during which all food and drink except water are restricted [7], whereas dry IF is complete fasting without any food and fluid intake [8]. In countries with predominantly Muslims, the practice of dry fasting during Ramadan and the voluntary 2 days per week fasting (Mondays and Thursdays) are widely conducted.",f1777bd1-e725-406f-a080-db9333266c33
3,background3,"  As portion size is a crucial determinant of energy intake, portion control by controlling serving size is another practical method for reducing calorie intake and promoting weight loss. This portion-control method has been widely practiced and studied worldwide, using different portion divisions depending on the culture and eating habits [9,10]. The Malaysia Healthy Plate, a portion-control dietary plan, was created to translate the messages in the Malaysia Dietary Guideline 2010 and Malaysia Food Pyramid 2010 [11]. It is a visual tool that emphasizes the quarter-quarter-half concept and provides a quick visual technique that helps ensure that the intake of food is within the recommended guidelines. Specifically, the Malaysia Healthy Plate is a single-meal guide that divides the plate into a quarter plate of grains or grain products; a quarter plate of fish, poultry, meat, or egg; and a half plate of fruits and vegetables [12].",eda97c05-84f8-499f-b39f-52248ba3dbd0
4,background4,"  Objectives  Although weight loss has been reported in studies of conventional IF, the adaptive phenomenon of dry IF on 2 nonconsecutive days per week on cardiometabolic and anthropometric outcomes remain unclear. Similarly, although the Malaysian Healthy Plate policy has been widely practiced and publicized since 2010, the effectiveness of this eating plan in improving cardiometabolic risks and promoting weight loss is still not well documented. Thus, we established the Cardiometabolic and Anthropometric Outcomes of Intermittent Fasting study to determine the cardiometabolic, anthropometric, dietary intake, and quality of life changes among civil servants with overweight and obesity, following combined IF and healthy plate (intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP)) and healthy plate (HP) and explore the participants’ experiences throughout the study. We hypothesized that combining dry IF and HP diet protocols will improve these parameters more than HP alone. ",f194738e-2fe7-4ea0-8bca-07ca95a55351
5,methods0," Study Design  This is a quasi-experimental study applying a mixed study method that consists of 2 parts: quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative part involved allocating participants into 2 intervention arms: the combined intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) group and the HP group and measuring the parameters of cardiometabolic risk and anthropometrics at baseline, month 3 and month 6. The qualitative part aimed to explore the facilitators and barriers that enabled or admonished the success of weight loss in the intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) group through focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted at month 6.  Study Site  The participants were allocated to each intervention arm according to the institutes in the National Institutes of Health in Setia Alam; the Institute for Medical Research, Jalan Pahang; and the Institut Latihan Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia (Teknologi Makmal Perubatan), Jalan Pahang.",9a598b9a-6299-4b21-b4e4-64965157402e
6,methods1," The distance between Jalan Pahang and Setia Alam is approximately 40 km. The allocation was done in such a manner to avoid contamination bias. The study population had a relatively similar sociodemographic features, environment, facility, and nature of work. The allocation of the intervention was determined a priori and was based on the feasibility of monitoring the study participants.  Study Population  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  Workers aged 19 to 59 years with a BMI of ≥23 kg/m2 (overweight or obese), ready to participate in the intervention (assessed through readiness to participate in screening), and providing informed consent were included in this study.",df98b7b8-243b-4d19-a225-a56be748e806

Sample Size  Sample size calculation was conducted using a power and sample size program. It followed the rules required for comparison between the 2 groups [13]. The sample size was estimated using the level of significance (α=.05) and power of the study (1-β=.",48fab4b5-bd34-4324-8b1d-6a6db3e400f9
8,methods3,"80), minimum suggested difference (delta) of 5% (SD 10%) weight loss that may be achieved under this intervention, and the corresponding differences among groups. The assumption of 5% weight loss used in the sample size calculation was based on a review conducted by Ryan and Yockey [14], which stated that a minimum weight loss of 5% is needed to improve cardiometabolic risk such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The minimum sample size required for this study was 64 participants. Considering 40% attrition, the required sample size for each arm was 90 participants. A total of 180 participants were required for this study.  Dietary Protocols  The combined intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) regimen consisted of dry fasting from dawn to dusk for 2 days a week (Mondays and Thursdays) and practice of HP for the rest of the week. During the fasting days, the participants were encouraged to have a meal before dawn.",98e13b15-9e5b-4dff-b99d-8757fc96c3b2
9,methods4," No food or drink was allowed after dawn (approximately 13 hours) until sunset. They did not need to follow an HP diet on the fasting day. Smoking and sexual activity were also forbidden during the fasting day, following the Sunnah fasting obligation. Fasting adherence records were taken as 0, 1, or 2 fasting day or days per week. For the rest of the week, they were obligated to consume meals according to the HP concept. The female participants were discouraged from fasting during menstruation.  Participants in the HP group were asked to practice the HP concept daily: division of plate portions into a quarter for protein, a quarter for complex carbohydrates, and a half for fruits and vegetables. Participants were advised to practice HP for all 3 main meals per day. However, the practice of at least one HP meal per day is considered the minimum requirement for adherence to the dietary protocol.",5fbded94-85c5-4772-b673-c761601af2f1
10,methods5," The research assistants (Nurul Hidayah binti Mat Yusoff and Norsyuhada binti Japri) monitored the intervention through a daily record of food intake picture (one meal per day) and a weekly fasting record.  Study Phases  Recruitment Phase  The recruitment of participants for this study comprised two phases: (1) health screening and (2) readiness to participate in screening. An invitation to participate in the study was sent through Google Forms, emails, and phone calls. Volunteers were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria by the study team. Those eligible were screened again for readiness to participate, which was conducted through face-to-face interviews. During the interviews, the participants’ readiness (motivation, willingness to commit, and enthusiasm) was assessed by a trained psychologist from the Institute for Health Behavioral Research. Only participants deemed ready to commit were included in the study.",0f087e74-ee97-4fde-a094-741267c482c0
11,methods6," Informed consent, as well as a behavioral contract, was signed by each enrolled participant after being clearly explained the purpose of each document in the research. Both researchers and participants were unblinded to the intervention.  Intervention Phase  The overall duration of the intervention phase was 6 months, with 12 weeks in the supervised phase, followed by 12 weeks in the unsupervised phase. During the supervised phase, the participants started the diet protocol according to the designated intervention group. In the intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) group, participants were reminded to fast, through a message sent to their mobile phones on the eve of fasting days, and accomplishments were recorded twice weekly. Participants in both groups were required to send a picture of one of their meals to the research assistant. In contrast, no fasting reminder, weekly fasting records, or meal pictures were sent during the latter unsupervised phase.",bf281128-7f84-4ac9-8e68-fc2b116fa7f2
12,methods7,"  Study Procedure  Quantitative Method  Data Collection  During the 6-month study duration, data collection was conducted at 3 points: baseline (before starting the supervised phase), month 3 (at the end of the supervised phase), and month 6 (at the end of the unsupervised phase). Participants were asked to answer questionnaires on social demography (during baseline only), the Food Frequency Questionnaire (Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF), and the Obesity and Weight-Loss Quality of Life (Obesity and Weight Loss Quality of Life (OWLQOL)) Questionnaire. Anthropometry measurements and fasting blood samples were taken. Oral glucose tolerance test and body composition analysis were also performed.  Self-administered Questionnaire  The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was used to determine the frequency of food and beverage consumption over the previous month.",a740a6b1-1910-4052-89cf-41ffd939c041
13,methods8," The questionnaire consisted of questions covering the frequency of cereals and cereal products, fast food, meat and meat products, fish and seafood, eggs, legumes and legume products, milk and milk products, vegetables, fruits, drinks, alcoholic drinks, confectionaries, bread spreads, and flavor intake. The validated Malay version of the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) used in this study consisted of 165 items, and the participants required approximately 30 minutes to answer the questions at each point of data collection [15]. The records were analyzed using Nutritionist Pro Nutrition Analysis Software 7.8.0 (Axxya Systems, 2021) to determine their energy and macronutrient intake.  To measure the quality of life, a validated Malay version of the Obesity and Weight Loss Quality of Life (OWLQOL) questionnaire was used.",28a59862-06d0-4f8a-ae6e-bf3214ac8757
14,methods9," The Obesity and Weight Loss Quality of Life (OWLQOL) is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses participants’ feelings about obesity and their efforts in weight loss [16]. The 17 Obesity and Weight Loss Quality of Life (OWLQOL) items consist of 7-point scale responses ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). The score for each item was reversed before the total score was obtained. Consequently, it was transformed to a scale of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life [17]. The Malay version of the questionnaire has been validated among 28 female health staff with overweight and obesity, with a Cronbach α of .953 [18]. The participants needed approximately 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire.  The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF was used to measure the participants’ physical activity in the past week. The questionnaire was validated for use by adults in 12 countries [19].",0765ef0c-cd43-4ad8-9ede-73bb2ecff0ad
15,methods10," In this study, we used the Malay version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF, which was validated in a study using data obtained from the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2011 [20]. The participants were requested to record how many days in the past week they spent on specific activities (vigorous and moderate activities and walking) for at least 10 minutes and the amount of time (in minutes) they engaged in a particular activity on an ordinary day. Physical activity level was calculated as the energy expenditure or metabolic equivalent task (metabolic equivalent task (MET)) minutes per week (metabolic equivalent task (MET)-minutes per week) based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scoring protocol [21]. To obtain metabolic equivalent task (MET) scores for each activity, the total minutes spent on vigorous activity, moderate-intensity activity, and walking over the last 7 days were multiplied by 8.0, 4.0, and 3.",3cc7eb27-2683-45ac-bebe-1178b0618fe1

Physical activity can also be categorized into low, moderate, and high physical activity levels, based on the scoring protocol available in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) website guidelines [21].  Sedentary behavior was also measured in this study. The question used to measure sedentary behavior was included in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-SF questionnaire, based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) sitting question. Participants were asked to state the total time they spent (hours) sitting or lying down, whether in the workplace, at home, or while traveling, excluding the time spent sleeping, on a typical day. The total daily sitting time was used as an indicator of sedentary behavior.",7f17c466-f616-41db-8414-96a610c371e2
17,methods12,"  Anthropometric Measurements  Body weight and height were measured using a seca electronic column scale (SECA measuring tape (SECA) GmbH and Co KG) in kilograms and centimeters to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively. Body weight was measured in light clothing, and participants were asked to remove their outer garments and shoes. BMI was calculated by dividing weight by height squared (kg/m2). As only participants with overweight and obesity were included, we categorized them into overweight (23.0-27.4 kg/m2), preobese (27.5-32.4 kg/m2), obese class I (32.5-37.4 kg/m2), and obese class II (≥37.5 kg/m2), based on the cutoff points for public health action for Malaysia [22].  Waist and hip circumferences were measured using a SECA measuring tape (SECA) measuring tape (SECA measuring tape (SECA)), to the nearest 0.1 cm with the participant standing.",d1e5bab2-1cb3-4ff4-8818-2f940fa62f15
18,methods13," Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the top of the iliac crest and the lower margin of the last palpable rib, whereas hip circumference was measured at the widest diameter around the buttocks. The waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement. On the basis of the World Health Organization cutoff points, waist-to-hip ratio of ≥0.90 cm (men) and ≥0.85 cm (women) are abnormal, and the risks of metabolic complications substantially increased beyond these points [23].  Blood pressure was measured using an automated upper arm device (Omron Automated Blood Pressure Monitor; HEM 7130). Body composition parameters such as fat mass and fat-free mass were measured using a tetrapolar bioimpedance multifrequency InBody 770 analyzer (Biospace).

19,methods14,"  For each parameter measured 2 measurements were taken, and the average of the 2 measurements was calculated to minimize the measurement error.  Biochemical Testing  Before blood collection, all participants were required to fast overnight for approximately 8 to 10 hours. Approximately 15 ml of fasting venous blood was taken from participants by the medical officers for standard biochemical tests such as fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin, and fasting lipid profile such as triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) cholesterol. The oral glucose tolerance test was performed by asking the participant to drink a 250-mL solution that consists of 75 g of glucose, and another 5 mL of venous blood was collected 2 hours after the oral glucose tolerance test.  Blood samples were processed within 2 hours, and aliquots of serum or plasma samples were stored at −20 °C before analysis.",c05afb42-76f3-4c07-8b69-7fbe9bbdb841

Approximately 90.",182c9942-409a-44dd-8d58-17a7af0476e9
34,results3,"4% (160/177) of the participants in each group denied any history of smoking (intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP): 82/91, 90%; HP: 80/86, 93%); of the 15 participants who had a history of smoking, only 4 (27%) participants from each group were current smokers (intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP): 4/9, 44%; HP: 4/6, 67%). Regarding background illness history, only 5.1% (9/177) of participants reported being diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, whereas 1.1% (2/177) of participants were diagnosed with hypertension. However, all patients denied taking any medication for the illness (Table 2).  A comparison of anthropometric measurements of the study participants among the intervention groups is presented in Table 3. On the basis of the BMI category, most participants were preobese (69/177, 38.9%), followed by overweight (63/177, 35.6%), obese class I (32/177, 18.1%), and obese class II (13/177, 7.3%).",91a3cf7f-9502-4ce8-b6b2-6b6b2d8cb12b
35,results4," Although the BMI of the participants in the intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) group was slightly higher than that of the participants in the HP group, the difference was not statistically significant (P=.13; Table 3). Overall, no significant differences were observed in sociodemographic characteristics and anthropometric measurements between the 2 groups at baseline, except for ethnicity and job category (P<.05; Tables 2 and 3).  After 6 months after the intervention, 21 participants were interviewed for their feedback across 4 different groups: 2 being successful in their weight loss attempts and the other 2 groups that did not meet the requirements of weight loss reduction. Four main themes were constructed from the feedback given: efficacy toward the intervention, barriers and facilitators that enable or admonish weight loss attempts, support during the intervention, and perceived sustainability of the intervention.",7103824b-90f8-4cab-ab21-53c310868668
36,discussion0," Principal Findings  We hypothesized that there would be a significant improvement in cardiometabolic and anthropometric parameters among participants in the intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) group following the intervention after 3 and 6 months. We expected that these changes would also be present among participants in the HP group, but the degree of change would be more prominent among participants in the intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) group. We also believe that the effectiveness of the intervention in improving cardiometabolic and anthropometric outcomes was driven by both personal motivation and a strong support system.  The preliminary results showed no significant differences in most sociodemographic characteristics and anthropometric measurements of the participants between the 2 intervention groups.",f9eb62d5-84af-4f27-a68f-d2e3beb6def6
37,discussion1," The significant difference observed in job categories is most likely because of the departmental units stationed at the Institute for Medical Research Jalan Pahang being diagnostic based; thus, there was a higher proportion of medical laboratory technologists in the HP group than in the intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) group.  Comparison With Prior Work  On the basis of a meta-analysis by Harris et al [24], there was no significant difference in weight loss between continuous and intermittent energy restriction [24]. Thus, it can be concluded that to reduce body weight, intermittent energy restriction is an alternative method to continuous energy restriction and may be preferred because of its feasibility and practicality.  Despite robust evidence supporting the effectiveness of wet IF in reducing weight and improving cardiometabolic risks, the data on dry IF, especially 2 days per week fasting (such as fasting on Mondays and Thursdays) remain limited.",b4a22f80-6037-42d3-80ac-17664f5685ae
38,discussion2," Voluntary Sunnah fasting on Monday and Thursday is widely practiced by Muslims worldwide and is culturally more acceptable in Malaysia, as most Malaysians are Muslims. In 2013, Teng et al [25] compared the effect of dry fasting on Mondays and Thursdays combined with calorie restriction (fasting calorie restriction), with the control of metabolic parameters. They found that participants in the fasting calorie restriction groups showed significant interaction effects on body weight, BMI, body composition, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol compared with the participants in the control group [25]. However, as fasting was combined with calorie restriction and compared with the control group, the sole effect of fasting was not sought. Furthermore, the study was conducted among Malay men aged 50 to 70 years, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings to the general population.",3aec67be-9ccb-4339-b39e-1de865cc0716
39,discussion3," Meanwhile, this study compared the combined intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) with the use of HP method alone and involved adults (aged >18 years) of both sexes.  Strengths and Limitations  A strength of our study is that we applied both quantitative and qualitative methods. The mixed method allows us to measure the effectiveness of the intervention and explore the challenges of practicing it simultaneously. This integrated framework is crucial for a better understanding of the challenges faced during dietary intervention in obesity prevention programs so that it can be improvised in future programs to improve the outcomes and sustainability of health changes.  The main limitation of our study is the effect of the movement control order due to the COVID-19 pandemic on intervention compliance and weight management.",2323659b-677a-4bc8-af2b-c67b09449f45
40,discussion4," The implementation of movement control orders and work from home for those working would limit their physical activity, expose them to unhealthy eating, reduce their motivation toward weight loss, and affect their control of food intake. Studies have shown that social lockdowns have negative consequences on weight-related behavior and weight management [26,27].  Future Directions  Adherence to dietary interventions is essential to ensure the validity of research findings and, most importantly, to ascertain the sustainability of the desired outcomes beyond the research period. As described by the World Health Organization, adherence is “the extent to which a person’s behavior-taking medication, following a diet, and executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider” [28]. In this study, we examined the elements of adherence in both quantitative and qualitative parts.",afbe2955-a25c-4f68-a2d0-156b5a05ddcf
41,discussion5," Quantitatively, we investigated adherence to intervention and sustainability of outcomes’ changes in the unsupervised intervention phase. We measured the outcomes at the end of the phase and compared them with those of the previous 2 parameters. In the qualitative part, we assessed readiness to participate in screening during the recruitment phase, in which the motivation and readiness to comply with intervention protocols were assessed. In addition, FGDs were conducted at the end of the study to explore the participants’ experiences while undergoing the intervention, including barriers and enablers that influence their adherence to the diet protocols.  We plan to disseminate the study results to collaborating institutes and organizations, study participants, and respective stakeholders. These findings will be submitted to 2 peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences.",ce0129ed-76c1-4701-bcb6-40a441af03bc
42,discussion6,"  Conclusions  With the increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide, a weight loss method that is not only effective but also practical and easy to comply with is required. Although IF has been widely practiced and studied, data on the effectiveness of dry fasting in reducing weight and cardiometabolic risk are limited. We established the Cardiometabolic and Anthropometric Outcomes of Intermittent Fasting study to determine the effectiveness of a combined intermittent fasting and healthy plate (IFHP) and HP in improving anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes among civil servants with overweight and obesity. The mixed methods study was designed to measure the changes quantitatively, reflect the participants’ points of view, and ensure that the study findings are grounded in their experiences.",1c02b88d-738d-4c4f-b007-a0906cbc05e2
