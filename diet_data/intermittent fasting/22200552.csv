0,introduction0,"Intermittent fasting (IF) is a novel weight loss regimen that has been steadily growing in popularity over the past decade  [1]. This diet strategy generally involves severe restriction (75-90% of energy needs) on 1–2 days per week. Though clinical trial evidence is still limited  [2,3], preliminary findings indicate that IF may be effective for weight loss and coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) risk reduction. For instance, two recent trials of IF demonstrate decreases in body weight of 7-9% and reductions in LDL cholesterol of 10% after 20–24 weeks of treatment  [2,3]. While these data are encouraging, this diet therapy is limited in that a long duration of time, i.e. 24 weeks, is required to experience modest reductions in weight. One possible way to boost the rate of weight loss would be to combine IF with daily calorie restriction (CR). In following this protocol, the individual would fast one day per week, and then undergo mild CR, i.e.",a20e3bde-8c80-4135-ab35-2ef48cdef97b
1,introduction1," 20% restriction of energy needs, on 6 days per week. The incorporation of portion-controlled liquid meals may also enhance weight loss as it helps individuals to stay within the confines of their prescribed energy goals  [4,5]. The effect of IF combined with CR (with or without liquid meals) on body weight and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk has yet to be tested.  Although the mechanisms remain unclear, the lipid-lowering actions of dietary restriction protocols may be mediated, in part, by modulations in adipokines, i.e. fat-cell derived hormones and cytokines  [6]. Leptin is an adipokine that plays a role in coronary heart disease (CHD) development by increasing platelet aggregation  [7], and stimulating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells  [8]. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are pro-inflammatory mediators released by adipose tissue that are strong independent predictors of coronary heart disease (CHD)  [9].",b8bb3471-d59e-415e-80ff-f6b3f72c64fb
2,introduction2," C-reactive protein (C reactive protein (CRP)) is produced by adipose tissue in response to a rise in IL-6  [10]. C reactive protein (CRP) may play a role in atherogenesis by binding to oxidized LDL and promoting foam cell formation  [11]. Isoprostanes are another group of compounds released by adipose tissue  [12]. Isoprostanes act as markers of oxidative stress, and have been shown to accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions of carotid arteries derived from coronary heart disease (CHD) patients  [12]. Insulin-like growth hormone-1 (IGF-1), another adipose tissue-derived protein, may play a role in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) by stimulating the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells  [13]. Circulating concentrations of these hormones are dictated by regional fat distribution  [14]. Excess visceral adiposity, as determined by an increased waist circumference, is related to an increased incidence of dyslipidemia  [14].",bf69121c-71e9-43b3-834a-284893375a62
3,introduction3," Viscerally obese women (defined as a waist circumference >88 cm) have higher circulating levels of each of the above-mentioned adipokines, relative to subcutaneously obese women  [15]. The ability of IFCR to reduce visceral fat mass, and in turn, improve circulating adipokine profile, remains unknown.  Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to examine the effect of IFCR with a liquid-diet or food based diet on body weight and lipid risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) in obese women, and to evaluate how changes in adipokines are related to these modulations in vascular disease risk.

4,methods0,"Subjects Obese women were recruited from the Chicago area by means of advertisements placed on and around the University of Illinois campus. Seventy-seven individuals responded to the advertisements, and 60 were deemed eligible to participate after the preliminary questionnaire, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and waist circumference assessment. Key inclusion criteria were as follows: female, age 35–65 y, body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 39.9 kg/m2, waist circumference >88 cm, weight stable for 3 months prior to the beginning of the study, i.e. <5 kg weight loss or gain, non-diabetic, no history of cardiovascular disease, no history of cancer, sedentary or lightly active for 3 months prior to the beginning of the study, i.e. <3 h/week of light-intensity exercise at 2.5–4.0 metabolic equivalents (metabolic equivalents (METS)), non-smoker, and not taking weight loss, lipid-lowering, or glucose-lowering medications.",8cbcb8f2-bbb4-470c-9b55-fb9b9895dbac
5,methods1," Perimenopausal women were excluded from the study, and postmenopausal women (defined as absence of menses for 2 y) were required to maintain their current hormone replacement therapy regimen for the duration of the study. The experimental protocol was approved by the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and all volunteers gave written informed consent to participate in the trial.  Diet interventions Subjects were randomized by way of a stratified random sample, based on body mass index (BMI) and age, into either the IFCR-liquid diet (IFCR-L) group (n = 30) or IFCR-food based diet (IFCR-F) group (n = 30). A random number table was used to randomize the subjects from each strata into the intervention groups. The 10-week trial consisted of two dietary phases: 1) a 2-week baseline weight maintenance period, and 2) an 8-week weight loss period.",b4246ae4-f5bd-4d94-aa3e-a57d189fc0da
6,methods2,"  Baseline weight maintenance diet (Week 1–2) Each subject participated in a 2-week baseline weight maintenance period before commencing the 8-week weight loss intervention (Figure  1). During this period, subjects were requested to continue eating their usual diet and to maintain a stable body weight.  Figure 1 Experimental design.  Weight loss diets (Week 3–10) After the baseline period, subjects partook in either the IFCR-L or IFCR-F intervention for 8 weeks (Figure  1). The Mifflin equation was used to measure energy requirements  [16]. IFCR-L subjects (n = 30) consumed a calorie-restricted liquid diet for the first 6 days of the week, and then underwent a fast on the last day of the week (water consumption + 120 kcal of juice powder only, for 24 h). The liquid diet consisted of a liquid meal replacement for breakfast (240 kcal) and a liquid meal replacement for lunch (240 kcal).",5421e83b-b6d0-4bdd-b284-2a9e4e969acd
7,methods3," All liquid meal replacements were provided to the subjects in powder-form in premeasured envelopes (Isalean Shake, Isagenix LLC, Chandler, AZ). For the dinnertime meal, IFCR-L subjects consumed a 400–600 kcal meal. Food was not provided to the subjects for the dinner meal. Instead, subjects met with a Registered Dietician weekly to learn how to make healthy eating choices that are in compliance with the National Cholesterol Education Program Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC)) diet (i.e. <35% of kcal as fat; 50-60% of kcal as carbohydrates; <200 mg/d of dietary cholesterol; and 20–30 g/d of fiber). In following this 7 d intervention, IFCR-L subjects were energy restricted by 30% of their baseline needs. IFCR-F subjects (n = 30) consumed a calorie-restricted food-based diet for the first 6 days of the week, and then underwent a fast on the last day of the week (water consumption + 120 kcal of juice powder only, for 24 h).",0cd4ddfd-80a5-450d-9ec6-ecf0936c0b41
8,methods4," IFCR-F subjects ate 3 meals per day in accordance with the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet guidelines. Food was not provided to the subjects. Instead, subjects met with a Registered Dietician weekly to learn how to make healthy eating choices by implementing the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) guidelines. Subjects were instructed to eat approximately 240 kcal for breakfast, 240 kcal for lunch, and 400–600 kcal for dinner. In following this 7 d intervention, IFCR-F subjects were energy restricted by 30% of their baseline needs.  Analyses Dietary intake and physical activity assessment A multiple-pass, telephone-administered, 24-h recall was used to assess dietary intake. The recalls were performed at weeks 1, 3 and 10 by a trained Registered Dietician. Dietary intake data were analyzed using Nutrition Data System (Nutrition Data System (NDS)) software (version 2012; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN).",2e158310-c1f4-4a9b-a320-0a3be8306354
9,methods5," Furthermore, IFCR-L subjects were provided with a checklist each day to monitor: 1) adherence to the liquid meal protocol, and 2) adherence to the fast day regimen. IFCR-F subjects were also given a checklist to monitor their adherence to the fast day regimen. Alterations in energy expenditure associated with changes in physical activity were measured by the use of a pattern recognition monitor (Sense Wear Mini (SWM), Bodymedia, Pittsburgh, PA). Subjects wore the lightweight monitor on their upper arm for 7 d at week 3 and 10 of the trial. The data was analyzed using Bodymedia Software V.7.0, algorithm V.2.2.4 (Bodymedia, Pittsburgh, PA).  Hunger, satisfaction, and fullness assessment Subjects completed a validated visual analog scale (visual analog scale (VAS)) on each fast day approximately 5 min before going to bed (reported bedtime ranged from 8.00 pm to 1.20 am).",b6e66ec5-29e4-4ab7-8a0e-038007b5c633
10,methods6," In brief, the visual analog scale (VAS) consisted of 100-mm lines, and subjects were asked to make a vertical mark across the line corresponding to their feelings from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely) for hunger, satisfaction with diet, or fullness. The visual analog scale (VAS) was collected at the weigh-in each week and reviewed for completeness. Quantification was performed by measuring the distance from the left end of the line to the vertical mark.  Body weight and body composition assessment Body weight measurements were taken to the nearest 0.5 kg at the beginning of every week in light clothing and without shoes using a balance beam scale (HealthOMeter; Sunbeam Products, Boca Raton, FL). Height was assessed using a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. body mass index (BMI) was assessed as kg/m2.

Plasma lipids and adipokine assessment Fasting blood samples were collected between 6.00 am and 9.00 am at weeks 1, 3 and 10 after a 12-h fast. Blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 520 × g at 4°C to separate plasma from red blood cells and was stored at −80°C until analyzed. Plasma total cholesterol, direct LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were measured in duplicate by enzymatic kits (Biovision Inc, Mountainview, CA). LDL particle size was measured by linear polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Quantimetrix Lipoprint System, Redondo Beach, CA), as previously described  [17]. Leptin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, C reactive protein (CRP), 8-isoprostane, and IGF-1 were assessed in duplicate at week 1, 3, and 10 by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).",1bfffa5e-ef50-441f-a042-a7a32fbf4cec

Sample size was calculated as n = 30 subjects per group, assuming a 5% decrease in body weight in the IFCR-L group, with a power of 80% and an α risk of 5%. An independent samples t-test was used to test baseline differences between groups. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed, taking time as the within-subject factor and diet as the between-subject factor, to assess differences between groups over the course of the study. Post-hoc analyses were performed using the Tukey test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. All data was analyzed using SPSS software (version 20.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

20,discussion0,"This study is the first to show that IFCR with liquid meals can produce potent decreases in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, and that these effects are mediated in part by improvements in adipokines. More specifically, we show here that IFCR-L is an effective diet therapy to modulate lipid indicators of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, i.e. reduce LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and the proportion of small LDL particles, while increasing LDL peak particle size. Our findings also demonstrate that these favorable changes in lipids were related to reduced waist circumference (visceral fat mass) and reductions in pro-atherogenic adipokines, such as leptin and TNF-alpha.  Although both of the interventions produced favorable changes in lipids, superior modulations were shown in the IFCR-L group when compared to the IFCR-F group. The reductions in plasma lipids by IFCR-L (LDL-cholesterol: 19%, triglycerides: 20%) are similar to what has been reported in previous trials of IF  [2,3].",635604c9-97cc-407c-8fe4-e1c540977570
21,discussion1," For instance, in a trial by Williams et al.  [3], obese subjects consumed a very-low calorie diet (VLCD; <500 kcal/d) 1 day per week, and ate ad libitum every other day of the week. After 20 weeks of treatment, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations decreased by 10% and 52%, respectively  [3]. In the trial by Harvie et al.  [2], obese women underwent 2 days of VLCD (600 kcal/d) and ate ad libitum on every other day of the week, for 24 weeks. Post-treatment LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were reduced by 10% and 17% from baseline  [2]. The mechanism by which IFCR modulates circulating lipid concentrations is not clear. Nonetheless, recent evidence from CR studies indicate that the oxidation of circulating free fatty acids (free fatty acids (FFA)) is increased during periods of weight loss, while free fatty acids (FFA) synthesis is decreased  [18].",0f973d9f-c479-4924-854d-6860d5bdcbf2
22,discussion2," Lower availability of precursor free fatty acids (FFA) results in a reduction in hepatic synthesis and secretion of very-low density lipoprotein (very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)) into plasma. Lower secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) contributes to reduced plasma concentrations of LDL, since very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is quickly converted to LDL in the circulation  [19]. Although this mechanism has only been demonstrated for CR, it possible that IFCR may alter circulating lipids in a similar fashion.  The greater improvement in lipid profile by IFCR-L is most likely due to the more pronounced reductions in body weight and visceral fat mass observed. After 8 weeks of treatment, body weight and waist circumference, an indirect indicator of visceral fat, decreased to a greater extent in the IFCR-L (4 kg and 6 cm, respectively) when compared to the IFCR-F group (3 kg and 4 cm, respectively).",e9c3dc28-c876-4db9-a150-eadb997bcad2
23,discussion3," The greater weight loss by the IFCR-L group is not surprising as these individuals had a larger daily calorie deficit relative to the IFCR-F group (453 kcal/d, 250 kcal/d, respectively). These decreases in waist circumference in the IFCR-L group were related to reductions in LDL cholesterol concentrations. An accumulation of adipose tissue in visceral depots may contribute to the development of dyslipidemia in several ways. For instance, lipolysis of fat tissue in visceral adipocytes is higher than that of subcutaneous adipocytes. This can lead to an augmented efflux of free fatty acids (FFA) from visceral depots  [20]. These free fatty acids (FFA)s released from visceral fat are then collected by the portal vein and reach the liver at much higher concentrations than they do the systemic circulation  [20]. In the liver, these free fatty acids (FFA) trigger the augmented production of triglycerides, and the elevated secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)  [20].",f6ee7744-b86f-48c3-85cd-4b3efe63b035
24,discussion4," The increased secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) then results in higher plasma levels of LDL  [20]. In view of this, it is conceivable that the decrease in visceral fat by IFCR played a role in the reduced LDL cholesterol concentrations shown here.  Decreases in pro-atherogenic adipokines, such as leptin (26%), IL-6 (19%), TNF-alpha (25%), and IGF-1 (10%) were observed by the IFCR-L group. No changes in adipokines were noted in the IFCR-F group, however, which is most likely due to insufficient weight loss to achieve changes in these parameters  [21]. The decreases in leptin noted here are similar to those observed by Harvie et al.  [2]. After 24 weeks of IF, obese women experienced potent reductions in leptin of 40%  [2]. The greater reductions in leptin in this previous trial are most likely due to the greater weight loss achieved with the longer trial duration  [22]. In the IFCR-L group, lower plasma leptin was related to decreased triglyceride levels.",7a6f7386-7aba-40ff-acf2-990903cc2569
25,discussion5," In vitro studies demonstrate that leptin is a potent stimulator of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes and other cell types  [23]. Accordingly, leptin is also a regulator of circulating triacylglycerol concentrations  [23]. Reduced leptin levels were also related to lower LDL cholesterol levels post-treatment, though the mechanism by which leptin may be involved in reducing LDL cholesterol concentrations is not clear. We also observed a positive association between visceral fat mass and leptin levels. Thus, it is possible that the decrease in visceral fat by the IFCR-L intervention stimulated a reduction in leptin, which in turn contributed to the lipid profile improvements demonstrated here. Reductions in TNF-alpha were also correlated to decreases in plasma triglycerides. Evidence in rodent models indicates that TNF-alpha induces hyperlipidemia by increasing hepatic triglyceride production  [24].",4c173090-e67a-4253-bca1-1d57bb41fe0e
26,discussion6," Thus, a reduction in circulating TNF-alpha by IFCR-L may be related to the reductions in triglycerides observed.  This study is limited in that it did not carefully control for food intake by providing food-based meals to the intervention groups, i.e. dinner meal for the IFCR-L group, and 3 meals/d for the IFCR-F group. Providing all the meals during the study would allow for a more precise assessment of dietary adherence. Another disadvantage is that only female subjects were employed, and as such, the applicability of these findings to males remains uncertain.  Taken together, our results suggest that IFCR with liquid meals is an effective diet therapy to reduce body weight, visceral fat mass, and lipid indicators of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Our findings also demonstrate that the beneficial modulations in vascular disease risk by IFCR may be mediated, in part, by reductions in visceral fat mass and pro-atherogenic adipokines.",d6cd7cd7-5044-431a-99e9-9f454738647a
