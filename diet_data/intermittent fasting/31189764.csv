0,introduction0,"Most nutritional health research focuses on altering the quantity and/or type of food consumed. Recent research suggests that the temporal distribution of nutrient intake (chrononutrition) can also play a role in mediating the health effects of a given diet. For instance, restricting the daily energy intake (EI) window to between 4 and 10 h, known as time-restricted feeding (time restricted feeding (TRF)), elicits favorable metabolic effects in rodents independently of energy balance (1–3), which include protection against excessive body weight gain in response to high-fat and high-sucrose diets, reduced serum triglycerides, fasting insulin concentrations and hepatic fat content, and improved glucose tolerance. However, key differences in the adaptive metabolic response to fasting between rodents and humans, including rates of hepatic glycogen depletion (4, 5), may limit the translatability of these findings.",ca42dba2-e419-4b12-ae74-546775b367dc
1,introduction1,"  Studies investigating the effect of time restricted feeding (TRF) in humans have primarily focused on adaptations to resistance training (6–8) and/or only examined fasting metabolism, energy balance, or weight loss (9–11). In a feasibility study, overweight individuals underwent 16 wk of time restricted feeding (TRF), during which they were required to reduce their daily eating duration to 10–12 h, resulting in significant weight loss and improved levels of self-reported sleep satisfaction and energy (12). Furthermore, improvements in glucose tolerance after time restricted feeding (TRF) have been shown in adults who were overweight/obese (13–15). Short-term time restricted feeding (TRF) has also been shown to reduce appetite markers and increase 24-h fat oxidation rates in overweight individuals (16).",140697a6-aaa6-4a47-8d04-9c861bf8db20
2,introduction2," More recently, 12 wk of 10-h time restricted feeding (TRF) in individuals with metabolic syndrome improved markers of cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure and circulating lipids (17). Currently, there is a paucity of research in this area using detailed metabolic measurements during the postprandial period, which comprises most of the waking day. In addition, no studies have examined the effect of time restricted feeding (TRF) on skeletal muscle metabolism, which plays an important role in the disposal of an oral glucose load (18). Moreover, it is plausible that improved skeletal muscle anabolic sensitivity may underpin the preferential reductions in fat mass observed during time restricted feeding (TRF) compared with an energy-matched control diet in humans undertaking resistance training (6).  An additional consideration is the optimal timing of the EI window.",141ccbfc-4454-49f3-8c40-a9f0839c560b
3,introduction3," Diurnal variations in metabolic function, including glucose tolerance, were established several decades ago (19, 20). More recent, randomized crossover studies demonstrate favorable acute metabolic responses to a meal consumed earlier in the day (21, 22), and there is evidence suggesting chronically shifting a greater proportion of EI to earlier in the day may also be beneficial (23, 24). Early time-restricted feeding (etime restricted feeding (TRF)) is a dietary strategy combining these approaches by shifting EI to earlier in the day and extending the length of the overnight fast. A recent supervised, controlled feeding randomized controlled trial found that 5 wk of etime restricted feeding (TRF) improved whole-body insulin sensitivity in individuals with prediabetes independently of weight loss (15). However, metabolic responses were not compared after a matched duration of fast, and the effects of etime restricted feeding (TRF) in a free-living setting have not yet been examined.",f33cf404-45db-4a6c-a3f9-8393f8d38107
4,introduction4," This includes objectively measured physical activity (PA) levels and glycemic variability using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).  The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of 2 wk of free-living etime restricted feeding (TRF) and an energy-matched (restricted) control intervention on markers of whole-body and skeletal muscle insulin and anabolic sensitivity in healthy young men. Secondary aims were to assess the changes in body composition and patterns of PA following 2 wk of intervention. It was hypothesized that, compared with the control, etime restricted feeding (TRF) will confer favorable metabolic benefits during the postprandial period in healthy humans.

5,background0,Altering the temporal distribution of energy intake (EI) and introducing periods of intermittent fasting (IF) exert important metabolic effects. Restricting EI to earlier in the day [early time-restricted feeding (etime restricted feeding (TRF))] is a novel type of IF.  Objectives We assessed the chronic effects of etime restricted feeding (TRF) compared with an energy-matched control on whole-body and skeletal muscle insulin and anabolic sensitivity. ,8a37c5ff-4e67-45d2-bcaa-5f453f747215

8,methods2,"  Experimental design Two experimental groups (matched for sex, age, BMI, and PA) completed a 1-wk baseline period to establish participants’ habitual dietary and PA patterns before they underwent a 2-wk dietary intervention [either etime restricted feeding (TRF) or control/caloric restriction (CON:CR)]. Since imposing restrictions on the length of the daily EI window in free-living individuals consuming an ad libitum diet has been shown to lead to a reduction in EI (25), the etime restricted feeding (TRF) study arm was completed first. This permitted weight loss and the macronutrient composition and caloric content of dietary intake in etime restricted feeding (TRF) to be matched in the control group (CON:CR), which was recruited for separately 9 mo after completion of etime restricted feeding (TRF) (Figure 1). Participants in both intervention groups were instructed to maintain their habitual PA patterns throughout the 2-wk intervention.",feb5a4ee-5365-43d5-9de0-eaca04ef4aea
9,methods3,"  Initially, resting metabolic rate (resting metabolic rate (RMR)) was obtained for all participants following an overnight fast via indirect calorimetry as described below under Pre- and Post-intervention Main Experimental Trials. Participants in both groups also completed a modified incremental treadmill protocol with indirect calorimetry measurements (26) to improve the accuracy of free-living energy expenditure (EE) estimates obtained from a combined heart rate and accelerometer (Actiheart; CamNtech). Subjects were also fitted with a subcutaneous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre; Abbott Diabetes Care), which recorded interstitial glucose concentrations every 15 min, and were instructed to record all EI using daily food diaries during a baseline week to establish the habitual PA and dietary patterns, respectively. CGM and food diaries were also recorded for the entire experimental intervention periods and used to verify adherence to each eating pattern.",bfe3c214-5a47-4861-950b-0ecaf461385a
10,methods4,"  Following the baseline week, participants visited the laboratory to assess their metabolic response to a carbohydrate (carbohydrate (CHO)) and protein liquid test meal (see Pre- and Post-intervention Main Experimental Trials below). From the next day, participants were either asked to restrict their daily EI window to between 08:00 and 16:00 (etime restricted feeding (TRF)) or follow their habitual pattern without altering the temporal distribution of EI (CON:CR). In the former group, participants were encouraged to not consciously alter the type or quantity of food habitually consumed. In the CON:CR group, participants were prescribed dietary plans and provided with all food and beverages that matched the macronutrient composition (45% carbohydrate (CHO), 35% fat, and 20% protein) and caloric content in etime restricted feeding (TRF). Participants in both groups were asked to restrict alcohol consumption to ≤1 unit per day throughout the intervention.",1d023356-e685-4400-95c4-8bd4fae3c2fe
11,methods5," Total daily EE for each participant was estimated using resting metabolic rate (RMR) and personalized PA level (PAL) estimated from accelerometry and heart rate data. The deficit in EI in the CON:CR group was calculated based on the average involuntary reduction observed in the etime restricted feeding (TRF) group and was scaled to the habitual total daily EE (as determined above). By using objective measurements of PA and body mass and composition throughout each intervention, any methodologic limitations of relying on food diaries for the estimation of dietary intake deficits were minimized. After 2 wk, participants in both groups visited the laboratory for a second main experimental trial to undergo identical follow-up metabolic testing.  Pre- and post-intervention main experimental trials Metabolic measurements were undertaken before and for 180 min after consumption of a carbohydrate (CHO) and protein drink.",fa3e3319-f9f7-453a-821c-458cbb22f9dd

Concentrations of serum triglyceride (triglyceride (TAG)) and plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays on a clinical chemistry analyzer (ABX Pentra 400; Horiba). Serum insulin (cat. HI-014K; Merck Millipore) and total plasma ghrelin (cat. GHRT89HK; Merck Millipore) concentrations were determined using solid-phase 125I radioimmunoassay kits, which use the double antibody technique (31).

45,discussion0,"The present study shows that under free-living conditions, 2 wk of etime restricted feeding (TRF) improves whole-body insulin sensitivity and increases postprandial skeletal muscle nutrient (glucose and amino acids) uptake in healthy young men. Importantly, our results suggest these beneficial effects are independent of the changes in body composition and energy balance elicited by a reduction in free-living EI during etime restricted feeding (TRF). Moreover, unlike previous research (15), they represent chronic adaptations to etime restricted feeding (TRF), rather than the acute effect of the last bout of prolonged overnight fast, as the duration of fast prior to metabolic testing was standardized to habitual levels.  The improvement in whole-body insulin sensitivity is evidenced by the lower postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses and higher M-ISI in response to consumption of the carbohydrate (CHO) and protein drink in etime restricted feeding (TRF) compared with CON:CR.",f1366306-ba60-46bd-84e7-ce16f54efd53
46,discussion1," This extends recent findings on overweight men with prediabetes (15) to a healthier population. In contrast, no reductions in fasting insulin were shown, which is in line with previous observations made in males with obesity after a standardized fast (13). However, 8 wk of time restricted feeding (TRF) have previously shown to lower fasting insulin in healthy resistance-trained males (6), suggesting 2 wk may have been insufficient to detect a difference in fasting insulin.  Incorporating protein and dextrose into the oral liquid test challenge permitted simultaneous insight into postprandial skeletal muscle glucose and BCAA uptake, as indices of muscle insulin and anabolic sensitivity, respectively.",6d0b938e-db8b-4fcb-a42a-838f669d0c53
47,discussion2," As no significant differences in blood flow to the muscle were observed between interventions, the elevated glucose uptake in the postprandial period of the etime restricted feeding (TRF) trial (which was particularly prominent in the initial 90 min of it) could be accounted for by improved efficiency of glucose extraction. This is interesting, considering postprandial insulin concentrations were lower in etime restricted feeding (TRF) compared with CON:CR.  The increased skeletal muscle glucose uptake after etime restricted feeding (TRF), compared with CON:CR, was not accompanied by higher whole-body postprandial carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation rates. Muscle glycogen content was also unchanged, suggesting nonoxidative glucose disposal was similar. Muscle Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activation, the rate-limiting step in muscle glucose oxidation, was similar in the basal (fasted) condition and increased in response to consumption of the liquid test meal in both trials.",66f93495-4cf5-4677-aa86-b5ded3d2b4d3
48,discussion3," More pronounced differences in Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activation, and hence muscle glucose oxidation, may have been evident if the postprandial muscle biopsy was obtained earlier than 180 min, when glucose uptake and insulin concentrations were elevated.  Forearm BCAA uptake also increased in response to feeding after 2 wk of etime restricted feeding (TRF) compared with CON:CR, which could be an adaptive mechanism to potentiate the anabolic response to protein ingestion as the body adapts to a shorter EI window. This may partially explain previous observations that time restricted feeding (TRF) promotes improved retention of lean body mass during weight loss in response to resistance training (6), although this was not replicated in this study presumably due to its short-term nature and limited weight loss incurred. Increased uptake of plasma BCAA by skeletal muscle after etime restricted feeding (TRF) in the present study is supported by our data showing a trend (P = 0.",946b39ae-7c52-4c80-af54-813d167b8072
49,discussion4,"10) for increased intramuscular BCAA content after feeding. The metabolic fate (synthesis or oxidation) of these BCAAs remains unknown, although we observed no changes in their keto acids after feeding, which suggests a potential anabolic response. Future studies should address the efficacy of etime restricted feeding (TRF) as a nutritional strategy to better preserve the protein synthetic response to a protein-rich meal and hence lean body mass under conditions of weight loss using stable isotope tracers.  Both prolonging the daily fast and shifting food intake to earlier in the day likely contributed to the underlying metabolic improvements after etime restricted feeding (TRF). Diurnal metabolic responses to nutrients are influenced by the circadian system, and glucose tolerance is higher earlier in the day (19–22).",2f82d95a-17ba-46c6-b34b-42b7cb31bf1e
50,discussion5," Although different EI windows (early compared with late time restricted feeding (TRF)) were not directly compared in the present study, we postulate that chronically shifting nutrient intake to earlier in the day may have beneficial metabolic effects (15, 23–25). Although similar weight loss was induced by both interventions in the present study, there were no obvious metabolic benefits associated with the CON:CR group. The reasons are unclear but could relate to the short-term nature and limited body weight loss incurred in young physically active individuals that is unlikely to alter metabolic health.  Adherence to the etime restricted feeding (TRF) protocol was high, with only 1 reported eating event outside of the stipulated EI window.",aed88199-bc7d-4aa3-a3b9-914a1155c792
51,discussion6," This is further supported by the pronounced differences in glycemic profiles between CON:CR and etime restricted feeding (TRF), with lower mean glucose values evident between 20:00 and 08:00 (reflecting the longer overnight fast) and higher variability during 08:00 and 20:00 in etime restricted feeding (TRF) (reflecting the shorter EI window). To our knowledge, only 1 other study (13) has compared free-living glucose concentrations during a habitual diet and etime restricted feeding (TRF). They also found no change in mean 24-h glucose but a reduction in fasting glucose concentration, defined as the time between 4 h after consumption of the last meal of the day until the time of the first meal of the next day. These findings are broadly comparable to the 20:00 to 08:00 fasting window used in the present study and in agreement with our findings of lower mean glucose values during that period in etime restricted feeding (TRF).",ea1db6be-689c-43d3-9e0d-a41537aadf05
52,discussion7,"  In line with previous research, imposing restrictions on the length of the daily EI window in a free-living setting leads to an involuntary reduction in EI (9, 25, 38). In the present study, this was estimated to be ∼400 kcal·d−1 and, in the absence of changes in objectively quantified PA levels, led to a negative energy balance that resulted in a mean body mass loss of 1.04 ± 0.25 kg over the 2-wk etime restricted feeding (TRF) intervention period. Previous studies objectively measuring PA during time restricted feeding (TRF) showed no changes but were conducted on adults who were overweight/obese, with low baseline PA levels (13, 38). The present study extends these findings to a more physically active population. This contrasts with reductions in PA observed during Ramadan (39, 40) and likely reflects the chronobiologically opposing EI windows used.  A major strength of this study is the comparable weight loss elicited in a control group matched for age, BMI, and PA.",d0a321d0-6103-47db-b58b-a259820bc309
53,discussion8," This was achieved by prescribing a diet matched for macronutrient composition, and importantly, participants did not alter their temporal distribution of EI during CON:CR. Together, these results suggest that the metabolic improvements observed after etime restricted feeding (TRF) are independent of the energy imbalance and small but significant amount of weight lost elicited by a reduction in free-living EI. One limitation of the present study is that only healthy men were recruited, and there may be sex-based differences in responses to intermittent fasting (41). Other limitations include the short-term study duration and the use of self-reported energy intake data to prescribe an energy-matched diet for the CON:CR group. However, by using objective measurements of PA and body composition, any methodologic limitations of relying on food diaries for the estimation of dietary intake deficits were minimized.",d25ed467-f28a-4e05-a74d-8501bbe7f73d
54,discussion9," Those measurements also confirmed that the participants complied with the requirements of the study, including the voluntary energy deficit imposed on the participants in the CON:CR group.  In summary, the present study highlights skeletal muscle as an important tissue modulating the beneficial effects of etime restricted feeding (TRF) on postprandial insulin and anabolic sensitivity in healthy men. Although improvements in insulin sensitivity are likely more relevant to clinical populations at an increased susceptibility to metabolic disease(s), even in healthy individuals, insulin sensitivity is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular disease (42, 43). Our results suggest that etime restricted feeding (TRF) would lead to a natural reduction to EI and augment the insulin-sensitizing effect of the accompanying weight loss.",7574ad87-04e8-43af-9dcf-2a03f26b2223
55,discussion10," This suggests etime restricted feeding (TRF) has potential applications as an alternative to calorie counting and may provide a simplistic, accessible dietary intervention. However, larger-scale research studies are necessary to address its feasibility in the longer term. While research suggests etime restricted feeding (TRF) may confer additional metabolic benefits over other intermittent fasting approaches, direct comparisons between different eating windows are necessary to guide practical dietary strategies.
