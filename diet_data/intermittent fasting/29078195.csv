0,introduction0,"Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both important risk factors for life threatening diseases that can target cardiovascular and hepatic systems [1, 2]. The prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome is a reality for developed countries, which began more than two decades ago [3]. Today, the incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome is rapidly increasing in developing countries as well [4], leading to increased morbidity and mortality due to type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease [5, 6]. Recently, global climate change was implicated in the onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes due to the negative impact of higher temperatures on energy metabolism [7, 8]. This means that the overall prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome tends to aggravate in the next few years in pair with reduced physical activity [9].",d2715e6a-63d7-4431-a481-d377d098e487
1,introduction1,"  Intermittent fasting (IF) regimens and high-intensity intermittent exercise (high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE)) are two natural strategies to prevent and mitigate obesity related diseases [10, 11]. An every-other-day IF regimen was recently demonstrated by Li, Xie [12] to dramatically reduce obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis in rodents. The effects observed by IF were mimicked, in part, by transplantation of gut microbiota from an animal under IF to another animal with food ad libitum. On the other hand, the adaptations promoted by high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in rodents has been demonstrated to have a direct effect on the body parts recruited during the activity (e.g. skeletal muscles [13]) and an additional global effect in some organs like liver [14] and heart [15]. Both IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) approaches are appropriate treatments for obesity-related problems in humans [16, 17].",1cba58f5-1b9e-43e0-9dfd-acc01ff20530
2,introduction2," To note, IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) strategies, respectively, resemble the evolution patterns of the human diet [18], namely an erratic food availability and the high-intensity intermittent exercise analogous to hunting/gathering activities [19].  Since IF can produce different adaptations compared to high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE), and the combination of both was recently demonstrated to increase skeletal muscle mRNA levels of NRF1, NRF2, Tfam, hepatic mRNA level of PGC1-alpha, and plasmatic level of glucose-6-phosphate [20], we reasoned that IF associated with high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) could have an additive or a synergistic effect in energy metabolism involving mitochondrial reprogramming and hexokinase (HK) modulation. The activity of HK is closely connected with mitochondrial activity since the muscular isoform of this enzyme can bind to the mitochondrial membrane through VDAC [21].",e3620a1d-017e-46e7-9f64-4a492bd9b718
3,introduction3," This binding is described to positively modulate the activities of both HK and VDAC [22]. Additionally, we centered our assessment on HK, as this enzyme is known to be essential for overcoming the rate-limiting steps of glucose metabolism [23] and oxidative phosphorylation [24].  Material and methods Animals and intermittent fasting protocol All animal procedures performed received prior approval from the Animal Use Ethical Committee in the Health Science Center of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Protocol CEUA/EEFD06). At the beginning of the adaptation phase, twenty-four (6 animals/group) 60-day-old male Wistar rats weighing 262 ± 22 g were obtained from Biotério Central (Health Science Center of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and housed in a climate-controlled environment (22.8 ± 2.0 °C, 45–50% humidity) with a 12/12–light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum.",24ecd03d-1e05-45c7-b64c-d4efaf927972

The chow given to the animals was a standard laboratory chow Nuvilab CR-1 (Nuvital Nutrientes, Paraná, Brazil) with 22% protein, 8% fibers, and 4% fat. Animals in the control (C) and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) groups had access to food ad libitum during all the study while those in the IF and IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) groups were subjected to an every-other-day IF regimen.",5d33543d-0903-4810-ae10-9795e61a547d

Animals were weighed weekly in the morning before the withdrawal or reintroduction of food. Food consumption was evaluated daily and the intermittent fasting resulted in a 15% reduction in total offered calories. Importantly, at the beginning of the study, the animals had already reached 90 days of age (young adults), thus avoiding influences of sexual maturation (30–40 days of age) [25] and musculoskeletal development [26] in our analyzes.",21895987-4435-48d1-b042-e057e20f5e28
6,introduction6,"  High intensity intermittent exercise protocol and physical tests (PTs) The groups high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) performed 8 weeks of an interval swimming exercise consisting of 14 repeated 20-second swimming bouts with weight (equivalent to percent body weight (bw)) attached with 10 seconds rest between the repeats as described previously [27]. Before the beginning of the study, animals were adapted one week to the aquatic conditions by performing the exercise without an overload. An initial overload of 6% of the bw was attached to the animal during the swimming period. The load was increased by 2% bw every two weeks. The high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) protocol was performed exclusively on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays during the protocol adaptation and continued during the 8 weeks of the study. This routine was employed to avoid overtraining the animals.",31d9c0dd-ba3a-4495-9fdb-0451a1821412
7,introduction7," PTs were used to determine changes in cardiorespiratory endurance in the animals. Each test consists of the measurement of swimming until fatigue time under a 12% bw overload, that was applied on three separate occasions: (1st) one day before day 0, (2nd) at day 28, and (3rd) at day 56 (Fig 1). Fatigue was characterized when the animal failed to rise to the water surface to breathe within a 12 second period (counted with a chronometer when the animal was 10 cm below the surface).  10.1371/journal.pone.0202784.g001Fig 1 Graphical representation of the experimental design.

Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IGTT)) The animals were fasted for 12 hrs prior to the administration of an intraperitoneal injection of glucose (2 g/kg bw). Blood samples were drawn from the tail vein immediately before the glucose challenge, as well as 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min thereafter. Blood glucose levels were determined using an Accu-Chek glucose analyzer (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland). The area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) was calculated from glycemic curves over time using Prism 7.0 (Graph Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

Tissue collection and preparation Heart, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, brown adipose tissue and visceral fat were rapidly removed from animals euthanized by decapitation 2 days after the last day of the experimental period (56 days) and weighed. All organs and tissues weights were normalized by the total bw (last bw measured before euthanasia) of the animals of origin (Fig 2). For enzymatic analysis and NADH measurements, tissues were homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem in homogenization buffer (30 mM KCl, 4 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with the protease inhibitors aprotinin and PMSF).

12,introduction12,"  Determination of fiber cross-sectional area Frozen gastrocnemius histological sections (5μm) were obtained in Leica CM 1850 Cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany), fixed with 4% formal calcium and stained with the hematoxylin and eosin (HE) method. We captured images of the stained sections with a Leica DM 2500 optical microscope (20 x lens) (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany). One hundred and fifty myofibers from 3 fields (50 fibers per field) per animal (n = 3) per group were selected and the fiber cross-sectional area was measured using Image J 1.51n software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). A total of 150 myofibers were plotted for each animal to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the total fiber number [28].  Hexokinase activity The method to measure enzymatic activity was adapted from one described previously [29]. The enzymatic activity was performed at 37 °C in a buffer containing 4 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM glucose (0.",b8e0a917-f991-4e28-997d-001f4f34660f

Oxidative profile measurements The oxidative profile of skeletal muscle was determined through the measurement of its mitochondrial NADH content by its fluorescence (reviewed in Mayevsky and Barbiro-Michaely [30]). Briefly, 140 μg of protein from a muscle sample homogenate derived from each animal was placed into a 96 well plate and excited at 340 nm. The emission at 450 nm was measured in a Spectramax Paradigm (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

O2 consumption was measured using the high-resolution Oxygraph-2k system (Oroboros Instruments GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria). The results were normalized to the wet weight of the permeabilized fiber bundles. All the experiments were performed at 37 °C in a 2 ml chamber. Mitochondria membrane permeability was tested by the addition of 10 μM cytochrome c. No greater than a 10% increase in oxygen consumption was observed.

FoF1 ATP synthase activity assay in skeletal muscle The ATP synthase activity was extrapolated from ATP hydrolysis (ATPase) activity described previously [32]. Briefly, 50 μg of protein from gastrocnemius homogenate from each animal was used to measure ATPase activity in 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris (pH 8,5) buffer in the presence or absence of 5 mM sodium azide at 37 °C. After TCA precipitation (20% w/v) and centrifugation (3000 x g for 15 minutes at 4 °C) the resultant supernatant was collected and combined with ammonium molybdate and Fiske-Subbarow reducer.

19,results0,"The effect of IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) on body composition To determine the adaptive changes on energetic metabolism and physical performance induced by IF, high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE), and their combination (IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE)), the three regimens were imposed on age-matched young adult Wister rats over 8 weeks (Fig 1). Over the course of the experimental conditions, the weight of the animals was tracked weekly and plotted in a curve (Fig 2A). The cumulative increase in the weight of animals on an ad libitum diet (C and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) groups) is very apparent and the prevention of excessive weight gain in animals under IF protocol (IF and IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) groups) is evident; other groups observed a similar effect [12, 18].",22939359-5037-4748-a28f-a7611c713080
20,results1," To explore the possible origin of the observed differences in the weight of the groups, organs and tissues were collected and weighed at the end of the study. The organs and tissue weight values were normalized by total body mass of the animal of origin. Initially, we weighed the brown adipose tissue (BAT, Fig 2B) and the visceral fat (Fig 2C) of the animals. Our results demonstrate that IF combined with high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) can induce an increase in BAT mass; the statistical evaluation pointed to a contribution of both IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in the result. Differently, IF alone was responsible for the lower visceral fat weight. The latter was also observed by Li et al. [12]. No modifications were observed in the liver (Fig 2D) and heart (Fig 2E) normalized weights. An increase in skeletal muscle mass (gastrocnemius) (Fig 2F) was observed in IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE).",c9a8b400-656d-46dc-9e73-984beedba70a
21,results2," In this case, only the high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) contribution was observed. Interestingly, the evaluation of cross-sectional area (cross sectional area (CSA)) confirmed the hypertrophic effect of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) (Fig 2F and 2G), but also demonstrate a clear synergistic effect of IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) (ANOVA p < 0.05 for interaction), while the measurement of cross sectional area (CSA) from IF demonstrates an atrophic tendency (p = 0.08).  IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) impact on glucose metabolism The effect observed above in the body composition could be explained by an intensive reprograming of energetic metabolism. To investigate the effects of IF, high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and the combination of both on energetic metabolism, we initiated the measurement of general indicators of glucose metabolism and predictive factors for insulin sensitivity [35, 36].",ec8dc1ac-24c2-4bf0-9655-8b59c8ed9c1a
22,results3," We measured the fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance (Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IGTT)) and fasting plasma insulin levels (Fig 3). All groups presented similar values for fasting blood glucose (Fig 3A) and the glucose tolerance test showed some dissimilarities between groups, most notably before 60 min (Fig 3B). To better scrutinize the glucose tolerance curves, we measured the area under the curve (AUC), revealing that IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) poses an enhancement of glucose tolerance (Fig 3C). The statistical evaluation revealed a contribution of IF along with the contribution of an interaction between IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE), evidencing a synergistic effect. In contrast, the fasting insulin level (Fig 3D) experienced an influence mainly by IF with an additive effect of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE).",825d7090-ff5a-40a1-94ce-7398fc2f8967

24,results5," Individual effects (IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE)) and the effect of their interaction were verified by two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons; p values were annotated.  By treating rat thymocytes with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, phorbol and mannoheptulose, Naftalin and Rist demonstrated that HK activity is integrated with the sugar transporter [37]. Based on this mechanism, we hypothesized that the enhanced glucose tolerance combined with low insulin levels observed above could be, in part, explained by an augmented HK activity in multiple organs (Fig 4). To test this we aimed to evaluate the activity of low Km isoforms of HK (I and II) present in the liver, heart and gastrocnemius [38, 39].",d9cf07a6-dee6-4825-83ee-7b7b2fbdaf98

In the heart, the main effect in HK catalytic activation was produced by IF alone (Fig 4B). Strikingly, in the skeletal muscle (Fig 4C), high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) promoted a strong contribution for HK activity (3-fold increase in high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE)), but the interaction maximized the catalytic activation (6-fold increase in IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE)).

27,results8,"  IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) synergistic effect in physical activity and energy production The effect of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) on promoting physiological adaptation in skeletal muscle is well described [14, 40]. However, the effect of IF combined with high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in physical performance is not, although some reports that employed endurance training suggest a possible additive effect: I) Rodriguez-Bies et al. combined IF protocol with endurance exercises and observed a consistent increase in beta-oxidation, lactate production and mitochondria content in the gastrocnemius with a modest effect on physical performance in animals submitted to both protocols compared to the control group [41].

However, the physical capacity of these animals was not evaluated in the latter.",6dbe4701-dab7-4ef6-9323-e88af2d68699
28,results9," To investigate a possible improvement of physical endurance promoted by IF and/or high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) along the experimental procedures, we submitted all groups to a PT on three days (Fig 5A): 1st) one day before day 0; 2nd) at day 28; 3rd) at day 56 (end of the IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) protocols). The 3rd test revealed a higher endurance of animals in the high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) groups that was approximately 90% and 180% in comparison to the control group, respectively. The possibility that the weights of the animals from the IF and IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) groups were contributing to the outcome of the PT was eliminated since no correlation was observed between swimming time and the weights of the animals in any of the PTs (S2 Fig).  10.1371/journal.pone.0202784.g005Fig 5 PT and energy production.

30,results11,"  Furthermore, to explore any possible adaptation that granted the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group the best results in the PT, we measured the activity of the FoF1 ATP synthase in the skeletal muscle of these animals (Fig 5B). We observed approximately 50% increase in FoF1 activity in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group compared to the other groups; contribution from high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and from interaction in the result were observed. According to the literature, both IF [41] and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) [43, 44] alone could promote adaptations in mitochondria. To have a general overview of mitochondria electron transport chain in skeletal muscle, we employed a comparative method that uses tissue NAD(P)H autofluorescence [30] to indirectly evaluate oxidation rate profile of the groups (Fig 5C).",6b28e2d1-59c6-463c-929f-2da5e2e72919

Only the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group presented statistically significant lower levels of NAD(P)H with a contribution from high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and from interaction in the result, like those observed in FoF1 activity (Fig 5B). The lower level of NAD(P)H measured in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group suggests a higher mitochondrial oxidation rate in comparison with other groups.

32,results13,"  Synergistic effect of IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in muscle fiber mitochondria respiratory states To investigate how the skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory complexes could be affected by the IF and/or high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) protocols and to help understand the above results, we measured the different respiratory states and the mitochondria respiratory control rate (respiratory control rate (RCR)) (Fig 6). respiratory control rate (RCR) is an reliable indicator of mitochondrial function, as high respiratory control rate (RCR) usually indicates healthy mitochondria and low respiratory control rate (RCR) usually indicates mitochondrial dysfunction [46]. Initially, we analyzed muscle fiber mitochondria oxygen consumption in the presence of complex I substrate, complex II substrate, and ADP (State 3).",b1a601ff-3596-4995-919f-3f888d4621d1
33,results14," We observed a higher O2 flux rate related to ATP production in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group, followed by both the high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and IF groups individually, in comparison to the C group (Fig 6A). The individual contribution of IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) to the observed effect as well the additive effect of IF plus high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) are evident. Subsequently, we added an ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin (State 4o). The high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group presented a higher O2 flux (Fig 6B), indicative of increased proton leakage and/or extra-mitochondrial O2 consumption. In contrast, the IF and IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) groups presented a lower O2 flux in comparison to the C group (Fig 6B). Next, FCCP was added to uncouple the O2 flux from ATP production (State uncoupled).",16132a11-55b6-40f1-b974-55c1d8fc5958
34,results15," The IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group presented higher values in comparison with the other groups (Fig 6C), indicative of an augmented number of respiratory complexes and/or mitochondrial mass. The respiratory control rate (RCR) calculated values were greatest in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group followed by the IF group, both of which were significantly greater than the values of the C and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) groups that were nearly equal (Fig 6D).  10.1371/journal.pone.0202784.g006Fig 6 IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) promotes mitochondria activation in permeabilized skeletal muscle fiber bundles. Respiration measurements were performed on gastrocnemius fiber bundles using a high-resolution respirometry. The results were normalized to the wet weight of the permeabilized fiber bundles.

State uncoupled was measured in the sequence of state 3 and state 4o through addition of FCCP.

Individual effects (IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE)) and the effect of their interaction were verified by two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons; p values were annotated.  The results above are indicative of an improved O2 flux and ATP production coupling in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and IF groups. The respiratory profile of the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group resembles data from a different group that showed an augmented mass of mitochondrial in skeletal muscle using a dissimilar exercise protocol [41].,5c148dec-2319-4667-9d50-4e13039384ad
36,results17," Finally, the greater respiratory control rate (RCR) value agrees with a more oxidative profile and active FoF1 synthase that was observed exclusively in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group. Additionally, the values observed in State 4o, State uncoupled and respiratory control rate (RCR) for the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group mitochondria clearly demonstrate an IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) interaction effect on these results that corroborate the proposed synergism of IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE).  Overall oxidative stress markers are reduced in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group High intensity exercise was clearly demonstrated to negatively modulate the muscular redox state with a resultant increase in lipid peroxidation [47].",72fee2f2-4311-4353-9db3-9e0476139cd3
37,results18," However, the adoption of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) models was also shown to induce positive effects in muscular physiology (reviewed in MacInnis and Gibala [48]). We hypothesized that in addition to local effects promoted by high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in skeletal muscle, this regimen could also affect the overall redox state with a modulation in oxidative stress markers and, in combination with IF, could possibly generate an additive or a synergistic effect.  To investigate the effect of IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in the overall redox state, we measured plasma oxidative stress damage markers level: lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation through malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde (MDA)) quantification and protein carbonyl content, respectively.",104839b4-bd1c-4a03-a7a6-d4babce3bdb8
38,results19," We observed a strong reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group (Fig 7A); contribution of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) interaction was detected in the result. The latter suggests a synergism between IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in lipid peroxidation prevention. Furthermore, the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group presented lower levels of plasma protein oxidation followed by the high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group (Fig 7B). The statistical analysis demonstrates a strong contribution of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) with a small additive effect of IF in the result. The global observation of oxidative stress markers reveals that IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) could promote synergistic (Fig 7A) and additive (Fig 7B) effects.  10.1371/journal.pone.0202784.",0b8a384b-2156-4fd8-b08e-08af37203532

40,discussion0,"Over the last years, IF [10, 49] or high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) [50, 51] protocols were individually evaluated for their potential to promote energy metabolism and physiologic adaptations. Different combinations of fasting regimens with a variety of exercise protocols were also employed [52], however, none of these studies has examined the interaction between IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) accurately. Recently, researchers have begun to dissect the mechanisms underlying IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) adaptations: For IF, some of the key changes are high circulating levels of acetate (serum) combined with genetic reprograming of white adipose tissue (UCP1, MCT1 and Glut4) [12], whereas for high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) a proteomic change has been proposed for skeletal muscle cells that are especially noticeable in mitochondria and ribosome protein profiles [53].",53ab931c-50cb-4c06-a8fc-063f652f3d7f
41,discussion1," These discoveries shed new light on IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE), thus motivating us to investigate a potential additive effect from the combination of these strategies.  Aiming to generate as little impact in the animals’ stress level as possible, and to avoid an initial overeating (IF group—non-fasting day) impact on exercise execution, we initially chose to include a long adaptation time for the distinct protocols, thus avoiding any misleading precipitate result. Afterwards, the protocols were maintained for 2 months, giving us the opportunity to observe some important effects that were not observed in a concurrent work published recently [20]. We also evaluated the relative contribution of each protocol (IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE)) in our results and surprisingly identified synergism between the protocols in addition to the additive effects published elsewhere.",92221989-3323-4d8c-8391-8d540b2ce428
42,discussion2,"  We identified different contributions of IF or/and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in the body composition. IF was mainly responsible for lowering visceral fat. On the other hand, high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) was mainly responsible for increasing skeletal muscle mass. These IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) individual effects are well established, however, the combination of both promoted a synergistic effect: BAT and skeletal muscle hypertrophy (cross sectional area (CSA)). The synergistic effect of IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in improving skeletal muscle hypertrophy (mass and cross sectional area (CSA)) was completely unexpected, in contrast to the effect on BAT that was already observed in animals under IF in combination with other exercise protocol [42].  Interestingly, BAT and skeletal muscle are very responsive to variations in plasma glucose and insulin levels [54, 55].",acbf1c26-d9e5-415b-ba97-9231df043b95
43,discussion3," This means that understanding the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) effects on glucose metabolism could give us a hint on the source of the observed adaptation in the body composition. However, the fasting blood glucose values from our animals remained largely unaltered (~88 mg/dl), in contrast to the data from the concurrent group using IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) [20]. Their groups presented blood glucose levels very different from our measurements: C and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) with ≥ 140 mg/dl, IF with ≤ 130 mg/dl, and IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) with ≤ 120 mg/dl. These divergent values complicate the comparison between our works. Next, we applied Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IGTT) to evaluate peak plasma glucose elevation and recovery of glucose levels in the different groups.",77a50efe-e06a-471e-b7b3-0c13abda3421
44,discussion4," The IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group had the better result in Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IGTT), emphasized by the area under the curve (AUC) measurement that revealed a synergism between IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE). A similar Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IGTT) result was obtained by Marosi et al. [20]. Additionally, we measured the fasting plasma insulin levels and observed a strong decrease of insulin levels in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group (53% reduction), resulting from an additive effect between IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE).  To investigate the consequences of the observed modulation in glucose metabolism combined with low levels of circulating insulin, we measured the activity of the low Km HKs, whose expression are not controlled by feed/starve state, like HK IV [38].",ecd281fe-710b-4d3d-ba41-afb71a04e8ee
45,discussion5," We observed an additive effect of IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in liver HK and in heart HK activity enhancement. In contrast, skeletal muscle HK activity was modulated by high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) (3.5 fold) and interaction of IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) (6.2 fold), the latter corroborating the synergistic effect seen above. In our assay proposal and data interpretation, we assumed that the glucose transport was not impaired by any of our protocols, especially the Glut4 signaling that is described to be upregulated in IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and in a series of variations of the latter protocols [56, 57].  The HK activity is closely related to mitochondrial activity, since the muscular isoform of this enzyme can bind to the mitochondrial membrane through VDAC [21], a binding that can positively modulate the activities of both [22].",7888e84e-132a-43cf-9db5-41d04d558cbd
46,discussion6," In our work we measured the HK in a mitochondria-rich fraction, and we observed an increased HK activity combined with an increased FoF1 activity in skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius), culminating with the best result for IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) in the physical endurance test. Additionally, we interpreted the oxidative rate profiles comparing NAD(P)H autofluorescence in muscle homogenates from different groups and observed a higher oxidation rate in the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group. The latter could be explained by an increased activity of mitochondrial complex I, as partially demonstrated by Marosi et al. (by western blot) in their IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) group [20].",abb35cbb-1242-447d-8096-04addc1aabf7
47,discussion7," To measure the contribution of IF or/and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) on mitochondrial metabolism, we measured the oxygen consumption in the different groups in the following respiratory states: State 3, where statistical analysis revealed additive effect of IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE), and State 4o, State uncoupled and respiratory control rate (RCR), where statistical analysis revealed IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) interaction effect. This suggest that the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) synergism can promote mitochondrial coupling and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. The indication of mitochondria coupling corroborates the observed FoF1 increased activity.  The correlation between mitochondria and free radicals is well established (review in Gutierrez et al. [58]).",c5c6c6e1-b259-4192-b484-d0c8c62c9699
48,discussion8," Additionally, we demonstrate that IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) synergism modulates mitochondria physiology, promoting more oxidative mitochondria. The latter effect could increase the generation of superoxide that can culminate in damage in lipids and proteins [59]. We observed similar patterns of result for the two oxidative damage markers (malondialdehyde (MDA) and Carbonyl), the overall result reflects the cumulative adaptations promoted by high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) that can be furthered by combination with IF promoting synergistic or additive effects.  To further discuss the adaptations promoted by IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE), as described above, that produced animals with low insulin levels, BAT and skeletal muscle hypertrophy as well as highly active skeletal muscle HK and indications of more coupled mitochondria, we should include in the equation the new role of myostatin observed in metabolism control.",38750d96-437b-44e7-aa7b-0dc906ed751c
49,discussion9," The tissue specific blockage of activin/myostatin axis in rats promoted the development of low insulin level in these animals accompanied with resistance to fat accumulation [60]. An unsuspected BAT-muscle crosstalk driven by myostatin was revealed recently in mice [61]. Additionally, treatment of cancer cells with myostatin promoted VDAC1 upregulation combined with downregulation and mitochondrial dissociation of HK [62]. The growing number of different lines of evidence has put the activin/myostatin axis onto our radar for investigation and we should address their role in IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) adaptation in the near future.",d066072f-ecdb-443c-ae48-db29e8d321d4
50,discussion10,"  Finally, though the data presented here, the IF/high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) protocol arises as a reasonable approach to be employed for translational investigation in humans, especially when considering the evolutionary-based proposal to combine IF and high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) to mimic erratic food behavior and occasional high-intensity energy demand of the gathering/hunting activities of our ancestors to improve metabolism. Different factors influence exercise tolerance and fasting allowance in human population (especially with relation to age and health status), thus high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and IF protocols must be adapted accordingly.
