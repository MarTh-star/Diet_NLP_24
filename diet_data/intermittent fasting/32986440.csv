12,methods12,"  Result  Intermittent Fasting Inhibits Atherosclerosis Progression  LDL catabolism through the activation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR)-/- mice were scheduled continuous HFD feeding or cycles of a modified IF HFD feeding which consists of 3 days HFD feeding and 1 day fasting. The treatment lasted for 7 or 14 weeks (Figure 1A). We determined the food intake in each cycle and found the average food intake to be reduced by ∼20% by IF HFD feeding (Figure 1B).  FIGURE 1 Inhibition of atherosclerosis in LDL catabolism through the activation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR)−/− mice by intermittent fasting treatment. (A) (experimental design): LDL catabolism through the activation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR)−/− mice were divided into four groups (n = 6), and received the following treatment for 7 or 14 weeks: Control groups, mice were fed HFD ad libitum; intermittent fasting (IF) groups, mice were fed HFD in cycles of 3-day HFD feeding and 1-day fasting.",9dcbf971-e34e-46e8-8639-0a385976ea48

As shown in Figure 1C, compared with continuous HFD feeding, the en face lesions were reduced by 40 and 16% after 7 weeks and 14 weeks IF HFD feeding, respectively. We also determined the sinus lesions in aortic root were significantly reduced by ∼35 and 24% after 7 and 14 weeks IF, respectively (Figure 1D).",37571b59-bd97-4c18-810b-f88031ae5f22
14,methods14," Taken together, the data in Figure 1 indicate that IF can alleviate HFD-induced atherosclerosis.  Intermittent Fasting Increases Plaque Stability  The composition of plaques, such as collagen content, size of necrotic cores, and thickness of fibrous caps, can affect plaque vulnerability. The results of HE staining demonstrate that necrotic cores, which contain cholesterol crystal and apoptotic foam cells derived from macrophages and/or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), were reduced by IF (Figures 2A,C; left panels of 2B and D). In contrast, the thickness of fibrous caps (Figures 2A,C), which mainly consists of VSMCs and extracellular matrix to cover necrotic cores, was increased by the IF (right panels of Figures 2B,D).  FIGURE 2 Intermittent fasting increases lesion plaque stability. The aortic root cross sections were used to complete the following assays: HE staining (A,C) with the quantitative analysis of necrotic core and fibrous cap areas (B,D).",6bfc0419-342c-4dd1-935f-c86959ded9d3

The expression of SMA and CD68 (E,F) in plaques were determined by immunofluorescent staining with the quantification of SMA- or CD68-positive areas. *p < 0.05 (n = 6).  VSMC is the major cell type in fibrotic caps and synthesizes/secretes extracellular matrix to stabilize lesions. We determined that SMA, a contractile VSMC marker, was elevated in the atherosclerotic plaques of the IF group (Figure 2E). Macrophage/foam cells were the main cell types within plaques and the component of necrotic cores. Macrophage/foam cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to reduce lesion plaque stability. CD68 expression (the marker of macrophages) was substantially decreased by IF (Figure 2F).",433aa87d-9c15-418a-a724-08290af09100
16,methods16,"  The increased positive area of Picrosirius red staining indicates that the collagen content in the arteries of mice in the IF group is more than the control group (Figures 3A,B). Indeed, the expression of collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL3A1, were increased by IF in the lesion areas and aortas (Figures 3C,E). However, the MMP2 and MMP9, enzymes to degrade extracellular matrix, were not affected by IF (Figures 3D,E).

After 2 weeks HFD feeding ad libitum or IF treatment, the mice aorta samples were collected. The expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, MMP2, and MMP9 were determined by qRT-PCR. *p < 0.05, ns: not significant (n = 6).  Taken together, the results in Figures 2, 3 show that IF potentially increases plaque stability by increasing collagen and VSMC content, while decreasing necrotic cores and macrophage/foam cell content.  Intermittent Fasting Lowers Cholesterol Levels by Inhibiting Liver Cholesterol Synthesis  Serum TC and LDL-C levels are the most important risk factors for atherosclerosis. We determined both TC and LDL-C levels were significantly decreased in IF groups while HDL-C levels were not affected (Figure 4). Meanwhile, serum TG levels were also reduced in the 14 weeks IF group (right panel, Figure 4B).",7fc9329a-b7e6-448c-825d-2423d117a599

Ctrl: control; IF: intermittent fasting.  The liver is the main tissue for cholesterol synthesis/metabolism. Around 70–80% cholesterol is synthesized by the liver (Hotta and Chaikoff, 1955).

19,methods19," As shown in Figure 5A, the liver color turned pale and many vacuoles formed from lipid droplets after HE staining were seen in mice with continuous HFD feeding, particularly after 14 weeks of HFD feeding, suggesting the marked lipid accumulation in the liver. However, either liver color or morphology appears normal in IF groups. Quantitative analysis shows that the liver TG levels were substantially increased by the longer HFD feeding (∼3.5-fold, 7 week HFD vs. 14 week HFD), and the increase was potently blocked by IF (∼50%, left panels of Figure 5B). Interestingly, liver cholesterol levels were also significantly reduced by IF regardless of the time of treatment (right panel, Figure 5B). Furthermore, we determined that serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aminotransferase (AST) levels, two indicators for liver functions, were comparable between the control and IF groups (Figure 5C).",d705725d-5646-4ace-a9f8-c9f158dd2351

21,methods21," To uncover the mechanisms, we determined changes in genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis, transport, and metabolism in the liver. Compared with continuous HFD feeding, the feeding with the IF reduced expression of hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) and HMGC synthase (HMGCS), particularly hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limited enzyme in cholesterol synthesis (Figure 5D). The key transcriptional factor controlling hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) expression, SREBP2, was also slightly reduced (Figure 5D). However, expression of the genes involved in cholesterol transport (ABCA1, ABCG1/5/8, and SR-BI), cholesterol metabolism (CYP7A1), and apolipoprotein B/E (apoB and apoE) in LDL catabolism through the activation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR)-/- mice were not affected by IF (Figure 5E).",7b84b101-352e-4ab4-a3b0-12048c236575
22,methods22," Therefore, the data in Figures 4, 5 suggest that IF ameliorated hypercholesterolemia is mainly attributed to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver.  Intermittent Fasting Suppresses CCL2 Expression  Accumulating studies have demonstrated that atherosclerosis is also a chronic inflammatory disease. Surprisingly, we determined that serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IFN-γ, were not affected by IF. However, serum CCL2 levels were significant reduced by IF for either 7- or 14-week treatment (Figure 6A). CCL2 is a chemokine that attracts monocytes to the target site. Therefore, we determined CCL2 expression in plaques via immunofluorescence staining. Consistent with reduced CCL2 in serum, CCL2 expression was also significantly reduced by IF in lesions (Figures 6B,C).  FIGURE 6 Intermittent fasting suppresses CCL2 expression. (A): mouse serum CCL2, IL-1β, and IFN-γ levels were determined by the ELISA kits.",673c822c-0e00-4fcf-92e0-c681cc2081d1

Intermittent Fasting Reduces Circulating Monocytes and the Adhesion to Endothelium  Considering decreased CCL2 levels in serum and plaques and CD68-positive cells in lesions, we speculated that IF might affect circulating monocyte distribution and its adhesion to endothelium. Therefore, we conducted IF treatment on LDL catabolism through the activation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR)-/- mice for 2 weeks. At the end of the experiment, we collected mouse blood samples to determine the population of immune cells. The Ly6Chigh cells were significantly reduced by IF (Figures 7A,B), indicating the treatment can reduce pro-inflammatory monocytes.

24,methods24," LDL catabolism through the activation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR)−/− mice were divided into the control or IF groups (n = 6/group). After 2 weeks of HFD feeding ad libitum or IF treatment, mouse peripheral blood and aorta samples were collected. Monocytes and T cells in blood samples were determined by FACS.

In addition to monocytes, T cells can also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. However, we found CD3+ T cells were not significantly affected by IF (Figure 7C), while CD4+ nor CD8+ T cells were not changed either (Figure 7D).  At the initial stage of atherosclerosis, accumulated LDL in endothelium stimulates ECs to express/release adhesion factors and chemokines, which can attract circulating monocytes to adhere and migrate to the underneath of intima, where they can differentiate into macrophages. The reduced Ly6Chigh cells by IF treatment (Figures 7A,B) suggests the adhesion of pro-inflammatory monocytes may also be reduced.",72ffdba2-a1e7-49d1-ab61-c929b3571879
26,methods26," To determine this, we collected mouse arch aorta, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta after 2-week IF to evaluate their monocyte adhesion capacity. As shown in Figure 7G, compared with continuous HFD feeding, the adhesion of CFSE-labeled THP-1 monocytic cells to different segments of the aorta was significantly reduced by IF treatment (Figures 7F,G). The adhesion of monocytes to endothelium was mediated by adhesion factors. Indeed, the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was reduced by IF in the atherosclerotic plaques (Figure 7H). Taken together, Figure 7 shows that IF can reduce circulating pro-inflammatory monocytes and adhesion of these cells to endothelium, another anti-atherogenic mechanisms of IF treatment.

27,discussion0," The proper fasting has been demonstrated to maintain fitness and decrease the risk factors of CVD and diabetes (Varady and Hellerstein, 2007; Andersen and Fernandez, 2013; Chen et al., 2016). However, the limited studies determined the effect of IF on CVD with mixed results. Some studies indicate IF can reduce the risk factors for CVD, such as serum lipid profiles and inflammatory cytokines. We previously reported that ∼40% calorie restriction inhibited atherosclerosis via attenuating body weight gain, improving lipid profiles, and inhibiting the expression of inflammatory molecules in lesions . In current study, we found that IF treatment significantly reduced lesions in the en face aorta or aortic root. In addition, it enhanced plaque stability by reducing necrotic cores and macrophage accumulation and increasing fibrotic cap thickness/collagen and SMC content. However, a previous study by Dorighello et al.",202055db-09d2-4e45-91b7-5a0c856c4905
28,discussion1," (2014) demonstrated that alternate-day fasting induced obesity and diabetes, and worsened the development of spontaneous atherosclerosis in LDL catabolism through the activation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR)-/- mice. The contradictory results with our study may be caused by methodological reasons in which Dorighello et al. fed the mice with normal chow, while we fed mice with HFD. The spontaneous development of atherosclerosis is slow, and the lesion was at an early asymptomatic stage. The early development of atherosclerosis is unable to speculate the clinical outcomes in the later stages. More time period should be applied with normal chow to clarify the exact effect of IF on spontaneous development of atherosclerosis.  Hypercholesterolemia is the main risk factor for CVDs. Thus, LDL management is the primary aim in clinical practice to reduce acute CVDs events.",2149457c-dc38-4aea-9b44-22335eb0790c
29,discussion2," Statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, apolipoprotein A-I–based therapies, and other lipid-lowering therapies have been demonstrated to reduce CVDs events (Zhang et al., 2016; Pulipati and Davidson, 2020). In our study, both TC and LDL-C were significantly decreased by IF treatment, indicating amelioration of hypercholesterolemia is one of the main contributors in the reduction of atherosclerosis. Serum cholesterol levels are affected by dietary intake, cholesterol synthesis, transport, and metabolism. We determined that the food intake was reduced by IF, suggesting the cholesterol intake is also reduced. Moreover, we observed that cholesterol levels in the liver were reduced by IF treatment, which should be attributed to reduced cholesterol synthesis. In addition, hepatic TG levels were also reduced by IF treatment.",f10f55a8-be2f-4153-9c86-b15d8d55c83f
30,discussion3," Reduced cholesterol and TG levels in the liver result in the decrease of lipid accumulation in the tissue and contribute to reduced atherosclerosis. However, the main transcriptional factor, SREBP2, which controls the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the liver, was not significantly affected by IF. Lu et al. demonstrated the post-prandial increase in insulin and the glucose concentration stimulates mTORC1 to phosphorylate the deubiquitylase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 20 (USP20) at S132 and S134, which is recruited to the hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) complex and antagonizes its degradation . Further studies should be done to determine if the reduced hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) expression by intermittent fasting is related with the mTORC1/USP20/hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) pathway.  LDL-C lowering treatment is insufficient to reduce CVD events in all patients.",fc939d2f-b98b-487d-8238-abbb0a96fefa
31,discussion4," Indeed, atherosclerosis has also been recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease. Thus, the vascular inflammation, such as NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-IL-1β pathway, can be another target for CVD treatment . For instance, the results of the Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study demonstrate that treatment with monoclonal IL-1β-neutralizing antibody canakinumab reduces the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with prior heart attack . However, in this study, we observed that IF had no effect on serum IL-1β levels, indicating IF-reduced atherosclerosis is unrelated to the regulation of inflammasome activity. IFNγ is another pro-inflammatory cytokine and mainly produced by T lymphocytes. It is involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses , many of which are pro-atherogenic.",af4ce981-3222-4c75-9bbe-c8c4335aff64
32,discussion5," IFNγ administration exacerbated AS via increasing the T-cell number within lesions in atherosclerosis-prone apoE-/- mice . Deletion of IFNγ reduces atherosclerosis in a sex-dependent manner in the rodent model . We found that IF has no effect on IFNγ levels either, which is consistent with unchanged T cell population by IF treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that the IF treatment in our study has weak anti-inflammatory effects.  During atherosclerosis initiation/progression and under the influence of inflammatory stimuli, the splenic monocytes are recruited to the atherogenic vessel wall via the systemic circulation, where they adhere and enter the arterial vessel wall through the activated endothelial cells via binding to the specific adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, P-selectin, and E-selectin .",c714e4c2-8b2a-4a0d-b612-60af3171ddcc
33,discussion6," In spite of the weak anti-inflammatory effect, we still observed that IF treatment clearly reduces monocyte adhesion or the migration of endothelium or the accumulation of macrophage/foam cells in plaques by reducing CCL2, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 levels, and circulating inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocytes. However, the exact mechanism of IF on Ly6Chigh monocyte mobilization, CCL2 production was unclear. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2/4 (PDK2/4) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)) were reported to be involved in glucose metabolism and insulin secretion during fasting . PDK2/4 were also metabolic checkpoints for the polarization of macrophages to the M1 phenotype since PDK2/4 double knockout ameliorated inflammation .",2c6f4da0-7426-4a69-ae52-0da484af9a03
34,discussion7," We determined that the CCL2 (also known as MCP1) was reduced by IF, suggesting that the M1 phenotype polarization was reduced, which may be related with PDK2/4 and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) expression. Moreover, it has been reported that alternate-day fasting protected cardiovascular system by activating autophagy . Autophagy plays an inverse function in cardiovascular disease, which can be triggered by ER stress (Kolattukudy and Niu, 2012). CCL2 was reported to induce plaque destabilization by increasing the activity of the ubiquitin–proteosome system in the inflammatory macrophages, which suggest that CCL2 may link ER stress to inflammation . Considering the reduced CCL2 and necrotic core level by IF, it will be worthy investigating if autophagy involved in IF-reduced atherosclerosis in the future.",b5ebfd70-81b1-44b3-af96-2daa9f8dfd57
35,discussion8,"  Taken together, our study for the first time demonstrates that IF treatment alleviates the development of atherosclerosis and increases plaque stability. Mechanistically, IF inhibits monocyte adhesion and infiltration to endothelium by reducing and circulating CCL2 levels and Ly6Chigh monocytes. It also substantially reduces HFD-induced hypercholesterolemia by reducing the intake of cholesterol and cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Thus, our study also suggests that circulating monocytes and CCL2 levels should be considered as the key primary end points as other commonly determined circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as c-reactive protein, IL-1β, or tumor necrosis factor. In conclusion, our study suggests IF can be an effective non-pharmaceutical therapy for atherosclerosis treatment and have potential clinical applications.",f7f07acc-5ef3-4296-87b3-b1a8d583d50d
