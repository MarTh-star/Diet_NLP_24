0,methods0," Animal husbandry and diet intervention  All experiments adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)), protocol numbers 2016-1778 and 2019-2258. For aged mice, male and female C57BL/6 mice were obtained between 60 and 65 weeks of age (Stock No.: 000664, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and group-housed (3–5 same-sex mice per cage) in the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute Biological Resource Unit on a 14-hr light/10-hr dark cycle, temperature between 20 and 23 °C, 30–70% relative humidity. The mice had ad libitum (AL) access to standard rodent chow (18.6% protein, 44.2% carbohydrate, and 6.2% fat; Teklad Global Rodent Diet #2918, Envigo, Madison, WI).",f30852bb-bf62-4921-9189-eb136743b8c7
1,methods1," At approximately 20 months of age, male and female cages were randomly assigned to either every other day (EOD) fasting regimen (Chow every other day (EOD) group: n = 6 males, n = 7 females to start) or AL access to the standard rodent chow (Chow AL group: n = 7 males; n = 6 females to start). The every other day (EOD) fasting regimen consisted of repeated cycles of 24-hr consecutive removal of food access with water available AL (fast day) followed by 24-hr access to food and water AL (fed day). To circumvent possible disturbances in circadian rhythms and feeding patterns in the Chow every other day (EOD) group [81, 82], the food was provided to or removed from the Chow every other day (EOD) group 2–3 hrs before the dark cycle onset (19:00 hr). The daily food intake was periodically measured via manual weighing on a per cage basis over the 78-day post-dietary intervention (DI) from approximately 80 weeks of age (baseline; day 0) (see Fig. 1a for diet logistics).",0c62a8d8-d11c-44fa-9646-f48bc5626d4e
2,methods2," Similarly, 6-month-old male and female C57BL/6 mice born in the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute Biological Resource Unit were maintained on the standard rodent chow until being randomly divided into Chow AL (n = 3 mice/sex) and Chow every other day (EOD) (n = 3 mice/sex) diet groups for 1 week to monitor weight and body composition changes as the young adult group.  Frailty measures (see Fig. 1b for the list of tools)  Metabolic parameters  Body weight was monitored at baseline, days 7, 14, 21, 31, 45, 57, 66, and 76 post-DI for the aged group, and at baseline, day 3, and day 7 post-DI in the young group via manual weighing on a digital scale. Body composition (% fat mass and % lean mass) was assessed at baseline and at the conclusion of the study (day 78 post-DI for the aged group and day 7 post-DI for the young group) using EchoMRI body composition analysis (EchoMRI, Houston, TX).",2733499f-89fe-4c2f-a251-2b8414d9d9a7
3,methods3," Glucose tolerance test (Glucose tolerance test (GTT)) was performed at 13:00 hr on day 70 after a 4-hr morning fast. The mice were given an intraperitoneal glucose injection (2 g of glucose/kg body weight) followed by blood glucose measurements at time points between 0 and 120 min post-injection with an Accu-Chek glucose meter (Roche Diabetes Care, Inc., Indianapolis, IN). This procedure was repeated on day 71 to account for the differences between the fast and fed days to avoid making a type I error or have a single overnight fast influencing the result. The presented data reflect the average blood glucose levels across the two days. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were tested using an A1CNow blood monitor (PTS Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) after a 4-hr morning fast on day 78 post-DI. Plasma insulin levels were measured via the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) kit (Cat.",523ee5c2-49e2-4cdb-8291-81fad07c1056
4,methods4," # EZRMI-13K, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), and plasma creatinine concentration level was measured via a creatinine colorimetric assay kit (Cat. # MAK080, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) per manufactures’ instructions.  Indirect calorimetry  Circadian metabolic rhythms were measured by the Oxymax-CLAMS indirect calorimetry (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) at baseline and ~day 38 post-DI. In this system, mice were individually housed for 4-consecutive 24-hr periods to measure food intake, ambulatory activity levels, O2 consumption (vO2), CO2 production (vCO2), energy expenditure (heat; 3.815 + 1.232 × respiratory exchange ratio [RER]), and RER (vCO2/vO2), which reflects the type of substrate that is being utilized. Double-plotted actograms were composed using the averaged data for each time point separated by the fed and fast days with a time of the day expressed in Zeitgeber time (ZT).",85532477-ad27-4a56-80ba-52555aee6332
5,methods5," Similar to as when in the standard animal cages and vivarium housing rooms, Chow every other day (EOD) mice were fed or fasted at approximately ZT9 daily. To observe changes in the circadian rhythm, the amplitudes/fluctuations of the rhythm were determined using the area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) method. In addition, to test whether circadian pattern (i.e., timing of a reference point in the cycle) was shifted, the average dark phase area under the curve (AUC) and light phase area under the curve (AUC) were compared.  Behavioral tasks  To reduce the effects of experimenter-induced anxiety and stress on behavior-related assays, mice were handled three consecutive days (2-min per mouse on the 1st day, 1-min each on the 2nd+ days) at least 48 hr before the behavioral assays. All behavioral tasks were carried out during the light cycle at the Rodent Behavior Core testing suite in the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute Biological Resource Unit.",ef729f72-2261-4f62-a85e-503f896cf95b
6,methods6," The battery of behavioral tasks was conducted in the order of Y maze forced alternation task, forelimb grip strength, open field, novel place recognition task, and rotarod, and the order was kept constant for each animal. The mice were habituated in the testing suite at least 30 min before and after each behavioral testing day. They were given at least 48 hr apart in-between each task to minimize any carry-over effects. Males and females were tested separately in a random order for each task. Behavioral apparatuses were wiped with 70% ethanol in-between trials and mice to eliminate olfactory cues. Behavioral sessions were digitally recorded using a CCTV camera mounted to the ceiling positioned directly above behavioral apparatuses. All recorded behavioral sessions were analyzed using the behavior analysis software TopScanLite Version 2.0 (Clever Sys Inc., Reston, VA) or EthoVision XT 13.0 (Noldus, Wageningen, the Netherlands).",c1d1ef3c-fd72-483a-a4d0-798024a76871
7,methods7," Outliers from each task were excluded from further analyses.  Y maze forced alternation task  Short-term memory was tested using the Y maze forced alternation task at baseline and ~day 50 posy-DI. This task requires the functional integrity of the hippocampus [83, 84]. Mice were trained in a Y maze (each arm 12 cm H, 38.5 cm D, 9 cm W) surrounded by intra and extra maze visual cues. During the acquisition trial, mice were released into a distal end of one of two randomly selected starting arms facing away from the center of the Y maze. The mice did not have access to the third arm, also termed the target arm, during training. Mice were allowed to freely investigate the two arms for 15 min. Then they were placed back into their home cages in the behavioral testing suite. After a 2-hr inter-trial interval (inter trial interval (ITI)), a 4-min memory probe test was given.",9db08be2-d29e-4376-8a55-389de2d1ad55
8,methods8," The mice were released into the Y maze in an identical manner as training, but the dividing wall to the target arm was removed. They were allowed to freely investigate the arms. The duration and number of entries to each arm and velocity/speed during the retention trial were recorded for further analyses. Two-hour inter trial interval (ITI) was chosen given that 2 hr after training, young healthy rats enter the target arm and spend more time above chance (33%) during the retention trial [85]; however, aged mice fail to show a preference for the target arm with this inter trial interval (ITI) duration [86–88]. This task was repeated on ~day 50 with different intra and extra maze cues.  Open field  During the habituation phase of the novel place recognition test, the mice were given a 10-min open field trial at baseline and ~day 59 post-DI. An open field (40.5 cm H × 51.0 cm D × 61.0 cm W) was virtually divided into 3 arenas: outer, middle, and center.",b5d55a0e-5907-4582-9e87-a38747141f2a
9,methods9," Behavior was digitally recorded for further analysis. The number of entries, duration, and latency to the center arena (anxiety-like behavior), rearing (exploratory/anxiolytic behavior), and distance traveled/path length and velocity (locomotion) were measured.  Novel place recognition test  Twenty-four hours after the open field test, object location memory was tested using the novel place recognition (novel place recognition (NPR)) test at baseline and ~day 60 post-DI. In this task, two identical objects (random assignment to either glass media bottles filled with corncob bedding or plastic sippy cups filled with water) were placed at fixed and equidistant locations in an open field. Mice were released into the outer edge of the open field facing away from the center of the arena and were allowed to freely investigate the objects and the open field for 5 min.",30ff9a15-c9f0-431a-b26f-e1b7047e71e7
10,methods10," Then they were placed back into their home cage and were remained in the behavioral testing suite for a minimum of 30 min before transported back to the vivarium. After a 24 hr inter trial interval (ITI), a 2-min memory probe test was given. Mice were reintroduced to the identical environment and objects, but one of the objects was moved to a new location, located at an opposite corner relative to the original location. The other object remained at the same location. Mice were allowed to freely investigate in the open field. Object investigation duration and proximity to the objects during the retention trial were recorded for further analyses. A discrimination index was calculated as the duration of object investigation at a new location minus the duration of investigation of an object that has not moved, divided by the total object investigation duration. Thus, a positive score on the discrimination index means the mouse investigated the object at a new location longer.",d2814871-dfed-4512-97e5-f6bdcce83b8c
11,methods11," Due to the innate preference of rodents for novelty, rodents with intact hippocampal function will investigate an object moved to a new location more than an unmoved object [89–93]. Also, proximity to the objects was calculated as the ratio of the distances between the center of the moved object and the tip of the mouse nose divided by the distance between the center of the unmoved object and the tip of the mouse nose. Thus, a greater proximity ratio indicates that the mouse directed its face closer to the unmoved object than to the moved object. Twenty-four-hour inter trial interval (ITI) was chosen given that 24 hr after training, young 2–4-month-old mice show a preference for a moved object; however, 22–24-month-old mice do not [94]. This task was repeated on ~day 60 post-DI with different objects and placements.",a6c9442c-4c8a-40f7-b7b8-a775410def1b
12,methods12,"  Muscular strength and neuromuscular function parameters  Forelimb grip strength was assessed at baseline and ~day 48 using a grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Each mouse was given five trials, and average grip strength (g) and average grip strength adjusted to body weight (grip strength [g]/body weight [g]) were recorded. The fold change in strength was then calculated. Motor coordination was tested using a rotarod (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Briefly, following the acclimation trial (4 rpm for 30 sec), mice were given a total of four trials (max duration: 300 sec, max speed: 50 rpm, acceleration: 1 rpm inclement per 11 sec per trial) with 5-min inter trial interval (ITI). Latency and speed at which the mouse fell from or passively rotated on a revolving rod were recorded in trial 2–4 as a measure of motor coordination.",a1079fea-b173-4c80-98bf-2e2baa60730f
13,methods13,"  Molecular and hormonal parameters  Filter paper-embedded lead acetate endpoint assay  The endogenous H2S production capacities of liver, kidney, muscle (quadriceps), heart, and brain were measured by the lead sulfide method as previously described [95, 96]. Briefly, tissues were immediately harvested from euthanized animals and flash-frozen. Flash-frozen tissues were then homogenized and lysed in freshly prepared 1× passive lysis buffer (Cat. # E1941, Promega, Madison, WI). One hundred micrograms of normalized protein with the 150 μL of reaction mixture containing 10 mM L-cysteine (Cat. #. 168149, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1 mM pyridoxal phosphate (Cat. # 9255, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in phosphate-buffered saline was placed in 96-well plates. A lead acetate-embedded H2S detection filter paper was placed on top of the well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2–24 hr.",1f1deefb-ff69-4b68-bd82-ec071410a1c0
14,methods14," H2S production capacity was quantified by measuring the lead sulfide darkening/density of the paper using the IntDen function in ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2018).  Real-time quantitative PCR analysis  Gene expression of (1) neuroinflammatory cytokine nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and its downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), interleukin 6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), (2) a neuroprotective chaperone protein PARK7/DJ-1, (3) anorexigenic and orexigenic genes proopiomelanocortin (proopiomelanocortin (POMC)), and agouti-related protein (AgRP), and (4) the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) gene in the hypothalamus was quantified using a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method as previously described [97] with slight modifications per manufactures’ instructions.",9bf8a074-11f1-4cc1-b3ec-f9aefdcf482c
15,methods15," Briefly, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Cat. # 15596026, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA), and single-stranded cDNA was synthesized using Verso cDNA kit (Cat. # AB1453A, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). qPCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Cat. # 4385612, Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) with the primer mix containing forward and reverse ReadyMade Primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) of a targeted gene. Plates were run on Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. Targeted gene expression was measured using a relative quantitation (ΔΔCT) method comparing against the reference/housekeeping gene β-actin.

17,methods17," The behavior analysis software TopScanLite Version 2.0 (Clever Sys Inc., Reston, VA) or EthoVision XT 13.0 (Noldus, Wageningen, the Netherlands) was used for the appropriate behavioral tasks. All data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) or GraphPad Prism for Windows, Version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Results were considered statistically significant when p values were less than 0.05.  For food intake analysis, a 2 × 2 × 3 analysis of variance (a 2 × 2 × 3 analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was used to test the effects of sex (male vs. female), DI (Chow AL vs. Chow every other day (EOD)), and day (fast days, fed days, and combined). Post hoc comparisons were performed using Tukey’s HSD or independent samples t tests.",36c5bf3d-4180-4612-8f02-6d59f9075f6c
18,methods18," Due to the sexually dimorphic effect of every other day (EOD) fasting on food intake, for other dependent variables, independent samples t tests were carried out to test the effects of DI, and dependent samples t tests were conducted to test the effects of time (baseline vs. the various post-DI time points and the light vs. the dark cycle) separately for each sex. For the forced alternation task, one-sample t tests were conducted to see whether each of the DI group spent in the target arm below chance (hypothetical value of 80 sec). The Pearson product-moment correlation matrices (one-tailed) were computed to test the a priori-predicted relationships (1) among the frailty measures in both males and females, (2) between renal H2S production and frailty measures in males, and (3) between renal H2S production and hypothalamic gene expression in males.

19,results0," Late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting decreases food consumption and body weight and alters body composition in a sexually dimorphic manner  To test the effects of every other day (EOD) fasting on caloric intake in aged mice, food consumption per BW was measured periodically over the 78 days of DI to determine average food intake during the fast days, the fed days, and combined (Fig. 1c). There were significant main effects of sex (p < 0.0001), DI (p < 0.0001), and food intake day (p < 0.0001) and significant interaction effects of sex × food intake day (p < 0.05), DI × food intake day (p < 0.0001), and sex × DI × food intake day (p < 0.05) on the kcal of food consumed. Specifically, females consumed more food per BW relative to males. As expected, mice that remained on the AL feeding regimen (Chow AL) consumed more food overall than the mice placed on the every other day (EOD) fasting regimen (Chow every other day (EOD)).",32701dad-9e49-4872-b365-b5b975262000
20,results1," Specifically, the male Chow every other day (EOD) group consumed more food during the fed days (M = 0.37 kcal/g BW/day) by 124% relative to the male Chow AL group (M = 0.30 kcal/g BW/day). Therefore, the male Chow every other day (EOD) group consumed less food per BW on average (M = 0.18 kcal/g BW/day), specifically by − 38%, relative to the male Chow AL group (Fig. 1c). Similarly, the female Chow every other day (EOD) group consumed more food per BW during the fed days (M = 0.59 kcal/g BW/day) relative to the female Chow AL group (M = 0.37 kcal/g BW/day), specifically by 162%. As a result, overall food intake was not significantly different between the female Chow AL and the Chow every other day (EOD) groups (M = 0.30 kcal/ g BW/day; − 19% change; Fig. 1c). Thus, while every other day (EOD) fasting was an effective caloric restricting regimen in aged male mice, it failed to decrease overall food intake in aged female mice.",e0c57e05-be11-4e03-9048-060ed874b0cc
21,results2," Given that the DI-induced food/caloric intake differed across the male and female aged mice, subsequent behavioral and physiological measures were analyzed separately for each sex.  Body weight and body composition in the form of fat and lean masses were recorded periodically from baseline to day 76 post-DI for aged mice (Fig. 1d–g) and from baseline to day 7 post-DI for the young adult mice cohort (Supplemental Figure 1A–D). every other day (EOD) fasting in males reduced their BW continuously during the entire span of DI, as their BW was decreased relative to baseline on each BW recording day (Fig. 1d and Supplemental Figure 1A). Body composition analysis by EchoMRI [98, 99] revealed the decrease in BW was mainly due to a decrease in % fat mass relative to baseline (Fig. 1e and Supplemental Figure 1B). The aged male Chow AL group maintained their BW during the entire span of the experiment, except for trend (p = 0.",d0f28bc8-82be-47f2-9f15-43ae5f096d82
22,results3,"089) in decreased mass in their final BW on day 76 relative to baseline (Fig. 1d). This subtle decrease was most likely due to a decrease in their % lean mass, with their % fat mass unaffected (Fig. 1e). every other day (EOD) fasting in females decreased their BW soon after the initiation of the DI (Fig. 1f and Supplemental Figure 1C). However, in contrast to males, BW-reducing effects of every other day (EOD) fasting diminished before the end of the experiment. Specifically, BWs of the female Chow every other day (EOD) group were continuously decreased relative to the female Chow AL group until day 47, but not beyond this time point (Fig. 1f). Similarly, in the young adult female group, weight loss was more dramatic at 3 days rather than 7 days post-DI (Supplemental Figure 1C). Body composition analysis revealed % fat mass and % lean masses were not affected by DI or by time in aged females (Fig. 1g).",22e9982e-afd1-4a7e-8214-6b5a91643e3c
23,results4," Likewise, young females had a less dramatic change in body mass composition compared to young males under every other day (EOD) fasting (Supplemental Figure 1D). Thus, every other day (EOD) fasting decreased BW primarily by decreasing fat mass in aged males, but not in aged females, with analogous results observed in young adult mice.  Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting attenuates metabolic inflexibility  As metabolic flexibility declines with age [100, 101], we next tested resting whole body metabolic activity using indirect calorimetry in a 12-chamber open-circuit Oxymax Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Individual food intake patterns for both males and females as determined by manual weighing daily (Fig. 2a, b) were similar to the entire experimental span of experimenter manually determined food intake (Fig.",b3c88840-8aec-4e70-8256-f4cca4b22b05
24,results5," 1c), and the time when the mice initiated major feeding was similar between Chow AL and Chow every other day (EOD) groups (Supplemental Figure 2A, B). Specifically, in males, there was a non-significant decreasing trend (p = 0.13) in overall kcal consumption of food in the Chow every other day (EOD) group relative to the Chow AL group (Fig. 2a). However, in females, overall kcal consumption was not affected by the every other day (EOD) fasting due to an increase in food consumption during the fed days relative to the female Chow AL group (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2 Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting affects body weight-adjusted resting metabolism. a, b Average food intake (kcal/g of body weight) per mouse over the 4-day period in the metabolic chamber was determined by manual weighing daily in the male (a) and female (b) Chow AL and Chow every other day (EOD) groups (n = 3–6 mice per sex per group).",71693e3e-480b-442b-9a7d-be034a50dcb7

26,results7," The significant circadian rhythms were observed on metabolic processes in all of the groups, as vO2, vCO2, and heat during the dark phases were elevated relative to the light phases (all p < 0.05, except for vCO2 in the male Chow AL group p = 0.054; Table 1). In comparison with the male Chow AL group, every other day (EOD) fasting in males did not affect overall vO2, as well as segmented vO2, which were separated by the light and dark phases and by fast and fed days (Fig. 2c). However, in females, every other day (EOD) fasting increased the amplitudes of vO2 during the dark and light phases of the fed days relative to the Chow AL group, which became apparent at the onset of feeding (≈ ZT9, indicated by the arrow) while the food was present (Fig. 2d). Overall vCO2 was slightly, but non-significantly, decreased (p = 0.",a6236ab4-72f7-4ee0-9aa4-53b0dfd2fe9c
27,results8,"053) in the male Chow every other day (EOD) group relative to the Chow AL group, which was driven by the decrease in vCO2 during the dark and light phases of the fast days (Fig. 2e). In contrast, every other day (EOD) fasting in females increased the amplitude of vCO2 during the dark and light phases of the fed days relative to the female Chow AL group, which contributed to an increased overall vCO2 (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, every other day (EOD) fasting in males did not affect heat/energy expenditure (Fig. 2g). However, every other day (EOD) fasting in females tended to increase overall heat production (p = 0.056), which was due to an increase in the amplitude of heat during the dark and light phases of the fed days (Fig. 2h).",4143f71c-97dc-48f7-8b52-4f7b3249f97a
28,results9," Importantly, circadian rhythms in regard to feeding timing and movement activity patterns were minimally affected by the every other day (EOD) fasting, most likely due to strict adherence to re-feeding at the same time the Chow AL group mice naturally consume their food, i.e., around the start of the dark phase (Table 1, Supplemental Figure 2A–F). Taken together, these findings indicate every other day (EOD) fasting enhanced whole body-generated metabolic flexibilities and capabilities in a sex-dependent manner.Table 1 Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting selectively attenuates aging-related circadian pattern disruptions.

30,results15,"0001  Remarkably, the effects of every other day (EOD) fasting became prominent on the RER calculated by dividing the vCO2 by the vO2 (Fig. 3g, h). Specifically, every other day (EOD) fasting produced a dynamic circadian rhythm of RER by extending the period (i.e., the time interval between peaks [106]) in males (Fig. 3g) and females (Fig. 3h). In particular, this effect was more pronounced in females, given that every other day (EOD) fasting increased the amplitudes of RER during the dark and light phases of the fed days in females relative to the Chow AL group, but not in males. These findings reflect that every other day (EOD) fasting resulted in a larger shift from fatty acid to carbohydrate oxidation depending on food availability, which was greater in females than males.",76e99b73-04c7-44a5-bcba-6aaef4795000
31,results16," In sum, these findings indicate that every other day (EOD) fasting initiated late in life is effective at inducing differential macronutrient oxidation, with the extent of net RER amplitude changes being sexually dimorphic.  Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting improves glucose handling and clearance capacity  Given that every other day (EOD) fasting enhanced RER amplitudes indicative of differential energy source utilization, we next tested glucose handling and clearance capacity using the glucose tolerance test (Glucose tolerance test (GTT)).

However, both male and female Chow every other day (EOD) groups showed lower blood glucose levels, enhanced glucose tolerance, and handling capacity compared to the AL control groups post glucose administration (Fig. 4b). Specifically, there were − 33% and − 20% changes in the area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)) for the male and female Chow every other day (EOD) groups relative to controls, respectively (Fig. 4b). Additionally, improved glucose handling in both male and female every other day (EOD) groups was most prominent at the 20–30-min post glucose injection (Fig. 4b). However, only male Chow every other day (EOD) mice, but not female Chow every other day (EOD) mice, maintained lower blood glucose levels at later 90–120-min time points compared to Chow AL mice.",896ff735-806d-4dc7-95ad-37aebbedf6b7
33,results18," This can be attributed to female Chow AL mice obtaining lower blood glucose levels similar to their every other day (EOD) counterparts at these later time points in the Glucose tolerance test (GTT) (Fig. 4b), suggesting female mice may inherently have better glucose tolerance than males at advanced ages. Likewise, Hemoglobin A1C, a glycated form of hemoglobin and a stable clinical blood marker of diabetes [107, 108], was decreased in the male Chow every other day (EOD) group compared to the Chow AL group (Fig. 4c), but was not detectable in female mice (Fig. 4c).

Forelimb muscle strength was measured using a grip strength meter at baseline and post-DI, and the aging- and diet-induced change in forelimb muscle strength calculated (Fig. 5a).

However, these effects were not observed in the female Chow every other day (EOD) group (Fig. 5b, c). Taken together, these findings suggest that every other day (EOD) fasting functionally improves motor coordination and balance in males, but not in females, possibly by promoting centrally regulated motor learning during aging.  Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting enhances hippocampal-dependent short-term memory  Spatial and episodic learning and memory decline with age [112], primarily due to the disruption of normal hippocampal activity [117]. Thus, we ran a battery of tests to determine if late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting preserves and/or improves hippocampal function. First, male and female mice were tested in the Y maze forced alternation task at baseline and post-DI.",f3c579bc-79d8-4c43-9eab-1171f228decd

Young adult rodents have an innate curiosity toward novelty, thus in this task, they show an increased preference for the novel/target arm [85, 118]. However, as animals age, it is not well understood how this preference changes as a function of age and diet. At baseline prior to DI, there was no significant difference between the male Chow AL and the Chow every other day (EOD) groups on the number of entries to the target arm (Fig. 6b). In contrast, every other day (EOD) fasting in males increased the number of target arm entries compared with the male Chow AL group post-DI (Fig. 6b).

Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting enhances long-term object location memory  To test whether the memory-enhancing effects of late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting on spatial memory are reproducible in another hippocampal-dependent memory task, we conducted the novel place recognition (NPR) test at baseline and post-DI in male and female mice. They were given a 5-min training trial on day 1 and a 2-min retention trial 24 hr later, with representative data output shown in Fig. 8a. Most mice, at least when young adults, prefer to investigate a novel location object [121]. In the baseline retention trial, we detected no significant difference between groups within sex (Fig. 8b).",a9c58a71-08f8-4b61-a282-d505b0eabfd7

When compared with their baseline discrimination index, the post-DI discrimination index of the male every other day (EOD) fasting group was increased, specifically above 0.5, indicating that their hippocampal-dependent memory was enhanced following the DI (Fig. 8b). The every other day (EOD) fasting-induced enhancement was similarly observed in the proximity to objects measure, which is a ratio of the average distance from the nose of the mouse to the moved and unmoved objects (Fig. 8c). Specifically, the male every other day (EOD) group directed their face closer (i.e., investigation) to the novel location object more than the Chow AL group post-DI.",44f9ba17-e1fc-4c54-95f7-543929592552
49,results34," Furthermore, although it was non-significant, a decreasing trend (p = 0.065) in the proximity to objects measure was observed compared to itself baseline/pre-DI (Fig. 8c).

(2017) [16] determined frailty by counting the number of deficits accumulated in aged, and with that, they found highly frail individuals or mice would have a decrease in multiple health and physiological conditions. Thus, we tested the a priori-predicted relationships between each frailty measure with the other frailty measures utilized in our current study on a per animal basis.",3e066e42-cba3-4b83-85f0-fdd870d1e8ed
52,results37," Pearson’s correlation coefficients were computed among the selected metabolic, musculoskeletal, neurobehavioral, and cognitive measures collected from all of the mice (males and females combined) to produce a correlation matrix (Fig. 8d). In general, individual frailty variables co-present with other individual frailty variables, which is in line with previous studies using the frailty indices for mice [18]. Thus, our findings suggest that the aged mice who exhibit a deficit in one of the frailty variables are likely to perform poorly in other frailty measures, and every other day (EOD) fasting thus dampens the onset and/or severity of multiple frailty endpoints.  Renal H2S production capacity is enhanced by late-life every other day (EOD) fasting and correlates with improved frailty measures  Endogenous H2S production and its downstream signaling have gained ground as a biomarker [78, 80] and possible causal factor for increased healthspan and lifespan [96, 122–124].",b7c5bd45-5ba3-4eb1-bdfa-f5e40af9919b
53,results38," Meanwhile, aging decreases H2S production in the liver and kidney [79, 125]. However, it is not clear whether late-life every other day (EOD) fasting maintains and/or augments H2S production in a tissue-specific manner and whether the beneficial effects of late-life every other day (EOD) fasting are associated with changes in H2S production capacity. Thus, we next tested the possible association of endogenous H2S production capacity on the beneficial anti-frailty effects of late-life every other day (EOD) fasting that were demonstrated in the male mice. We first measured H2S production capacity in liver, kidney, heart, muscle (quadriceps), and brain from the male and female Chow AL and Chow every other day (EOD) groups. Similar to previous findings in our laboratory [126, 127], we detected the highest endogenous H2S production capacity in the liver and kidney (Fig. 9a, Supplemental Figure 9A), while less H2S production was observed in the brain, heart, and muscle (Fig. 9b).",8d57bd6c-abd3-4e7d-a6ef-6c93a1f0072f
54,results39," every other day (EOD) fasting in males increased H2S production capacity in the kidney (Fig. 9a); however, every other day (EOD) fasting had no impact on the H2S production in the liver, brain, heart, and muscle (Fig. 9a, b). In females, there were no significant diet-induced changes in H2S production for any of the organs assayed (Supplemental Figure 9B, C). To rule out the possibility that the renal H2S production capacity was enhanced in the male Chow every other day (EOD) group by reversing aging-related renal injury, rather than by an augmentation of renal H2S production capacity per se, we measured plasma creatinine levels in male mice. every other day (EOD) fasting had no impact on circulating creatinine, as the plasma creatinine levels were equivalent between the Chow AL and the Chow every other day (EOD) groups (Supplemental Figure 9D).",6d827047-a92d-49d8-80c2-d99456cc0275

Thus, as a first step, we computed a correlation matrix for renal H2S production capacity and the various frailty measures obtained from male mice only to discover whether significant relationships (Fig. 9c). There were significant correlations between renal H2S production capacity and improvements in metabolic and cognitive endpoints, but not with muscular function.",28bab628-5df9-4b68-a58e-2bc794314b74
57,results42," However, the causal role of enhanced renal H2S production capacity in many of the anti-frailty benefits derived from the every other day (EOD) fasting intervention is yet to be determined. Taken together, our finding shows that renal H2S may modulate the positive effects of every other day (EOD) fasting on frailty, at least it correlates with the frailty improvements in males.  Late-life every other day (EOD) fasting affects neuroinflammatory cytokines and a neuronal antioxidant defense gene, but not the anorexigenic, orexigenic, and synaptic plasticity-related genes in the hypothalamus  The brain is a master regulator of energy intake and expenditure, muscular function, and cognition. Especially, the hypothalamus is a critical brain area for energy regulation and metabolism [128–130], and inflammatory responses in the hypothalamus contribute to obesity, glucose homeostasis dysregulation, and overall health maintenance [131].",3c66c85e-83c3-42df-8c8f-b85cbd5c6fdc

However, downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF-α were unaffected by the every other day (EOD) fasting. Interestingly, every other day (EOD) fasting downregulated another downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β by 0.49-fold, indicating that the every other day (EOD) fasting selectively affects NF-κB-associated downstream activity (Fig. 10a).

We found that renal H2S production was not associated with the hypothalamic NF-κB gene expression; however, the renal H2S production capacity was associated with a reduction in the IL1β gene expression and with increased expression of the DJ-1 gene (Fig. 10b).",6fca0579-94f8-4a6c-bc2a-34cbd0563167
61,results46," In sum, every other day (EOD) fasting reduces hypothalamic inflammatory cytokine and increases neuroprotective gene expression, which are associated with renal H2S production capacity. Therefore, it raises the possibility that late-life every other day (EOD) fasting slows neuroinflammation via boosting renal H2S production capacity. ",5b03978e-4f33-4080-9e8f-aeeef7b05c10
62,discussion0," The present study is the first to show that late-life initiated every other day (EOD) intermittent fasting decreases aging-related frailty in a sexually dimorphic manner, and the improvements in frailty correlate with renal H2S production. Specifically, the present study showed that late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting in 20-month-old mice decreased overall energy intake in males, but not in females. Also, every other day (EOD) fasting reduced body weight and fat mass and enhanced metabolic fitness, muscular functions, and hippocampal-dependent memory in males, but few positive effects of every other day (EOD) fasting on these measures were observed in females. Furthermore, we demonstrated that every other day (EOD) fasting affected hypothalamic inflammatory responses and increased renal H2S production in males. Interestingly, the renal H2S production capacity was positively correlated with improvements in aging-related frailty.",8a935ab9-6970-4365-9651-395efaedf93e
63,discussion1," Collectively, these results suggest that late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting attenuates multiple components of aging-related frailty in a sex-dependent manner and that these frailty improvements may be due to increased production of renal H2S production, as summarized in Fig. 10c.  Several lines of evidence suggest that the present finding of the sexually dimorphic effects of every other day (EOD) fasting may be due to the difference in the overall caloric intake between males and females. Specifically, we showed that late-life every other day (EOD) fasting increased caloric intake during the fed days in both male and female mice. However, female mice consumed almost twice as much food during the fed periods compared to the controls, resulting in comparable food intake overall to that of the control/AL group.",c5ebeea2-3391-451f-af4d-273af0387efa
64,discussion2," In contrast, there was an overall reduction of caloric intake, specifically by 30–40%, in the male every other day (EOD) fasting group compared to the controls, which may have been a driving force for the beneficial outcomes, as CR of this amount has previously shown to improve multiple aging-related outcomes. For example, 10–40% CR lowered circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines [134] and enhanced glucose homeostasis in the same strain of mice as the present study [134, 135]. Conversely, it is also possible that the outcomes of every other day (EOD) fasting in females, which was equivalent to the time-restricted feeding without decreasing overall kcal intake, produced a somewhat lesser degree of improvement. In support of this prediction, a similar effect was observed in the study by Anson et al. [75].",5bb0ec76-b968-4221-8853-125082497d0d
65,discussion3," Specifically, the every other day (EOD) fasting regimen in the same strain of male mice did not affect the overall food intake due to consuming twice as much of food as the controls following the 24-hr fasting period. As a result, they also showed that the effect of every other day (EOD) fasting was somewhat dampened compared with the continuous CR group. Both the every other day (EOD) fasting and the continuous CR enhanced glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity; however, the levels of circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were oppositely affected by these dietary regimens [75]. Similarly, the same research group showed that the effects of every other day (EOD) fasting on behavior and its associated molecular change were slightly attenuated when compared with the continuous CR group. Specifically, both the every other day (EOD) fasting and the CR decreased aging-related neurobehavioral deficits (i.e.",fa905397-d45b-46fa-b9cd-53825453c336
66,discussion4,", decreased locomotion and memory impairments); however, every other day (EOD) fasting did not decrease hippocampal amyloid β-peptide, while CR did [76]. Therefore, the relatively isocaloric every other day (EOD) fasting compared with the AL feeding observed in the female mice in our current study may have lessened the beneficial effects of every other day (EOD) fasting. This prediction is likely given that the comparative mice study by Mitchell et al (2019) [64] showed that the 30 % CR group experienced the most prominent anti-aging effect on metabolic flexibility, insulin sensitivity, lifespan, and pathological changes compared with the time-restricted feeding group, which was isocalorically fed to that of the control/AL feeding group (similar to our every other day (EOD) fasting in females). On the other hand, the time-restricted feeding group gained some benefits similar to that of the 30% CR group, but to a lesser degree [64].",02f5611d-44a1-4592-b78e-bf1cc31fe1c5
67,discussion5,"  It is also possible that the sexually dimorphic effect of every other day (EOD) fasting was due to the sex-dependent frailty responses to aging. In general, there is a higher prevalence of aging-related frailty in female humans [136–140] and other mammals ([18]; e.g., mice [10, 14, 141, 142] and dogs [143]). The present finding did not make a direct comparison between male and female mice on the frailty levels due to the different food intake patterns during the DI period. However, it is possible that the beneficial effects of every other day (EOD) fasting were not observed in females because the “dose” of the treatment (i.e., the stringency and/or duration of the caloric intake in every other day (EOD) fasting) was not as effective in females as it was in males to reverse or rejuvenate aging-related frailty. Similar sex- and CR dose-dependent phenomena have been reported previously in mice undergoing CR and other dietary restrictions, such as protein restriction [144, 145].",1cb821de-8eb6-4275-aa0d-3a27bd3d5243
68,discussion6," For instance, Mitchell et al. (2016) [144] showed that 20–40% CR affected lifespan, glucose homeostasis, lifespan, body core temperature, aging-related pathological changes, hepatic gene expression, and hepatic H2S production capacity to a different degree for each sex [144]. Specifically, 20–40% CR produced overall improvements in both male and female mice; however, for example, 40% CR induced greater hepatic H2S production than the 20% CR in females, but 20 and 40% CR produced comparable hepatic H2S in males [144]. Similarly, in another study [146], female mice responded to both high and low doses of rapamycin, a longevity-associated drug/pharmacological diet restriction mimetic, while male mice did not positively respond to the low dose in regard to survival.",c56e75c4-8e50-4545-a320-376aa498b974
69,discussion7," Furthermore, acarbose, 17-α-estradiol, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and methylene blue, all of which are implicated as anti-aging agents, produced sex-dependent responses in survivorship, glucose metabolism, and activity levels [147]. Alternatively, our sex-dependent every other day (EOD) fasting outcomes could be attributed to differential maintenance of reproductive versus survival programs in males and females while under dietary stress [145].  In a more simplistic explanation for the differences in male and female responses to every other day (EOD) fasting, it may be possible females at 20 months of this age in our study are not yet having severe aging phenotypes like males, and that could explain why differences in AL vs. every other day (EOD) is smaller in females compared to those males at this age. Perhaps a longer duration of every other day (EOD) fasting may lead to a greater differential in the parameters measured.",c089de37-210e-4f21-82f6-6a18a02313ae
70,discussion8," However, the caveat of waiting too long is the potential for survival bias at very old ages in mice beyond 3 years, in the sense that mice will either be very sick or selected for resiliency. This is one main reason for the choice of aging time point we utilized to perform the dietary intervention and frailty tests (20 months of age), as it is relatively safe and prevents survival bias. So while it is not apparent the mice were showing hallmarks of aging at the start of the study, at the very least the AL fed male mice showed the signs of aging during the study that were somewhat dampened in females.  Previously established and validated frailty indices for rodents (i.e., deficit accumulation model [148]) estimate frailty using various behavioral and physiological assessment tools [11–15]. However, others [18] emphasize that one of the limitations of these studies is the lack of cognitive tasks.",6e8b95ee-1df8-4d78-98c8-0010eb9e3f1a
71,discussion9," To circumvent this disadvantage, and given that the prevalence of memory deficits and associated Alzheimer’s disease remain high in older adults (70+ years; [149]), we assessed the impact of aging and every other day (EOD) fasting on hippocampal-dependent spatial memory, using the Y maze forced alternation task and the novel place recognition (NPR) task. Specifically, we found that in the forced alternation task, there was a significant, but minimal, spatial memory improvement in males induced by every other day (EOD) fasting, but not in females (Fig. 9). Furthermore, we also found that every other day (EOD) fasting enhanced object location memory in males, but only the tendency was observed in females (Fig. 8).",44cac582-b92b-48bb-9f0d-3da851ff87e4
72,discussion10," These memory improvements were in line with previous DR studies in which DR (1) improves memory in adults [150] and older adults [45], (2) protects against hippocampal-dependent memory deficits and accumulations of hippocampal amyloid β-peptide plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease model of mice [76], and (3) rejuvenates hippocampal transcriptome profiles in middle-aged mice [151]. Additionally, similar to our present findings, Li et al. (2013) [73] showed that 11-month long every other day (EOD) fasting in CD-1 wild-type male mice produced time-dependent memory enhancements. Specifically, every other day (EOD) fasting enhanced memory that was tested 1 week after the last training trial (1-week inter-trial interval [inter trial interval (ITI)]) but did not enhance memory when tested 24 hr after the last training trial (24 hr inter trial interval (ITI)).",b04dbb4c-ec66-479d-b3e5-03c755dbf566
73,discussion11," In other words, the retention trial occurred 24 hr after was not long enough to detect the memory retrieval deficits in their study [73]. In our study, a probe trial for the Y maze forced alternation task was given 2 hr after the acquisition trial, and the retention trial for the novel place recognition (NPR) task occurred 24 hr later. Therefore, it is possible that similar to the findings by Li et al. (2013) [73], the beneficial effects of every other day (EOD) fasting on spatial memory improvement may have become more apparent if we utilized a longer retention inter trial interval (ITI), especially for females.  We hypothesize that the beneficial effects of late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting depend on the ability of the kidney to produce H2S. The kidney is one of the organs that produces high levels of H2S [127, 152, 153], which is extremely susceptible to the effects of aging.",b282e009-5e1a-4065-ac29-56b6607ed232
74,discussion12," Specifically, aging decreases expression and/or activity of cystathionine γ-lyase (cystathionine γ lyase (CGL)) and cystathionine β-synthase (cystathionine β synthase (CBS)), the H2S-generating enzymes [125, 154], which are rescuable by the exogenous H2S treatment [125, 154] or long-term CR [79]. A rat model of chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease (CKD)) downregulates cystathionine γ lyase (CGL), cystathionine β synthase (CBS), and the subsequent H2S production in liver and kidney [155]. One of the associated symptoms observed in the older patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is memory deficits [156, 157], along with structural changes in brain morphology, such as the decreased size of the hippocampus [157]. Interestingly, in a rat model of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) treatment decreased chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated memory deficits [158]. These findings suggest that there is a kidney-brain (i.e.",c28965f3-ebaf-48e4-9ab3-a1c73fb0cdc0
75,discussion13,", cognition) connection via H2S signaling. Furthermore, DR in young mice and aged rats [96, 159] increase H2S production in major metabolic organs, including the kidney. In the present study, we showed that every other day (EOD) fasting in males improved frailty, which correlated positively with H2S production capacity in the kidney. The present findings did not reveal causation; however, it certainly showed the relationship between these two factors. Interestingly, we also observed that there was no enhanced renal H2S production capacity in females (Supplemental Figure 9B). This suggests that limited beneficial effects of every other day (EOD) fasting in females may be due to the lack of every other day (EOD) fasting-induced renal H2S production.",15fccdb1-b67d-4ba2-b714-fc442a5c3999
76,discussion14," Future molecular and genetic studies related to every other day (EOD) fasting-induced alterations in tissue-specific protein sulfhydromes and the dependence of H2S generating enzymes for the late-life benefits of dietary interventions are still needed to test these theories.  In summary, our studies demonstrate for the first time that late-life initiated every other day (EOD) fasting reduces frailty in aged mice, an effect that was somewhat dampened in the female mice. Importantly, our findings show that late-life every other day (EOD) fasting attenuates aging-related cognitive decline, which is not typically included in the frailty assessment for rodents. The finding that frailty measures that were utilized in the present study were inter-correlated suggests the validity of these tools as aging-related frailty measures in mice.",128f4aa8-840b-4cc2-b12e-4cf921d23aaa
77,discussion15," We also made the novel discovery that late-life every other day (EOD) fasting of short duration near the end of a mouse’s life is sufficient to increase longevity-associate gasotransmitter H2S production in the kidney. Importantly, this increased renal H2S production was positively correlated with multiple improvements in frailty, as well as a reduction in the inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. Our current work, combined with a growing field of study for mid-life to late-life dietary interventions such as IF and time-restricted feeding [59, 160], offer potential therapeutic avenues and approaches to improve healthspan and prevent cognitive impairment. This emphasizes that it may never be too late to slow or reverse the ravages of aging with lifestyle interventions.",3316dd0f-5585-4c6a-acad-3e0b9712025e
78,discussion16," Given the relative feasibility of integrating an every other day (EOD) fasting regimen into the human lifestyle, particularly in older adults, and the beneficial effects of H2S at the appropriate concentration as an anti-aging agent, our findings suggest that this dietary regimen may be particularly useful for the older adult population to promote a healthy lifespan.
