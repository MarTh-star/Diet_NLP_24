0,methods0," 2.1. Animal and Diets  All animal experiments in our study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tsinghua University (identification number: F16-00228; A5061-01). Three- to four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Research Center of Tsinghua University and bred in the specific pathogen-free experimental animal environment at the Laboratory Animal Research Center of Tsinghua University, with five mice per cage and a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle in a temperature-controlled environment.  After 1 week of acclimation, the mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: normal diet (ND, n = 15) and high fat diet (HFD) (n = 30). ND has 20% kcal from protein, 70% kcal from carbohydrates, and 10% kcal from fat, and high fat diet (HFD) has 20% kcal from protein, 20% kcal from carbohydrates, and 60% kcal from fat (Beijing Keao Xieli Feed Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).",084b5cac-3dd1-4cfb-8fd2-e4ba56baacf0
1,methods1," After 13 weeks of being fed high fat diet (HFD), each of the 30 mice gained 20% more body weight than at week 0. Therefore, it can be considered that the obesity model was established. The mice fed high fat diet (HFD) were further divided into 2 groups to continue having ad libitum access to high fat diet (HFD) or to have IF access to food (high fat diet (HFD)-IF, n = 15) for 8 weeks. Mice in the high fat diet (HFD)-IF group were allowed free access to regular chow every other day and no food on the alternate day [23]. No mice were excluded during the 21-week experiment. The experimental design is shown in Figure 1. The body weight and food consumption were recorded weekly. At the end of the experiment, the eyeball blood of mice was taken after fasting for 12 h. The myocardial tissues were rapidly removed, washed with cold normal saline, dried by blotting on filter paper, weighed, and stored at −80 °C for later use.  2.2.",18bc25e0-2e47-455c-bb80-d7955e80726a
2,methods2," Echocardiography  The cardiac physiological functions were assessed in anesthetized (isoflurane) mice using a two-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography (VINNO 6 VET, VINNO, Suzhou, China) [24]. The left ventricle internal dimension diastole (LVIDd), left ventricle internal dimension systole (LVIDs), and ejection fraction (EF) were evaluated by M-mode echocardiography. Fractional shortening (FS) was calculated with the following formula: FS = (LVIDd − LVIDs)/LVIDd × 100%.  2.3. Biochemical Parameters  Serum levels of glucose (glucose (GLU)), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)), and low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) were measured with a biochemical analyzer (KHB-ZY 1280, Shanghai Kehua Bio-engineering Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Free fatty acid (Free fatty acid (FFA)) contents in serum were determined by an ELISA kit (ab65341, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.",b6419c37-77d6-431c-a3ee-cd8def1967ed
3,methods3," Levels of TG in myocardial tissue were measured using a commercially available kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).  2.4. m6A RNA Methylation Quantification  An EpiQuik m6A RNA methylation quantification kit (EpiGentek, Wuhan, China) was used to quantify the global RNA m6A content in cardiac tissue samples. In brief, add 200 ng of total RNA to the well, incubate with the capture antibody for 1 h, then incubate with the detection antibody for 30 min, and then incubate with the enhancer solution for 30 min at −37 °C. Quantification was measured by reading the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer. The m6A levels in the total RNA was calculated by OD intensity.  2.5. Histology and Oil Red O Staining  The myocardial tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. For the detection of morphological changes, 5-μm-thick dewaxed sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).",0ebf741d-9193-4f47-98e2-15a2ddbb848a
4,methods4," The heart sections were stained with standard Masson trichrome staining to estimate interstitial fibrosis. To evaluate cardiac lipid accumulation, the frozen myocardial tissue was cut in Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura-Finetek, Tokyo, Japan), and then the heart sections (10 μm) were stained with Oil Red O (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Histopathology images were observed and acquired with an Olympus optical microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).  2.6. Transmission Electron Microscopy (Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM))  The mice left ventricle was cut into 1 mm3 piece and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) for 24 h at 4 °C. The heart tissue samples were embedded, cut, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Lipid droplets (LDs) were observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (H-7650B, Ibaraki, Hitachi, Japan).  2.7.",2322f838-0ae5-46d7-9955-8cf13e596b4d
5,methods5," transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) Staining  Apoptosis was examined via using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)) staining according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Beyotime, Nanjing, China). 5μm heart sections were incubated with a transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) reagent mixture and incubated in dark at 37 °C for 1 hand then rinsed three times for 5 min each with PBS. The green positive particles were visualized under a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).  2.8. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR)  Total RNA of mouse cardiac was extracted using Trizol reagent. Reverse transcription was performed with the PrimeScript TM RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan). RT-PCR was detectedusing Quantitative PCR with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Beyotime, Nanjing, China) and CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).",6458209d-dd5b-45b9-a3a7-cd215a23ce4f
6,methods6," The quantitative data were obtained with the 2−ΔΔCt method and normalized to GAPDH. RT-PCR analysis was performed for fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1), fatty acid transporter 1 (FATP1), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid synthase (fatty acid synthase (FAS)), acetyl- CoA carboxylase α (ACCα), adipose triglyceride lipase (adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)), lysosomal acid lipase (lysosomal acid lipase (LAL)), hormone-sensitive lipase (hormone sensitive lipase (HSL)), lipoprotein lipase (lipoprotein lipase (LPL)), METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO), ALKBH5, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, YTHDC1, YTHDC2, and GAPDH.

Western Blot  Total protein was isolated from heart tissue with a RIPA buffer, and the protein concentration was measured with a BCA assay kit.",2381d4ae-29df-43b6-a72a-2f03234ff62a
7,methods7," The protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels with suitable concentration and then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bull serum albumin and then developed with diluted antibodies for Bax (14796, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), Bcl-2 (BS1511, 1:1000, Bioworld, Bloomington, USA), Cleaved Caspase-3 (9661, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), METTL3 (ab240595, 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) (27226-1-AP, 1:1000, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), YTHDF1 (17479–1-AP, 1:1000, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), and GAPDH (10494-1-AP, 1:5000, Proteintech, Wuhan, China) overnight at 4 °C.

The membranes were observed on Image Systems (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).",069acd49-9a75-4f2d-a679-19def755a345
8,methods8," Image Lab software was used for semiquantitative calculation.  2.10. Statistical Analysis  Results were shown as the mean ± standard error of the mean (standard error of the mean (SEM)) from at least three independent experiments. Statistical differences between the groups were analyzed using One-way analysis of variance (analyzed using One way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and post hoc least significant difference (least significant difference (LSD)) multiple-comparison test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 are indicated in figures).  3. Results  3.1. IF Improves high fat diet (HFD)-Induced Mice Obesity Cardiomyopathy  Echocardiography was performed in high fat diet (HFD) mice to determine whether IF had an improvement effect on cardiac function. Compared with mice fed with ND, 21-week high fat diet (HFD) significantly decreased FS% and EF% and increased LVIDs and LVIDd.",216a8c51-5aa6-43ed-841b-c8b38cf39117
9,methods9," These changes caused by high fat diet (HFD) were markedly restored in the hearts treated with IF (Figure 2A–E). high fat diet (HFD) and high fat diet (HFD)-IF did not significantly affect heart rate (Figure 2F). Furthermore, high fat diet (HFD) feeding significantly caused a higher body weight, LV mass, and heart-to-body weight ratio, which were significantly decreased by IF intervention (Figure 2G–I). H&E and Masson staining indicated that morphological abnormalities and interstitial fibrosis were observed in the myocardial tissues of obese mice; however, the above damage was remarkably reversed in high fat diet (HFD)-IF groups (Figure 2J–L). Together, these results demonstrated that IF showed a promising approach in improved obesity cardiomyopathy induced by high fat diet (HFD), suggesting the protective effects on cardiomyocyte injury and dysfunction in obese mice.  3.2.",fd7446d1-2891-4397-b254-8577e80d81fc
10,methods10," IF Ameliorates high fat diet (HFD)-Induced Serum Lipid Metabolic Disorder  In comparison to the NC group, high fat diet (HFD) significantly increased in serum fasting blood glucose, TC, TG, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and Free fatty acid (FFA); however, these effects were remarkably mitigated in the high fat diet (HFD)-IF groups (Figure 3A–F). It was indicated that IF could attenuate serum lipid metabolic disorder induced by high fat diet (HFD).  3.3. IF Alleviates high fat diet (HFD)-Induced Cardiac Lipid Deposition  Metabolic perturbations stemming from obesity could lead to lipid deposition in myocardium [25]. Oil Red O staining and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) suggested that high fat diet (HFD) significantly increased lipid deposition and LDs accumulation in hearts; these abnormalities were restored in the high fat diet (HFD)-IF groups (Figure 4A–D).",873cb87e-71f1-4742-a455-019d109978c8
11,methods11," Additionally, high fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid deposition increases the levels of TG in cardiac were down-regulated by IF intervention (Figure 4E). What’s more, long-term high fat diet (HFD) significantly increased the mRNA expression of genes regulating fatty acid uptake (FABP1, FATP1, and CD36) and fatty acid synthesis (SREBF1, fatty acid synthase (FAS), and ACCα), and reduced the mRNA expression of genes regulating fatty acid catabolism (adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL)); but these effects were obviously restrained by IF intervention (Figure 4F). Collectively, these findings suggested that IF was effective in reducing cardiac lipid deposition in obese mice.  3.4. IF Inhibites high fat diet (HFD)-Induced Cardiac Apoptosis  Ectopic deposition of myocardial lipids could lead to apoptosis in the heart [26,27].",3e2bc954-2ac0-47e1-a90e-2eb722e5b2cc
12,methods12," transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining revealed that high fat diet (HFD)-induced positive apoptotic particles were downregulated by IF intervention (Figure 5A,B). Consistently, western blot analysis showed that Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Cleaved Caspase-3 protein expression were significantly increased in the high fat diet (HFD) group compared to the ND group. However, IF significantly restored these effects (Figure 5C–E). These results demonstrated that obesity-induced apoptosis in cardiac tissues could be inhibited by IF intervention.  3.5. IF Decreases high fat diet (HFD)-Induced Cardiac m6A Methylation  To assess the effect of IF on m6A methylation, we measured m6A content and m6A-associated genes and proteins in cardiac tissues. IF intervention markedly rescued m6A content in the heart from high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice (Figure 6A).",7db50c08-af89-4f34-927e-89da0281a557
13,methods13," Additionally, the gene expression of METTL3 was up-regulated by high fat diet (HFD), and the fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) mRNA levels was down-regulated; however, IF intervention markedly reversed high fat diet (HFD)-induced these effects, which were also confirmed by western blot (Figure 6B–D). Taken together, these results indicated that IF intervention decreases cardiac m6A methylation levels in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.  4. Discussion  As we know, cardiac tissueis the major attacking target of obesity. high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity cardiomyopathy is characterized by abnormal heart structure and dysfunction [2,3]. Increasing evidence suggests the protective effect of IF in obesity cardiomyopathy [28,29,30]; however, its molecular mechanism is not yet fully clarified. In the present study, we examined the therapeutic effect of IF on obesity cardiomyopathy as well as its impact on lipid deposition and m6A methylation in the heartof obese mice.",d11857f1-1b75-4ab9-b3bf-d977734cd590
14,methods14," Our study revealed that IF intervention protected against high fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid deposition, apoptosis, and m6A methylation in cardiac tissues, as a result, restored cardiac functional and structural impairment. Mechanistically, IF may regulate myocardial lipid metabolism and apoptosis through m6A methylation in obesity cardiomyopathy. The present study, in part, shows that the protective effects of IF in cardiovascular protection may be involved in m6A RNA methylation.  Long-term high fat diet (HFD) induces obese cardiomyopathy, leading to cardiac abnormal structure and dysfunction. Our results indicated that 8 weeks of IF intervention in obese mice could attenuate cardiac diastolic and systolic dysfunction, morphological abnormalities, and interstitial fibrosis. It was reported that the disorder of myocardial lipid metabolism is considered to be the major pathogenesis of obesity cardiomyopathy [3].",196914ce-d959-4342-8794-fd3fcfe25ea3
15,methods15," Previous studies have shown that serum lipid metabolism disorders in obese mice, such as increased levels of TC, TG, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and Free fatty acid (FFA) [31,32]. Furthermore, 24-week high fat diet (HFD) resulted in increased cardiac TG content and LDs number and induced lipotoxic cardiomyopathy [33]. Similarly, in our results, abnormal serum lipid metabolism and cardiac lipid deposition were examined in obese mice but were ameliorated by IF intervention. Lipid synthesis and breakdown are highly regulated multistep reactions, with a pathway involving distinct sets of enzymatic reactions. Obesity induces the breakdown of the dynamic balance of myocardial lipid synthesis and decomposition and the abnormal transcription of the cardiac lipid accumulation, lipid synthesis, and catabolism genes [34].",6f4a8c95-4086-402f-b2df-7e0101aecb0f
16,methods16," We found that IF decreased the mRNA levels of fatty acid uptake genes of FABP1, FATP1, and CD36, the fatty acid synthesis genes of SREBF1, fatty acid synthase (FAS), and ACCα, and increased the gene expression of fatty acid catabolism genes of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Therefore, we speculated that IF alleviates high fat diet (HFD)-induced cardiac lipid deposition by decreasing fatty acid uptake and synthesis and increasing fatty acid catabolism.  Myocardial lipid accumulation has been reported to promote myocardial apoptosis [35]. Previous research has shown that myocardial apoptosis increased in obese rats, as evidenced by an up-regulated transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and Cleaved Caspase-3 protein expression [36].",3d21b146-362c-4d67-9045-761af6ccb4f3
17,methods17," Another study reported that food restriction decreased transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and Cleaved Caspase-3 protein expression, which could inhibit cardiac apoptosis in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats [28]. Similarly, in our study, transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and western blot analysis showed that cardiac lipid deposition significantly increased cardiac apoptotic cell death, and IF intervention markedly reversed high fat diet (HFD)-induced these effects. In sum, IF appeared to inhibit HDF-induced cardiac apoptosis, but its underlying mechanism at the epitranscriptomic modification is not fully understood yet.  Growing evidence revealed that m6A methylation is related to obesity and lipid metabolic [37,38].",7bd12b47-f169-4e93-bef8-83fe7cce9dfc
18,methods18," Previous study has shown that the mRNA and protein expression of fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) were upregulated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) rats, which were involved in lipid metabolism disorders [39]. The m6A methylation levels and METTL3 expression were raised in the livers of obese mice, and hepatocyte-specific knockout of METTL3 improved lipid metabolic disorders and insulin resistance [40]. A recent study showed that YTHDC2, an m6A reader, was significantly down-regulated in the livers of obese mice and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Overexpression of YTHDC2 in the livers of obese mice improved hepatic lipid metabolism and insulin resistance [41]. In addition, increased m6A methylation levels were up-regulated in the impaired cardiovascular system and were involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, leading to cardiac apoptosis and dysfunction [20].",de738c05-4aad-4c53-93c7-39294dc464b9
19,methods19," A recent study has revealed that m6A methylated levels were up-regulated and the gene and protein levels of fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) were reduced in human and mouse failing hearts, while fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) overexpression significantly decreased fibrosis and enhanced cardiomyocyte contractile function [42]. The m6A levels and METTL3 expression were up-regulated in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated cultured H9C2 cells and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mouse hearts. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of METTL3 promoted autophagic flux and reduced apoptosis in I/R mice [43]. Our study revealed that m6A methylation levels and METTL3 were consistently up-regulated, and fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) was consistently reduced in cardiac tissueof high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. It is worth noting that IF intervention markedly reversed high fat diet (HFD)-induced these effects.",f837eadc-6844-4a1d-b927-599fb1dc08f6
20,methods20," We speculate that down-regulation the expression of METTL3 and up-regulation the expression of fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) may be responsible for altered m6A levels in the high fat diet (HFD)-IF group. Additionally, it has been reported that IF can improve metabolic diseases such as obesity and aging by regulating epigenetic modifications [44,45]. Therefore, it is thought that IF may ameliorate high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity cardiomyopathy via decreasing m6A RNA methylation.  As indicated above, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the effects of IF on m6A RNA methylation. Together, these results provide a novel pathological mechanism of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity cardiomyopathy and suggest that reducing m6A methylation levels through intermittent fasting intervention is a therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated myocardial lipid deposition and apoptosis.",49bddc33-d6f0-4f82-8c2b-e9bb495f83d7
21,methods21," Our study may help to design better non-pharmacological intervention protocols for obesity cardiomyopathy patients. However, one limitation of our manuscript is that it only detected the expression of m6A-associated genes and proteins by RT-PCR and western blot but did not conduct a genome-wide profiling of m6A-tagged transcripts in cardiac tissueby methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). Moreover, the molecular mechanism by which IF can attenuate cardiac lipid deposition and apoptosis via m6A methylation in obesity cardiomyopathy will need to be explored in further study.  5. Conclusions  In summary, our results demonstrate that IF attenuated cardiac lipid deposition and apoptosis, as well as improved cardiac functional and structural impairment in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity cardiomyopathy, by a mechanism associated with decreased m6A RNA methylation levels (Figure 7).
