0,abstract0," Diabetes is a global, costly, and growing public health issue. Intermittent fasting (IF) and exercise therapy have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity (IS) in large studies, although the underlying processes are still unknown. The goal of this study, which included both nondiabetic and diabetic rats, was to look at the mechanisms of intermittent fasting and exercise in the management of diabetotoxicity. The effects of starvation and honey on the oral glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, adipocytokines, oxidative glucose metabolic enzymes, glycolytic enzymes, food intake, and body weight in rats with streptozotocin‐induced diabetes were also investigated.

At all oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) points, there was a substantial rise in glucose in the STZ group. Adipocytokines hormone, oxidative glucose metabolic enzymes, glycolytic enzymes, and body weight were all affected by STZ when compared to starvation and honey, however, IF and exercise significantly reduced these alterations. In diabetic rats, intermittent fasting and exercise enhanced serum adipocytokines levels. These findings imply that adipokines modulate glycolytic/nonmitochondrial enzymes and glucose metabolic/mitochondrial dehydrogenase to mediate the antidiabetic effects of intermittent fasting and exercise.",6968be14-a39d-40f3-8a5e-2065b5b7fdd9

3,abstract3," ==== Body pmc1 INTRODUCTION  Fasting hyperglycemia decreased insulin secretion, and insulin receptor insensitivity are all symptoms of diabetes mellitus, a metabolic condition . Diabetes mellitus is reported to impact more than 100 million individuals worldwide and is one of the world's top five causes of death (Otovwe & Akpojubaro, 2020; Yang et al., 2019). Persistent hyperglycemia in diabetics has been shown to generate excessive reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) generation in many organs by glucose auto‐oxidation and/or protein glycation . In animal models and humans with diabetes, there have also been findings of altered antioxidative enzyme activity and enhanced lipid peroxidation (Kade et al., 2008; Prabakaran & Ashokkumar, 2013; Schmatz et al., 2012).",d968bcdd-01fc-410a-b162-9409cafa9bc3
4,abstract4," This condition is the result of issues associated with modern lifestyles, such as a high intake of processed foods, a growing geriatric population, decreased physical exercise, and obesity . Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and fatty liver disease are all more common in people who have metabolic syndrome .  Food restriction (FR) is defined as a reduction in food intake while maintaining minimal nutritional levels. In humans with T2DM (Albosta & Bakke, 2021) and animal models, it has already shown improvements in pancreatic beta‐cell activity, blood glucose control, and other parameters . Some of the various approaches utilized to create FR is intermittent fasting (IF) (Kunduraci & Ozbek, 2020) and starvation. Hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, dehydration, hypotension, and thrombosis have all been linked to diabetics who practice IF .",421304a9-6b04-4e9c-9400-8d6e2bb583ac
5,abstract5," Short‐term starvation causes insulin resistance in humans, according to previous research . More interestingly, exercise and intermittent fasting have long been recognized as important non‐pharmacological tools for the treatment of diabetes (Corley et al., 2018; Harvie & Howell, 2017; Sampath Kumar et al., 2019; Sutton et al., 2018) and accepted as adjunctive therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus owing to their ability to improve insulin sensitivity and insulin‐stimulated muscle glucose uptake, both of which improve glucose utilization . As a result, elucidating the mechanisms underlying this type of intermittent fasting and exercise therapy‐related improved insulin sensitivity could help researchers to better understand how insulin sensitivity develops in conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes.  2 ",fec63350-10b5-42cb-8c64-707656c3057c
6,methods0,"  2.1 Animal use and handling  All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with protocols authorized by the Research Committee on the Ethical Use of Animals (DSUA Care), Reference no REC/FBMS/DELSU/21/121. The researchers employed 80 adult Sprague Dawley rats of similar age (10–12 weeks) and weight (180–250 g) for the investigation. For 2 weeks of acclimation, the rats were kept in a regular habitat with uniform husbandry and photoperiodic conditions (12 h of light and 12 h of darkness) and an ambient room temperature of 280°C–300°C. Throughout the trial, all of the rats were kept in clean wooden cages with unlimited access to water and a standard rat chow diet. The National Research Council's ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC, 2011) was utilized to ensure that the animals used in this investigation were treated as humanely as possible.  2.",3533e9b7-f98a-4a96-8635-3138dbefe422
7,methods1,"2 Chemicals  Commercially available honey (Golden Glory, Australia) was bought from a local market in Abraka, Delta State. Honey (1 g/kg/day) was diluted with distilled water before being given to the rats by gavage. Streptozotocin (STZ, 99% purity) was supplied by Sigma‐Aldrich. All other chemicals used were analytical grade and also were obtained from Sigma‐Aldrich.  2.3 Induction of diabetes  Diabetes was induced by giving a single intraperitoneal injection of low dose streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg b.w.) in freshly made 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5). To avoid hypoglycemia, these rats were given unrestricted access to standard rats’ chow during the night after being injected with streptozotocin in a solution of saccharose (10 g/100 ml). Diabetes was diagnosed 72 h after STZ injection in rats with a fasting blood glucose level of more than 200 mg/dl. This was done with the One Touch UltraEasy Blood Glucose Monitoring System and a glucometer after blood was expressed from the tail vein.",98284d67-762c-4251-9497-d9374da10441
8,methods2," The nondiabetic groups were administered intraperitoneal injection of freshly made 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5) without STZ. Four weeks after STZ or citrate buffer injections, the treatments began.  2.4 Drugs and their preparations  Honey (Aamri & Ali, 2017; Erejuwa et al., 2011) and STZ (Aamri & Ali, 2017) dosages were determined based on past dose–response effects and early investigations, and distilled water dose was chosen based on a previous study (Aamri & Ali, 2017).  2.5 Experimental design  A total of 66 rats were divided into two phases: non‐diabetic and diabetic. The nondiabetic phase is divided into five groups whereas the diabetic phase is divided into six groups consisting of six rats (n = 6) per group. The groups of the nondiabetic phase include Nondiabetic control, Intermittent fasting, Starvation, and honey (1 g/kg body weight) groups.",7023774c-7639-462d-8166-ce52eabc4b7b

At noon, the IF group's food was withdrawn or made available. For the duration of the experiment, the IF group had unlimited access to water. Bodyweight change and food intake were tracked throughout the study.  2.6.2 Starvation intervention  For 2 weeks, rat chow was withheld from a group of rats to test the effect of starving . During the protracted hunger, none of the rats died.  2.6.3 Exercise intervention  Individual cages with a running wheel (Accelerator Ltd.",f5505c49-2dce-4679-bc7a-7f635b1ae0e9
10,methods4,") were used to house the exercising animals, who had free access to the wheel for 24 h a day (method of Szalai et al., 2014). The exercising protocol was chosen to isolate the effects of exercising from the additional stress associated with forced exercise regimens. It is defined as a voluntary wheel‐running paradigm. The average running distance permitted throughout the exercising time was 4 km/day/animal for uniformity.  2.7 Measurement of body weight and food intake  The rats’ body weight was measured and documented at the start of the trial, and they were then weighed weekly with a digital weighing scale to see how much they had changed. The pancreas, liver, and heart's relative organ weights were also measured and recorded. Furthermore, daily feed intake was assessed and recorded in percentage. First, the total weight of feed provided per group was subtracted from the weight of daily feed remnants.  2.",1e4ae0cc-d76f-4340-9d42-b8cf5bafee80

37,discussion0,"  In the current investigation, STZ‐induced diabetic rats had reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as demonstrated by higher blood glucose and insulin levels at all points of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) (Abdulwahab et al., 2021; Oza & Kulkarni, 2018). The STZ induces type 2 diabetes, as well as reduced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, according to the Mahmoud et al. (2017).  Although insulin levels may be normal or even elevated in some diabetic patients, most tissues are unable to use glucose, resulting in hyperglycemia. Glucose intolerance is the medical term for this. One of the most prominent procedures for evaluating glucose intolerance is the oral glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)). It looks into problems with blood glucose regulation or glucose homeostasis.",84d55294-085d-4208-92de-df74043f4c8c
38,discussion1," The blood glucose levels of diabetic rats were considerably raised after consumption of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in this investigation (Lodhi and Kori, 2021; Germoush et al., 2019). With intermittent fasting, starvation, and exercise intervention, the concentration of blood glucose in diabetic rats was elevated to a peak after 30 min, and then restored to fasting blood glucose ranges after 60 and 120 min. Untreated diabetic rats, on the other hand, exhibited greater blood glucose levels at 30 and even 120 min. When honey‐treated diabetic rats were compared to untreated diabetic rats, it was shown that glucose levels remained higher. Intermittent fasting, starving, and exercise were found to assist increase glucose tolerance by lowering glucose absorption from the intestine, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and boosting insulin action on diverse tissues for glucose uptake, according to the findings of Albosta and Bakke (2021) and Dwaib et al. (2021).",d3f2b623-dc33-4cb7-aa77-22d9c0fa4d21
39,discussion2,"  Weight loss, muscle wasting, excessive hair loss, scaling, cataract, increased food and water consumption, polyuria, dehydration, and other symptoms are all observed in diabetic rats. In this work, the bodyweight of STZ‐induced diabetic rats was dramatically lowered. Because diabetic rat cells may be unable to use glucose for energy production due to decreased insulin action or secretion, this could be explained by higher consumption of fat and protein. Increased protein catabolism to generate amino acids for gluconeogenesis also leads to muscle waste and weight loss . In the current study, the body weight of diabetic rats was dramatically lowered. This drop could be due to structural protein breakdown, which contributes to weight gain . In STZ‐induced experimental DM, weight loss is associated to increased tissue protein breakdown and muscle degeneration .",48afd861-1a13-4928-a099-161719948eff
40,discussion3,"  The amount of food ingested by control and experimental rats was also recorded or quantified on a daily basis in this study. Food consumption rose dramatically in diabetic rats, which could be due to impaired glucose utilization by tissues, resulting in a high amount of glucose excretion through urine, which produces a persistent stimulus to eat more food. In the intermittent and activity groups, diabetic rats were less likely to lose weight and eat more food. This could be due to the fact that intermittent fasting and exercise help to manage blood sugar levels (Albosta & Bakke, 2021; Spezani et al., 2020). By decreasing calorie intake and resetting the metabolism, intermittent fasting can assist to reduce obesity and, as a result, insulin resistance.",ce096f6b-a6cd-4ad5-9381-1a9736e05ba4
41,discussion4," Furthermore, greater AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)) activation has been demonstrated to promote healthy aging and a reduction in chronic disease through energy/nutrient depletion (such as caloric restriction) . Reduced energy intake, such as that obtained through intermittent fasting, should result in long‐term reductions in insulin production, as seen in this study, as well as increased levels of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is thought to play a role in improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, as seen in this study. (Larson‐Meyer et al., 2006) discovered that in overweight, glucose‐tolerant persons, a 25% reduction in calories, either by diet alone or diet combined with exercise, enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced cell sensitivity.  Several obesity studies, on the other hand, have found that humans have a hard time sticking to a daily calorie restriction for long periods of time (Anton et al.",ec6cfdd2-ae33-43a4-b677-3482125c8353
42,discussion5,", 2017). Intermittent fasting, on the other hand, has a higher compliance rate and has been shown to help obese people improve metabolic risk factors, body composition, and weight loss (Albosta & Bakke, 2021; Anton et al., 2017; Spezani et al., 2020). The shift in the body's main fuel source during fasting from glucose to fatty acids and ketones has been related to these favorable outcomes. .  We measured serum adiponectin and ghrelin levels in diabetic rats to better understand the physiological mechanisms by which intermittent fasting and exercise exert their therapeutic intervention on serum glucose and insulin levels. Adipokines are involved in energy homeostasis and the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, immunity, neuroendocrine function, insulin‐sensitization, anti‐inflammatory, and antiatherogenic function, and cardiovascular function (Duszka et al., 2021; Dwaib et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021; Di Sessa et al., 2019; Spezani et al., 2020;).",e2eceda1-1cbe-4f5b-8188-3cbec6426390
43,discussion6," In research, adiponectin was found to affect insulin sensitivity in diabetic mice . Adiponectin levels are low in persons with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease . In this investigation, diabetic rats experienced a considerable drop in serum adiponectin, as previously reported . Lower serum levels of adiponectin and ghrelin have been associated with insulin resistance, poor insulin sensitivity, and the genesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes . For 4 weeks, diabetic rats who fasted intermittently and exercised had greater blood levels of adiponectin and ghrelin (Ouerghi et al., 2021; Stensel, 2010). Improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, hepatic glucose production, and peripheral glucose uptake were associated to this (Polito et al., 2020; Stensel, 2010).",35301950-8df3-412b-86f8-be92c420f250
44,discussion7," According to current data, ghrelin may play a function in metabolic syndrome (Ukkola, 2009). In a range of pathophysiological situations, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic abnormalities, ghrelin concentrations have been demonstrated to be lowered . Insulin has been proven to decrease ghrelin release in healthy normal‐weight and overweight adults (St‐Pierre et al., 2007; Weickert et al., 2008). Hyperinsulinemia with simultaneous hyperglycemia has no influence on plasma ghrelin at concentrations seen in insulin‐resistant patients, according to a prior study, but only at pharmacological insulin doses. Because ghrelin has been found to drive adipogenesis in vitro, the decline in adiponectin could be attributable to a drop in ghrelin levels (Mano‐Otagiri et al., 2009).",96f888a0-3620-40ac-b55c-242a8d57a2b3
45,discussion8," By suppressing gluconeogenesis and boosting lipid oxidation, adiponectin has been demonstrated to increase AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)), resulting in better insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism regulation . Adiponectin also suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis by lowering the expression of glucose‐6‐phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, lowering hepatic glucose production . Through these processes, adiponectin and ghrelin contribute to enhanced insulin‐induced signal transduction and hence improved insulin sensitivity .  Irisin, a new adipocytokine, is released, activated, and transported to a variety of tissues and organs to carry out its physiological tasks.",a5d83924-c609-4b15-8163-fe52837c5098
46,discussion9," It can, for example, improve insulin resistance, boost uncoupling protein‐1 expression, convert white fat into brown fat with catabolic properties, increase energy consumption and glucose utilization, and coordinate the treatment of metabolic illnesses like obesity and type 2 diabetes (Jung et al., 2017; Rizk et al., 2016; Xuan et al., 2020).  As a result, unlike starvation, exercise and intermittent fasting can improve insulin resistance and have a modest hypoglycemic impact, as revealed in our work. This could be due to exercise increasing irisin secretion in skeletal muscle (Liu et al., 2021; Sousa et al., 2021; Xuan et al., 2020). Our findings revealed that STZ‐induced diabetic rats had lower irisin levels than non‐diabetic controls, which was consistent with and similar to the findings of most previous studies in animals and humans when compared to nondiabetic controls (Choi et al., 2013; Elizondo‐Montemayor et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2013; Moreno‐Navarrete et al., 2013; Yan et al.",5e9a8ed8-c0b0-4f7e-b420-a5c2e6aeba90
47,discussion10,", 2014; Zhang et al., 2016; Xuan et al., 2020). When diabetic rats were compared to nondiabetic control rats, non‐pharmacological therapies such as intermittent fasting and exercise were observed to generate an increase in serum irisin. Intermittent fasting/exercise‐related elevated serum irisin has been connected to improved metabolic health, insulin signaling, glucose homeostasis, and other glycemic profile in animal STZ‐models of diabetes, making it a prospective target in the management of metabolic diseases.  The glycolysis pathway, which starts with hexokinase phosphorylating glucose to glucose 6‐phosphate, is the core of cellular metabolism (HK). In energy metabolism, the isoenzyme HK plays a crucial function. In mammalian cells, hexokinases (HKs) are four isoforms of hexokinases that are involved in glucose oxidation (Wilson, 1995). The activity of HK I‐III is regulated by the cell's glucose 6‐phosphate concentration, which acts as a feedback inhibitor.",06ebd6a1-f711-46e5-aa6a-872510dcfc2c
48,discussion11," Insulin, glucagon, and glucokinase regulatory protein regulate the activity of HK‐IV, commonly known as glucokinase, which has a low affinity for glucose yet phosphorylates it predominantly (Collier & Scott, 2004). HK‐I and HK‐IV are expressed more in the liver than the other HKs. Previous research has shown that liver HK is important for glucose consumption and glycogen production (Postic, 2001), and that its activity is decreased in diabetes. The liver activity of diabetic rats was shown to be significantly lower in this investigation. A decrease in insulin sensitivity and an increase in insulin resistance could be to blame. After intervention with intermittent fasting and exercise, the HK activity in the liver of diabetic rats was dramatically increased. Intermittent fasting and exercise may have activated insulin sensitivity for glucose reuptake by the cells, resulting in this rise.",327deb24-f0ab-44e6-bde9-4f88a630c93a
49,discussion12," Intermittent fasting and exercise enhanced glucose metabolism and glucose homeostasis by boosting HK activity in the liver.  Pyruvate kinase (PK) transforms phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and generates ATP. L (liver‐type), R (red blood cell‐type), M1 (muscle‐type), and M2 (muscle‐type) are the four isoforms of PK (muscle‐type). Yamada and Noguchi (1998) showed that PK‐L is expressed greatest in the liver and lowest in the kidneys, pancreatic b‐cells, and small intestine, whereas PK‐R is exclusively present in red blood cells. PK‐M1 is present in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, while PK‐M2 is found in other tissues . In persons with diabetes, reduced PK activity may be the reason for impaired glucose metabolism and ATP generation. The current study found a considerable reduction in PK activity in the livers of STZ‐induced diabetic rats, resulting in decreased glycolysis and enhanced gluconeogenesis.",16aa4b2f-74b0-48df-82a3-31133da1efeb
50,discussion13," Earlier research had yielded similar findings (Palsamy & Subramanian, 2009; Prasath & Subramanian, 2011; Srinivasan et al., 2014). The PK activity in the livers of diabetic rats was recovered to near‐normal levels with intermittent fasting and exercise.  The enzyme G6Pase (glucose‐6‐phosphatase) is essential for glucose homeostasis. Bouché et al. (2004) identified it largely in the liver and kidney, where it aids in glucose production during famine or prolonged fasting, as well as diabetes mellitus. G6Pase is engaged in the glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways’ dephosphorylation step, where glucose‐6‐phosphate is transformed to free glucose. This enzyme, which is connected to the glucose‐6‐phosphate transporter, hydrolyzes glucose‐6‐phosphate into glucose and phosphate in the endoplasmic reticulum . G6Pase is activated by cAMP, whereas insulin inhibits it.",bbf6d925-a932-467e-847f-d6b233c0d83c
51,discussion14," Similar to prior investigations, the current study discovered a considerable increase in G6Pase activity in the liver of STZ‐induced diabetic rats (Palsamy & Subramanian, 2009; Prasath & Subramanian, 2011; Srinivasan et al., 2014). Intermittent fasting and exercise brought G6Pase activity back to near‐normal levels in diabetic mice. Fructose‐1,6‐bisphosphatase (F1,6BP) is a rate‐limiting enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway that dephosphorylates fructose‐1,6‐bisphosphate to fructose‐6‐phosphate. It is usually present in the liver and kidney, but it can also be found in the b‐cells of the pancreas. In this investigation, the activity of F1,6BP in the liver of STZ‐induced diabetic rats was found to be considerably higher.  This result is in line with prior findings (Palsamy & Subramanian, 2009; Prasath & Subramanian, 2011; Srinivasan et al., 2014).",680739a6-6c89-415c-b17a-2e5cb73c1039
52,discussion15," Increased F1,6BP activity may be a mechanism to initiate endogenous glucose production from glycerol via gluconeogenesis during diabetes . Intermittent fasting and exercise drastically lowered F1,6BP activity in diabetic rats’ livers, restoring glucose homeostasis by limiting gluconeogenesis via gluconeogenic substrates while blocking direct impacts on glycolysis, glycogenolysis, and the citric acid cycle.  During anaerobic glycolysis, which occurs both in the cytosol and in the mitochondria, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) converts pyruvate to lactate to provide energy (Bouché et al., 2004; Kavanagh et al., 2004; Kavanagh et al., 2004). H (heart‐type) and M (muscle‐type) are the two subunits of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and their synthesis is controlled by two distinct genes. Glucose, insulin, and NADH limit lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, whereas cytosolic ATP, Ca2+, and mitochondrial membrane potential boost it .",c1f6db5e-9657-4fad-9154-13d251b4ba14
53,discussion16," Reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in tissues may be needed to confirm that glycolysis produces a high ratio of NADH and pyruvate, which is oxidized by mitochondria. In this work, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was observed to be considerably higher in the livers of STZ‐induced diabetic rats. Similar findings have been seen in other studies (Palsamy & Subramanian, 2009; Prasath & Subramanian, 2011). Diabetes‐related increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity may disrupt glucose metabolism and reduce insulin sensitivity. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the liver of diabetic rats was returned to near‐normal by manipulating the ratio of NADH and pyruvate with intermittent fasting and exercise. As a result, the process of glucose (pyruvate) oxidation in the mitochondria is improved.  G6PDH is a pentose phosphate pathway regulator that creates NADPH, which is needed to restore reduced glutathione from oxidized glutathione.",e8e70653-4b61-4fa5-9b32-deb563b028dc
54,discussion17,"  According to an earlier study, NADPH produced by G6PDH is essential for the generation of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) such as superoxide and nitric oxide radicals in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues, as well as their eradication by catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (Park et al.,2006). Glutathione levels have been associated to reduce oxidative stress and G6PDH activity (Dora et al., 2021; Nóbrega‐Pereira et al., 2016). In this work, the activity of G6PDH in the liver of diabetic rats was found to be considerably lower. This finding is in line with earlier research (Palsamy & Subramanian, 2009; Prasath & Subramanian, 2011; Srinivasan et al., 2014). The reduced activity of G6PDH could possibly contribute to the advancement of diabetes complications. With intermittent physical exercise, G6PDH activity in diabetic rats was considerably increased to near‐normal levels.",be98fb53-04e0-4203-962a-0df6054c65c8
55,discussion18," Furthermore, both intermittent fasting and exercise treatments boosted hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activity in the diabetic rats’ livers while lowering glucose‐6‐phosphatase and fructose‐1,6‐biphosphatase. Diabetes increases the rate of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, resulting in higher hepatic glucose production . Hexokinase activity was found to be lower and glucose‐6‐phosphatase activity was shown to be higher in previous studies, resulting in lower liver glycogen and hyperglycemia . Increased insulin production with a matching rise in insulin resistance, which activates the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathways, is another mechanism contributing to a decrease in liver glycogen (Mahmoud et al., 2015; Pari & Murugan, 2005).",886cc844-e822-49fd-b606-3fca8a0f5f12
56,discussion19,"  The drop in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity generated by STZ‐induced oxidative stress suggests a decrease in succinate to fumarate conversion, reflecting a decrease in oxidative metabolism. The synthesis of fumarate is increased when phosphoenolpyruvate is diverted during a stressful scenario, resulting in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) product inhibition . succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity may be reduced in diabetic rats’ tissues due to enzymatic failure caused by lipid peroxidation activation. This could be owing to an excess of free radicals created in response to the harmful effects. Diabetic rats on a non‐pharmacological intermittent fasting and exercise program had higher succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity than diabetic rats on a pharmacological intermittent fasting and exercise regimen. The antioxidant‐boosting benefits of intermittent fasting and exercise could be to blame for this increase (Allen et al., 2020; Nurmasitoh et al.",8d0f5974-bda3-4f6a-9ed1-3e4affb69543
57,discussion20,", 2018; Shahandeh et al., 2013). Furthermore, higher succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in diabetic rats during intermittent fasting and exercise suggests that the TCA cycle is more efficient at using energy‐producing intermediates. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH)) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to ‐ketoglutarate, which requires either NAD+or NADP+to create NADH and NADPH, respectively . NADPH is necessary for the operation of the NADPH‐dependent thioredoxin system and the regeneration of reduced glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) by glutathione reductase, both of which are vital in the protection of cells against oxidative damage . As a result, during oxido‐nitrergic stress, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) could operate as an antioxidant.",4824f771-8c53-4f6d-ac23-d84339058833
58,discussion21," By providing NADPH for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) protects mitochondrial, and cytosolic oxidative damage . As a result of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) damage, the equilibrium between oxidants and antioxidants may be disrupted, resulting in a prooxidant state. In STZ‐induced diabetes rats, the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH)) was assessed, and it was found to be considerably lower in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic control group. Rajeswarareddy et al. (2012) published similar findings, indicating that diabetic group mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) activity was lower than nondiabetic control group. The glycation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) can prevent it from performing its function. Glycation aids the inactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) by reactive oxygen species.",6eda3e91-d31e-4c7d-8da2-2d4857e4be90
59,discussion22," After non‐pharmacological treatments with intermittent fasting and exercise, the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) was normalized when compared to the diabetes control group. This could be attributed to intermittent fasting and exercise's antioxidant‐enhancing or mediating activity in reducing diabetes complications.  6 ",2409565c-8745-4d98-ba14-431e6a2542ab
60,conclusion0," In conclusion, our findings show for the first time that nonpharmacological therapeutic regimens such as intermittent fasting and exercise improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in STZ‐induced type 2 diabetic rats by maintaining insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, whereas starvation had more hypoglycemic effects, resulting in increased weight loss. The honey‐treated rats show higher diabetes‐related symptoms. Intermittent fasting and exercise boosted peripheral glucose absorption, decreased hepatic glucose production, regulated glucose metabolic enzymes, and raised the activity of liver glycolytic enzymes in diabetic rats. In diabetic rats, intermittent fasting, and exercise enhanced serum adipocytokines levels. These findings imply that adipokines modulate glycolytic/nonmitochondrial enzymes and glucose metabolic/mitochondrial dehydrogenase to mediate the antidiabetic effects of intermittent fasting and exercise.",b1c80458-fab5-448b-a940-948f4fe09e79
