0,methods0,"2.1. Search Strategy The literature search was conducted as per the recommended protocol by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) (Supplementary Table S1). Data were extracted by two investigators (S.M. and C.-M.O). Before the data extraction, two reviewers (S.M., C.-M.O.) refined the data extraction tables. S.M. and C.-M.O. searched citation databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, using the same terms on the same day and crosschecked for accuracy (inception to April 3, 2020). S.M. and C.-M.O. extracted data independently using the predefined tables for data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third investigator (T.K.). In addition, we conducted Google searches for gray literature. No language restrictions were placed on the searches.",8e1c86d6-60b2-4b10-8ac5-b0c103aa905e
1,methods1," Search terms included combinations of “time restricted feeding”, “time restricted diet”, or “time restricted eating”, and “weight”, “obesity”, “blood pressure”, “hypertension”, “insulin”, “glucose”, “diabetes”, “cholesterol”, “triglycerides”, or “dyslipidemia” (Supplementary Table S2).  2.2. Study Selection We included studies with the following characteristics: (1) Population: adults aged 20 years or older; (2) Intervention: a daily fasting period of 12–20 h; (3) Comparators: control group in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomized controlled trials, or subjects before Time restricted eating (TRE) intervention in studies with a one group pretest–posttest design; (4) Outcomes: data on changes in at least one of the following: weight, blood pressure, hypertension, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),",6023c315-7da7-4122-95ea-c11e1e2205f5
2,methods2," or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); (5) Study design: clinical trials using Time restricted eating (TRE). We defined Time restricted eating (TRE) intervention as fasting for 12–20 h because generally people eat 3 times a day over a 12 hour period.  We excluded studies with the following characteristics: (1) articles on animal studies or in vivo experiments, only abstracts, and non-original articles including expert opinions or reviews; (2) studies with insufficient information on the Time restricted eating (TRE) regimen; (3) studies including intermittent or periodic fasting/energy restriction; (4) studies on religious fasting including Ramadan fasting; and (5) studies including participants with acute or chronic diseases, such as gastrointestinal diseases or cancer, that affected the outcomes. Based on these criteria we excluded 1569 studies and, finally, performed meta-analysis using 19 studies (Figure 1).  2.3.",5bfd276a-048c-4abd-8476-80add4c31491
3,methods3," Data Extraction The following variables were independently extracted by these investigators using the same criteria: first author, publication year, characteristics of the participants, number of study participants, mean age, sex, anthropometric data, body composition, blood pressure, fasting glucose concentration, and lipid profile.  2.4. Quality Assessment We used the “Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (ROB-2.0)” tool to assess the quality of RCTs and “Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I)” tool to assess non-randomized studies [25].

4,methods4," Data Analyses and Statistical Methods The pooled effect sizes were presented as mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the mean with standard deviation (SD) values before and after Time restricted eating (TRE) intervention considering the heterogeneity of study participants and measurement of outcomes. Inter-study heterogeneity was tested using Cochrane Q statistic and quantified by Higgins I2 statistic. An I2 statistic of 50% or higher indicated heterogeneity. Publication bias was examined with a funnel plot and Egger’s test, and sensitivity analysis was performed. Considering the heterogeneity of study participants, subgroup analysis was performed by metabolical health status. All analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).  3. Results 3.1. Study Characteristics The literature search yielded 1585 (PubMed: 659, EMBASE: 178, Cochrane Library: 748) articles, after excluding 212 duplicate studies.",49d4254f-3cd9-4da2-8cee-d00696b293a0
5,methods5," After excluding articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 1373 studies were assessed for eligibility. Upon further review and quality assessment, we found 21 studies that met the topic of interest. Among the 21 studies [23,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45], two were excluded for meta-analysis [26,27]. Their main results have been summarized in Supplementary Table S3. Finally, 16 studies from a database search and 3 studies from a Google search were included in the meta-analysis (11 RCTs, 2 non-randomized controlled trials, 1 historically controlled trial, 5 trials with one group pretest–posttest design) (Figure 1).  A total of 475 participants were included in this study, 219 of whom were men. There were 10 studies on healthy individuals and 9 studies on participants with metabolic abnormality (eight studies on patients with overweight/obesity, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome, and one study on patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).",02799225-d1f4-40bf-9677-2c542019be98
6,methods6," The demographics and clinical characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1.  3.2. Quality Assessment The risk of bias for the RCTs is reported in Figure 2A. Eight studies had low risk of bias and three studies had some concern of the risk of bias. Two RCTs had some concerns of bias due to the lack of data about the randomization process [28,36]. One RCT had some concerns of bias arising from the randomization procedure and missing outcome data [39]. The risk of bias for the non-randomized trials is shown in Figure 2B. Two of three non-randomized controlled trials had the moderate risks of bias [37,39] and one had the serious risk [44]. Five trials with a one group pretest–posttest design had a serious risk of bias [23,29,32,34,42].  3.3. Effect of Time restricted eating (TRE) on Obesity and Body Composition Twelve studies with 294 participants reported changes in weight with Time restricted eating (TRE) (Figure 3). The MD using a fixed effect model was −0.",1b97f896-765f-4985-9f26-0de9550036cb

The funnel plot was symmetric, and no publication bias was found (Egger’s test: p = 0.14; Supplementary Figure S1A). In the subgroup analysis according to metabolically healthy status, the subgroup with five studies including participants with metabolic abnormality [28,33,34,35,38] showed significant reduction of body weight (MD, −3.19; 95% CI, −4.62 to −1.77; I2, 0%) while the subgroup with seven studies including healthy participants [31,38,39,40,42,43,44] did not show significant change of body weight (MD, 0.17; 95% CI, −0.81 to 1.15; I2, 0%). In sensitivity analysis, one study [33] showed a significant effect on result. When it was removed, statistical significance disappeared (MD, −0.01; 95% CI, −0.95 to 0.93, Supplementary Figure S2A).",24bc84b5-5d19-442a-b96d-4370781414f3
8,methods8,"  Ten studies [23,29,31,33,37,38,39,40,41,44] with 241 participants reported changes in body composition. Time restricted eating (TRE) significantly lowered fat percentage without significant heterogeneity among studies (MD: −0.56, 95% CI: −0.95 to −0.17, I2: 0%; Figure 4A). Fat mass was also significantly reduced (MD: −1.58, 95% CI: −2.64 to −0.51, Figure 4B), and there was heterogeneity among studies (I2: 61.7%). Significant publication bias was not observed (Egger’s test: p = 0.46; Supplementary Figure S1B). In the subgroup analysis according to metabolically healthy status, the subgroup with five studies including healthy participants [29,31,39,40,41] showed significant reduction of fat mass without heterogeneity (MD: −0.79, 95% CI: −1.44 to −0.14; I2, 0%). Among two studies including metabolic abnormality, one [33] showed significant effect of Time restricted eating (TRE) on fat mass reduction.",53e8b33b-030f-40fb-9a47-82c0b622328d
9,methods9," However, the other study [37] failed to show a significant result although Time restricted eating (TRE) tended to lower fat mass. In the sensitivity analysis, one heterogeneous study was identified [33]. When the single outlier study was removed, statistical significance was maintained with the I2 reduced to 0% (MD: −0.82, 95% CI: −1.47 to −0.18; Supplementary Figure S2B). There was no significant change in fat-free mass according to Time restricted eating (TRE) (Figure 4C).  3.4. Effect of Time restricted eating (TRE) on Cardiometabolic Parameters Six studies [23,34,37,40,43,45] with 97 participants reported the effect of Time restricted eating (TRE) on blood pressure. Time restricted eating (TRE) significantly lowered systolic blood pressure without significant heterogeneity among studies (Table 2). Significant publication bias was not observed (Egger’s test: p = 0.92).",383b0b69-ff5d-429b-aaea-e6d894e12f3b
10,methods10," Subgroup analysis with four studies [23,34,37,45] including participants with metabolic abnormality showed significant change of systolic blood pressure (MD, −5.42; 95% CI, −9.2 to −1.6; I2: 0%; Supplementary Figure S1C). Two studies [40,43] with healthy participants failed to show a significant result, although Time restricted eating (TRE) tended to lower systolic blood pressure. There was no outlier study in sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Figure S2C).  The effect on fasting glucose concentration was reported in 10 studies [23,29,30,31,33,34,36,37,41,44] with 238 participants. Time restricted eating (TRE) significantly lowered fasting glucose concentration (MD, −2.96; 95% CI, −5.60 to −0.33; Table 2) and there was heterogeneity among studies (I2: 79.8%). Significant publication bias was not observed (Egger’s test: p = 0.73; Supplementary Figure S1D).",61cf149a-0ff6-4941-9add-3b00ded2764e
11,methods11," In the subgroup analysis according to metabolically heatlh status, the subgroup with five studies including participants with metabolic abnormality [23,33,34,36,37] showed significant change of fasting glucose concentration (MD, −2.29; 95% CI, −4.29 to −0.19; I2: 2.2%). However, five studies with healthy participants [29,30,31,41,44] did not show significant change although they tended to lower the fasting glucose concentration (MD, −3.65; 95% CI, −7.65 to 0.35; I2, 0%). In sensitivity analysis, the statistical significance remained after omitting each study (Supplementary Figure S2D).  Fourteen studies [23,28,29,30,31,32,33,36,37,40,41,44,45] with 343 participants reported changes in lipid profiles with Time restricted eating (TRE). Triglyceride levels significantly decreased with significant heterogeneity (MD: −11.60, 95% CI: −23.30 to −0.27, I2: 81.5%; Table 2). Significant publication bias was not observed (Egger’s test: p = 0.28; Supplementary Figure S1E).",3b099924-abb8-4ff4-8f7a-494b70641523
12,methods12," In subgroup analysis according to metabolically healthy status, there were no significant results in both subgroups (subgroup with five studies including participants with metabolic abnormality [23,32,33,37,45], MD: −7.12, 95% CI: −32.33 to 18.09, I2: 81.5%; subgroup with five studies including healthy subjects [28,30,31,40,41], MD: −13.22, 95% CI: −26.94 to 0.50, I2: 88.3%). There was no outlier study in sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Figure S2E). There were no significant changes in LDL-C and HDL-C levels (Table 2).  3.5. Subgroup Analysis with Controlled Clinical Trials Subgroup analysis was conducted with controlled clinical trials (11 RCTs and 3 controlled clinical trials without randomization). Although the effect of Time restricted eating (TRE) on the weight change was not significant, Time restricted eating (TRE) reduced fat mass compared to the control group (MD: −1.27, 95% CI: −1.96 to −0.59, I2: 0%; Table 3) without heterogeneity among studies.",01b7a797-bdd8-4fe4-8c92-30295a4f7982
13,methods13," There was no significant change in fat-free mass according to Time restricted eating (TRE). The effect on fasting glucose concentration was reported in nine studies, and there was no significant change (Table 3). In 10 studies with lipid profiles, there were no significant changes in triglycerides, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels (Table 3).   4. Discussion To determine the beneficial effects of Time restricted eating (TRE), we selected 19 clinical studies by a systemic review and performed a meta-analysis. The results of this analysis showed that Time restricted eating (TRE) is an effective treatment strategy for patients who are overweight and obese. Participants using a Time restricted eating (TRE) schedule lost bodyweight and showed a decrease in fat mass. Time restricted eating (TRE) significantly lowered systolic blood pressure and glucose concentration. Time restricted eating (TRE) also changed the lipid profiles of participants.",3fb3c77a-ba85-43d5-9e5c-c36bd5017819
14,methods14," Although LDL-C and HDL-C levels did not show significant differences, triglyceride levels were significantly decreased after Time restricted eating (TRE).  To overcome the heterogenic nature of our participants’ metabolic profiles (some are healthy young, others are unhealthy obese), we performed subgroup analysis. In the metabolic unhealthy participants, Time restricted eating (TRE) showed a significant reduction in body weight. In the healthy participants, Time restricted eating (TRE) did not show weight reduction, but still showed beneficial effects such as fat mass reduction. This means Time restricted eating (TRE) has beneficial effects on participants with or without metabolic dysfunction.  At the molecular level, circadian rhythms are generated by cell-autonomous transcription–translation feedback loops composed of multiple genes such as Clock, Bmal1, period (per), and cryptochrome (cry) [46].",63ab365e-7bd6-46d6-87f3-536edf0ecf02
15,methods15," The Clock/Bmal1 heterodimers bind to the E-box in the promoter regions of per and cry, resulting in the expression of Per and Cry proteins. They also form heterodimers in the cytoplasm to suppress the transcription of Clock and Bmal1 back in the nucleus. Bmal1 gene expression is activated by retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs) and suppressed by REV-ERBα/β. This negative feedback loop repeats approximately every 24 h, and an abnormal rate of gene expression induces shorter or longer circadian periods [47]. A Clock mutation in mice can lengthen the circadian period to as much as 27 h [48].  Mutations in clock genes in peripheral tissues can cause metabolic dysfunctions. Adiponectin and leptin levels are controlled by the molecular circadian rhythm of adipocytes. Mice with adipocyte-specific mutations in the Clock gene showed increased body weight, fat composition, and adipocyte size, as well as impaired lipolysis during fasting periods [8].",dd6aeb25-ac2b-4c40-9a81-8fc980d47cc7
16,methods16," Intestinal lipogenesis also shows circadian variations, and hypertriglyceridemia and obesity are observed in Bmal1 knock out mice [9]. Mice with both Clock gene mutation and Bmal1 deletion showed impaired glucose homeostasis with hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia [19].  Glucose homeostasis also oscillates in a daily rhythm. Decreased insulin sensitivity and glucose oxidation in the evening are caused by higher levels of postprandial free fatty acid levels in the evening compared to those in the morning [18]. Late lunch eaters show significantly less weight loss than early eaters due to decreased glucose tolerance and insulin functions during the evening [49].  In several murine animal models, feeding time changed the circadian oscillators in the peripheral tissues [50,51]. A recent clinical study also suggested that mealtime might change the central circadian clock [36]. These results emphasize the importance of the “Right Time to Eat” in health.",08bea7ce-b52f-495f-a462-e769077b508b
17,methods17," Time restricted eating (TRE) reduces body weight and improves metabolic dysfunction by repairing the disrupted circadian rhythm in people who are overweight and obese [50,52].  Time restricted eating (TRE) is a new treatment strategy for weight control without calorie reduction. This method is a potentially easier way than CR to maintain optimal body weight and health for a longer time because patients do not need to reduce total food intake or to calculate total daily kcal intake. Clinical studies have confirmed the effectiveness of this strategy. Dorothea et al. reported that Time restricted eating (TRE) was predominantly well accepted by participants [32]. In their study, 86% of participants achieved their weight target during the 3 month study period [32]. Research in animal models has shown the beneficial effects of Time restricted eating (TRE) on obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, cardiometabolic dysfunctions, and lifespan [19,46,47,48,49].",366604f0-f76a-449f-a34b-6ec9650d0cf9
18,methods18," Several pilot studies have reported the beneficial effects of Time restricted eating (TRE) in humans [19,27,37,40,41].  Intriguingly, in our study, Time restricted eating (TRE) did not reduce total mass. This implies that Time restricted eating (TRE) reduces fat mass selectively without muscle loss. This result may explain why Time restricted eating (TRE) improves metabolic dysfunction in patients who are overweight or obese, particularly because muscle mass is an important factor in controlling body weight and maintaining a metabolically healthy state [53].  Our data suggest that Time restricted eating (TRE) is a better strategy than CR diet to lose weight. According to a recent review [54], the contribution of fat-free mass loss often exceeded 35% of the total weight loss in persons with normal weight and 20%~30% of the total weight loss in persons who are overweight or obese on a CR diet.",02d300fd-000b-46ac-9ecd-7431990b7675
19,methods19," Therefore, researchers recommend that persons on a CR diet should increase physical activity and protein intake to preserve muscle mass [54]. Conversely, Time restricted eating (TRE) restored muscle function in Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly), a species of two-winged flies commonly used for circardian rhythm study, under the conditions of obesity or circadian disruption [55]. Moreover, Time restricted eating (TRE) has not been shown to reduce muscle strength in clinical studies [38,56].  Aging is associated with a gradual loss of fat-free mass and a gain of excess body fat. We refer to this condition involving high fat mass with low fat-free mass as sarcopenic obesity [57]. Time restricted eating (TRE) reduces this ratio; thus, Time restricted eating (TRE) may be a good therapeutic strategy to treat obesity in elderly patients. Animal research has provided evidence on the beneficial effects of Time restricted eating (TRE).",67f6f0bd-d305-4012-9329-731acecabc21
20,methods20," Time restricted eating (TRE) reduced intramuscular fat deposits and suppressed obesity-induced myofibril and mitochondrial defects in Drosophila [55]. Time restricted eating (TRE) has been shown to reduce whole-body fat accumulation, improve glucose homeostasis, restore cholesterol homeostasis, and improve muscle function in mouse studies [58,59].  This study had some limitations. First, most included studies had small sample sizes, and several studies had high risk of bias. Therefore, further large studies are necessary to clarify the effect of Time restricted eating (TRE) in the general population. Second, most studies were performed over a short duration. Therefore, we could not analyze the long-term benefits and safety of Time restricted eating (TRE) in terms of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and mortality. Third, we could not analyze blood parameters related to obesity and metabolic dysfunction such as adiponectin, leptin, and insulin levels because of lack of data.",1cdb88c2-0527-4efd-9b4d-140435bd0ed8
21,methods21," Last, although Time restricted eating (TRE) is one form of intermittent fasting, we could not compare Time restricted eating (TRE) to other types of intermittent fasting because of lack of data.  In conclusion, Time restricted eating (TRE) significantly reduces body weight and fat and improves metabolic parameters associated with cardiometabolic health. Further studies are needed to confirm the long-term outcomes of Time restricted eating (TRE).
