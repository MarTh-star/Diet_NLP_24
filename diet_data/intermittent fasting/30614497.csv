0,introduction0,"Glucose is the brain's main energy substrate but during fasting or energy restriction, plasma ketones (acetoacetate [AcAc] and β-hydroxybutyrate [BHB]) increase and spare brain glucose utilization (1) in part due to their oxidative efficiency and competition with pyruvate to enter the citric acid cycle (2–4). Ketones uptake by the brain is directly proportional to their plasma concentrations (5) which increases as the liver produces ketones from free fatty acids (free fatty acids (FFA)) in response to low glucose and insulin induced during dietary energy or carbohydrate restriction (6). Mild to moderate nutritional ketonemia has long been known to be beneficial for the management of severe refractory epilepsy (7). Other neurotherapeutic uses of mild-moderate ketonemia are now being investigated, especially in conditions in which brain glucose utilization deteriorates, such as during aging (8–11).",e506eb7a-aab9-46d7-8f2d-17dc8e441cd0
1,introduction1," Eight carbon medium chain fatty acids cross the blood brain barrier (12) and have anapleurotic and signaling properties independent of ketonemia (13, 14).  Medium chain triglycerides of 8 and 10 carbons are ketogenic (kMCT) because of their rapid absorption and oxidation (15, 16). kMCT transiently raise plasma ketones to 0.5–1.0 mmol/L when taken as a 10–15 g dietary supplement at meals (10, 17, 18). Plasma ketones increase in a direct dose-response relationship to the oral dose of kMCT consumed (1). Emulsifying or consuming MCT without a meal increases their ketogenic effect (1, 18).  Metabolic switching (MS) involves planned recurrent dietary energy or carbohydrate restriction. Typically, the period of reduced energy/carbohydrate intake eliminates 1–2 meals/day or involves total fasting for one to several days at a time. An exercise regimen and exogenous ketogenic supplement may also be involved.",eab4b98f-cfe7-438c-bc4a-e2179f250d1e
2,introduction2," During MS, glucose's contribution to the body's energy requirements declines and that of free fatty acid (free fatty acids (FFA)) and ketones increases (5). During periods of fasting and prolonged exercise, ketones are an important alternative fuel to glucose for the brain (19) and also peripherally (20). The mild to moderate ketonemia associated with MS may improve metabolic outcomes and perhaps brain health (21, 22).  Despite considerable research in animals, few experimental protocols for MS have been reported in humans. We have previously used an 8-h metabolic study protocol to compare the plasma ketone response after kMCT under different test conditions (18, 23, 24), so we used the same 8-h protocol to assess MS. In the present study, we hypothesized that three central aspects of MS, i.e., carbohydrate in the meal, kMCT, and meal timing, would augment the acute plasma ketone response during an 8-h test.",2c009eb2-e7ba-40b6-8a8f-3de3fa288f2c
3,introduction3," Our objective was to use an 8-h study protocol to assess the ketogenic effect of a commercially available kMCT drink in relation to: (i) the dose of kMCT, (ii) carbohydrate content of the meal, (iii) meal timing (missing breakfast vs. missing lunch), and (iv) age. The kMCT dose was in the range we have used previously and permitted a doubling of the dose with minimal side-effects (10–20 g) in one of the experiments. The effect of meal timing was assessed by extending the overnight fast till mid-day and giving the first meal of the day as lunch. In addition to the plasma ketones, glucose, insulin and free fatty acids (FFA) were also measured. ",a1856b30-8224-4279-9493-1b3bb781355c

7,methods3,"  To simplify identifying the different tests and reporting the results, we will refer to MS as the tests with kMCT and the midday meal, as distinct from the tests with kMCT and the low carbohydrate (LC) or breakfast meal. To test if the post-prandial increase in blood glucose or insulin influenced changes in plasma ketones after kMCT, we provided an iso-caloric LC meal instead of the regular high carbohydrate meal (Table 2). The LC meal consisted of three pieces of cheese and three scrambled eggs providing 3 g instead of 49 g carbohydrate. A second dose of kMCT was given at noon, with or without a meal depending on the test.  Table 2 Meal and drink composition.

After an overnight fast, an early meal (breakfast) was more effective at potentiating the ketogenic effect of MS over 8 h, compared to a delayed meal (lunch) without breakfast. When compared to our standard high carbohydrate meal, a LC meal lowered plasma glucose and insulin but had similar plasma ketone response from kMCT.  Like other kMCT preparations reported previously (18, 28), the kMCT drink used here rapidly increased plasma ketones with an equivalent ketogenic effect observed whether it was taken with a meal in the morning or at midday (Figure 1C).

26,discussion1," The ketogenic response to kMCT20 was higher than for kMCT10 in the 30 min after consuming the drink (Figure 1A), but the 20 g dose did not actually double the ketogenic response. These results confirm that although the plasma ketone response increases with the dose of MCT taken orally over a large range (10–70 g) (5), the response is not necessarily linear over a small range (10 to 20 g) and may well-depend on how it is provided with the volume of the drink playing a role (29). The timing of macronutrient absorption varies with energy density, volume and digestibility of meal and differs significantly between liquid and solid foods (30, 31).  Few experimental protocols for MS have been reported in humans. Our MS protocol described here with a first dose of kMCT in the morning without breakfast and a second dose of kMCT at noon with a meal increased the plasma ketone response by 145%.",66c74f8c-3d79-4f0a-8acd-378cbbc2dcc6
27,discussion2," Plasma glucose changes were inversely related to those of ketones suggesting that MS conditions were being met albeit over only 8 h making this protocol relatively simple to test in other study conditions.  During healthy aging, fasting plasma glucose tends to be higher and brain glucose uptake declines but brain ketone uptake does not change (32, 33). After consuming a ketogenic drink containing kMCT, older people in good health have previously been shown to have a similar plasma ketone response and oxidize carbon-13-labeled BHB at the same rate as middle-aged or young adults (34). Here we confirm that the plasma ketone response induced with kMCT while consuming a high-carbohydrate meal was unaffected by aging and this despite the usual trend toward higher plasma glucose and mild insulin resistance in older people (Figures 1–3) (33, 35).",bd71492c-b69e-45a2-a2d3-3ac46a4c97a7
28,discussion3," A daily 30 g dose of MCT taken for 6 months was not associated with more side-effects than a high oleic acid placebo and did not change compliance or cardiovascular risk markers in an older population (10), suggesting good long-term acceptability, safety and validity of the 10 and 20 g doses of kMCT tested here.  This study had some limitations. First, the metabolic response to a single dose of kMCT may not be extrapolatable to longer term consumption of MCT. However, one report showed that consumption of a ketogenic MCT drink for 2–3 months did not significantly change the plasma ketone response compared to before starting the MCT (11). Second, we did not have a Control baseline no kMCT + meal at T0 (CTL) metabolic test for the Older group, but the plasma ketone response of older people is very similar to that in young people (34).",e027922a-cd26-4df7-a19b-57b0b7c207a7
29,discussion4," Third, although adequately powered for a significant effect of the dose of MCT on plasma ketones in young adults, the number of participants was still small making the study vulnerable to type II error.  We conclude that an 8-h MS protocol involving two doses of kMCT, the first taken with breakfast and the second without lunch, increases the plasma ketone response independent of carbohydrate in the meal or age, and without affecting the insulin or free fatty acids (FFA) level. Thus, a kMCT drink can provide a robust short-term increase in ketones under various feeding conditions and might enhance the metabolic effectiveness of short-term MS or intermittent fasting.
