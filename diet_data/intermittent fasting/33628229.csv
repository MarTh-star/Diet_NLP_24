0,methods0," 2.1. Volunteers  A total of 44 omnivorous volunteers were subjected to an interventional study approved by the local Ethics Committee of Riga Stradiņš University, Latvia (No. 6-2/10/51). Routine biochemistry tests and blood counts were performed to assess the general health of all volunteers prior to joining the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: BMI < 18.5 kg/m2; abnormal levels in any of the blood biochemistry measurements that indicate severe health problems; and taking antibiotics, probiotics or dietary supplements containing trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) precursors within 2 months before the start of dietary interventions. All volunteers were informed about the aim and nature of this study. The recruitment of the volunteers and study procedures were carried out between December 2019 and June 2021.  2.2. Study Design  The schematic design of the study is presented in Figure 1.",b782a5d5-3ecb-4cb7-8894-6deb7e05d45e
1,methods1," Baseline anthropometric measurements and biochemical tests were performed in a fasted state before the planned dietary intervention. All participants were instructed to fast ≥ 10 h prior the blood sampling; drinking pure water was allowed during the fasting time. As fish consumption could interfere with the measurement of the trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) level, volunteers were asked to abstain from sea food consumption for two days prior to sampling. Participants were asked to maintain their usual levels of physical activity throughout the intervention. The research was carried out as a parallel arm study, and the volunteers were assigned to either the reference group (volunteers served as a reference group (VEG)) or fasting-mimicking diet (fasting mimicking diet (FMD)) group for 5 days. The baseline characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. Fasting plasma glucose was chosen as the main parameter for the randomization of the volunteers.",e40b6c19-bfd3-44cb-a4be-e8721f2efa57
2,methods2,"  fasting mimicking diet (FMD) as a dietary regimen was based on the plan developed by the team of Prof. Valter D. Longo [28]. Briefly, participants in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group were subjected to a 5-day hypocaloric diet that provides 34–54% of regular caloric intake (approximately 1100 kcal on the first day and approximately 800 kcal on the four subsequent days). The volunteers in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group were asked to consume primarily complex carbohydrates and unsaturated fat, but to limit protein intake (the caloric intake of these macronutrients was distributed as follows: 40–45%; 45–50%; 10–15%, respectively). The meals in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group mainly consisted of vegetables, seeds, nuts and vegetable oils. Legumes were allowed only on the first day as they are considered a protein source.",7d7db72e-bcdb-4e35-9a41-990fb82e0964
3,methods3,"  Volunteers in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group were expected to continue their usual dietary regimen, with the exception that they were asked to incorporate 4 servings (each approximately 100–125 g) of vegetables into their diet per day. The sizes of the meals, the caloric intake and the macronutrient content of the diet were otherwise unrestricted.  The volunteers subjected to this interventional study were under careful supervision throughout the study. Detailed information leaflets were prepared and distributed to volunteers, containing all the important information about the dietary intervention to which they were assigned and the list of allowed products together with their nutritional value.",57987616-570f-4c45-8fba-e749632da4d2
4,methods4," Volunteers usually ate two identical meals together (breakfast and lunch), For the evaluation of dinner, a special WhatsApp Messenger group was created, where volunteers shared photos of their meals prepared at home, which was also used as a measure of volunteer compliance.  After 5 days of dietary intervention, volunteers were weighed and blood samples in the fasted state (fasting at least 10 h prior the blood sampling) were taken. One volunteer from the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group withdrew from the study due to difficulties adhering to the dietary regimen. Samples previously taken from this volunteer were excluded from further analysis.  2.3. Determination of Biochemical Measurements  Blood sampling was carried out in the fasted state immediately before the start of the dietary intervention and the morning after the 5-day dietary intervention. The samples obtained were stored on ice and delivered to the Limited Liability Company “E.",984a1d6d-3e74-4b5c-83c5-c922eea58d02
5,methods5," GULBJA LABORATORIJA” (accredited by the Latvian National Accreditation Bureau, accreditation No. M-365) within two hours. The samples were subjected to clinical chemistry analyses. β-Hydroxybutyrate (plasma ketone bodies) was measured using a commercially available enzymatic kit (Biosystems S. A, Barcelona, Spain; Lot 39099) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the obtained plasma was 5-fold diluted. The standard curve was generated from 3-Sodium hydroxybutyrate (Alfa Aeser, Ward Hill, MA, USA) and assayed in duplicate. All samples were assayed in duplicate. The enzyme assay is based on oxidation of β-Hydroxybutyrate in the presence of NAD+, to form acetoacetate and NADH. The NADH produced is further involved in an indicator reaction that results in the formation of formazan that can be detected spectrophotometrically [36].  2.4.",1b144252-f094-4908-8897-869a0ba3100e
6,methods6," Measurement of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) Levels by UPLC/MS/MS  The concentration of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in plasma samples was determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) using the positive ion electrospray mode described previously [37,38]. In brief, the obtained blood samples were centrifuged at 3000× g for 5 min at 4 °C to separate plasma. Plasma samples were collected and stored at −80 °C, until further analysis. The samples were prepared for further analyses by deproteinization with an acetonitrile–methanol mixture (3:1, v/v), followed by vortexing and centrifugation at 13,000× g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to UPLC vials and used for UPLC/MS/MS analysis. MassLynx 4.1. software with the QuanLynx 4.1. module (Waters, Milford, PA, USA) was used for data acquisition and processing.",d00afcd3-ec8c-47c1-8ff4-cf925f059d81
7,methods7," A sample of an original data file of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) detection using UPLC/MS/MS analysis is available in Supplementary Table S1.  2.5. Data Analysis  The calculation of insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance indices was performed using homeostatic model assessment and HOMA2 Calculator (version 2.2.3, available online, developed by Diabetes Trial Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K.) [39].  Statistical analysis of the data was performed using GraphPad Prism computer software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The results are reported as the mean ± SEM. Statistical significance between two groups was evaluated using paired Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, depending on the data distribution, which was determined using Shapiro–Wilk test. Differences were considered significant when the two-sided p value was below 0.05.  3.",2d9f0494-3b9a-4dfb-8167-08c649bb722d
8,methods8," Results  All recruited volunteers were generally healthy, as baseline biochemistry measurements did not indicate any severe health-related conditions of any of the organ systems. Anthropometric measurements, on the other hand, suggested that the volunteers were slightly overweight with a mean BMI of 27.2 ± 0.7 units. The mean trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentration in plasma was 5.08 ± 0.74 μmol/L at baseline.  The measurement of plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels (Figure 2) revealed that 5 days of the regular diet supplemented with four servings of vegetables per day (volunteers served as a reference group (VEG)) did not result in significant changes in plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels, with a mean increase of 0.43 ± 0.70 μmol/L.",6d1cb5de-1da9-44d8-88a0-31a7a94e6fcc
9,methods9," In 8 out of 19 volunteers, we observed a reduction in plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels after the dietary intervention; however, 11 volunteers experienced an increase in plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels. In contrast, 75% (18 out of 24) of the volunteers who followed the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) experienced a notable reduction in plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels. Despite the fact that the interindividual variability of the baseline trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels was high, we observed a strong correlation between the plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels at baseline and the decrease in plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels for those who underwent 5 days of fasting mimicking diet (FMD).",4de98512-a70a-4574-85cf-a6b6d5fdcfb7
10,methods10," Moreover, the average plasma level of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group at the second visit was 3.01 ± 1.43 μmol/L lower than that at the first visit.  As fasting mimicking diet (FMD) as a dietary regimen is based on imitating the molecular effects of prolonged fasting, we next evaluated the effects of both diets on plasma ketone body concentrations. As shown in Figure 3A, 5 days of the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) diet resulted in only a slight increase in plasma ketone body levels from 0.11 ± 0.02 mmol/L to 0.16 ± 0.04 mmol/L. In contrast, the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group exhibited a significantly higher increase in plasma ketone body levels by 1.87 ± 0.32 mmol/L (14-fold elevation compared to baseline measurement).",406f87fa-df66-4e29-b378-1986ed6ec83f
11,methods11," We also observed a significant reduction in plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations (Figure 3B) in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group by 37 ± 8 ng/mL, which was not present in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) diet group.  To investigate the contribution of applied dietary strategies to weight loss, the volunteers were weighed before the study and after 5 days of the applicable diet. At baseline, volunteers in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group weighed 78 ± 4 kg. The baseline weight of the volunteers in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group was slightly higher (88 ± 3 kg). Only five volunteers subjected to the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) diet experienced a slight weight reduction of an average of 0.28 ± 0.15 kg of body weight (Figure 4A). However, each of the volunteers who followed fasting mimicking diet (FMD) experienced significant weight loss.",a7aae724-6ec3-46e7-a024-43f6db8b942a
12,methods12," The average weight loss in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group after 5 days of the dietary intervention was 2.8 ± 0.2 kg of body weight. These changes in body weight resulted in a more pronounced reduction in the body mass index (Figure 4B) in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group (0.90 ± 0.06 units in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group compared to 0.09 ± 0.05 units in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group).  Next, we evaluated the effects of a 5-day cycle of the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) diet and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) on metabolic parameters. Fasting plasma glucose (Figure 5A) in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group was reduced by 0.22 ± 0.12 mmol/L. Meanwhile, in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group, the lowering of fasting plasma glucose was 2.7 times more pronounced (a decrease of 0.57 ± 0.11 mmol/L).",c28c79a4-e220-488f-834e-bfab6b13b67e
13,methods13," A similar pattern was observed in plasma C-peptide levels (Figure 5B), where the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group exhibited a significant reduction in plasma C-peptide compared to the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group (a decrease of 0.72 ± 0.11 ng/mL and 0.09 ± 0.11 ng/mL, respectively).  Subsequently, volunteers in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group also had an improved insulin sensitivity index (Figure 5C). The increase in insulin sensitivity was 3.8 times greater than that in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group and exceeded the baseline measurement by more than 60%. The benefits of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) were even more pronounced when we calculated the HOMA-IR index, which defines the extent of insulin resistance (Figure 5D). In the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group, we observed a nonsignificant reduction in HOMA-IR by 0.08 ± 0.08 units.",8d9690a5-37f1-46fc-bfbc-ee0f5f662b46
14,methods14," In contrast, every volunteer in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group showed a reduced HOMA-IR index, with an average decrease of 0.55 ± 0.08 units.  In the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group, we also observed a slight reduction in plasma high-density lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) levels after the 5-day dietary intervention. Both diets showed similar effects on plasma triglycerides (a reduction of up to 15%). However, no other significant changes in the plasma lipid profile were evident in any of the experimental groups (Table 2).  4. Discussion  In the present study, we demonstrate that 5 days of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) is a viable dietary strategy to reduce plasma levels of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O), which is a diet-derived cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk biomarker.",858f9c37-dab7-4d2a-ad7d-e60be30c6a05
15,methods15," Moreover, our data suggest that the reduction in trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) and improvement in the parameters that characterize glucose metabolism and the general metabolic state in healthy volunteers are attributed to intermittent energy restriction and the limitation of animal-derived protein consumption rather than increased vegetable intake.  The baseline characteristics of the volunteers in our study showed that they were slightly overweight and had plasma levels of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) that ranged from low values to extremely high values that are way above the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk threshold (up to 24 μmol/L), indicating the high individual variability of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) [40]. Because of this, fasting plasma glucose, as one of the main parameters characterizing metabolic health, was chosen as the key criterion for randomization in our study.",79fd7e3e-0f92-435f-8345-b195a8f371f3
16,methods16," Nevertheless, the adherence to fasting mimicking diet (FMD) resulted in a significant decrease in plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in 75% of the volunteers. At the endpoint, 22 out of 24 volunteers had plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels below the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk threshold in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group. Moreover, a recent study reported that the benefits of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) are more pronounced in individuals at risk than in those whose metabolic markers are within the normal range [41], which is in line with our findings. The same applied to trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels, as the most noticeable reduction in trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentrations was also observed in volunteers of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group with higher baseline trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) plasma concentrations.",374bd2f7-a9d9-435c-af2f-b4b91d658acb
17,methods17,"  In addition to the beneficial effects attributed to fasting mimicking diet (FMD), such as a decrease in fasting plasma glucose, reduction in C-peptide concentrations and overall improvement of metabolic health, the volunteers in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group also presented a slight reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, which may raise concerns about the development of atherosclerosis [42]. However, fasting mimicking diet (FMD) can be defined as a very low-calorie diet (very low calorie diet (VLCD)), as the caloric intake is ~800 kCal [43] for 4 subsequent days.",52a5a997-ca9c-4d4e-b25e-9e3a7c5ab969
18,methods18," Although previously reported studies applying very low calorie diet (VLCD) are very heterogeneous, there is some evidence that adherence to very low calorie diet (VLCD) can result in a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels; however, after the completion of very low calorie diet (VLCD), high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels tend to regain previous levels or even surpass them [44], which was also evident in the pilot data of our study (data not shown). Therefore, based on the cyclic and short-term regimen of fasting mimicking diet (FMD), we believe it should not be considered detrimental in terms of the reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and development of atherosclerosis.  Although the data from observational studies suggest that increased vegetable intake is also inversely associated with biomarkers of metabolic diseases [45,46], these findings are poorly supported by the evidence from interventional studies [47].",d5a0812c-6d33-42a7-8222-8e4cfb27ff68
19,methods19," Our results also indicate that a short-term increase in vegetable intake, as in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group, may not be sufficient to reduce plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels and provide noticeable benefits with respect to metabolic health, as we only observed a significant reduction in plasma triglyceride levels in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group. Moreover, volunteers in the volunteers served as a reference group (VEG) group were expected to proceed with their usual caloric intake and dietary habits in terms of meat consumption, which has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome [48,49] and T2D [50].",d6ad7d5f-db2d-4afa-8d4e-fb30e8600cdc
20,methods20," An alternative to fasting mimicking diet (FMD), in terms of limiting the consumption of products of animal origin, would be a vegan diet, which in a recent study displayed promising results and reduced plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels already a week after switching to a plant-based diet [51]. However, the trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) concentration returned to the previous level after the reintroduction of the usual diet [51], indicating that a vegan diet should be used as a permanent dietary regimen to sustain trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels within the normal range. This in turn could lead to lowered compliance with the diet [52], a problem previously reported with continuous caloric restriction as well [23,24,25]. fasting mimicking diet (FMD), on the other hand, due to its cyclic nature, is associated with high compliance [53], which we also observed in our study.",c2f275a9-c05a-49c4-8b51-6c46cef0a1c3
21,methods21," Overall, our previous and present observations emphasize the importance of reduced animal-derived protein consumption and limited calorie intake to achieve beneficial results, as in the case of fasting mimicking diet (FMD).  The main limitation of our study is the short-term nature of the designated dietary interventions (for only a 5-day period) imitating an acute change in diet. However, it has already been reported that such 5-day cycles of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) could also serve as a long-term strategy if repeated each month [28].",79aad427-9e89-4e67-a6c9-f657d29fcfd9
22,methods22," Since our pilot study indicates that, to some extent, the reduction in trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in plasma can also be observed a week after the completion of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) cycle (data not shown), further research should be conducted to assess the durability of the beneficial effects of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) on trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels in the plasma after returning to the usual diet. As the production of trimethylamine (TMA) is strictly microbiota-dependent, another limitation is that we were not able to collect samples to assess the impact of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) on gut microbiota. Some studies state that alterations in microbiota composition that favour trimethylamine (TMA)-producing bacteria are a possible mechanism by which plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels increase in T2D patients [54,55].",9314ff98-5e49-4203-8eaf-65b0df62a89b
23,methods23," However, recent research shows that some of the typical deviations observed in gut microbiota composition in patients with T2D [56,57] or atherosclerosis [58] can be restored by fasting mimicking diet (FMD) [59,60], thus possibly lowering trimethylamine (TMA) production and reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. Overall, these data suggest that the benefits of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) are not limited to only the exclusion of dietary sources of trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) [61,62,63], but could also be explained through the impact on gut microbiota composition. Moreover, it would also be of great interest to investigate the changes in the abundance of specific trimethylamine (TMA)-producing bacterial genera after following the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) cycle and upon reintroduction of the usual diet, as it has been shown that some of the beneficial effects on gut microbiota composition occur only after continuation of the usual diet [60].",699c29fa-66f1-4a96-911e-dd556dadbe98
24,methods24,"  To conclude, our results show that fasting mimicking diet (FMD), a vegetable-based, low-calorie variation of intermittent fasting with a strict exclusion of animal-derived protein sources, is an efficient strategy to reduce plasma trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels. Our results add a novel component to the interaction of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) and the metabolic state of a person, suggesting that trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) reduction should be considered one of the noteworthy benefits of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) with respect to improving metabolic health. However, further research is needed to assess the potential of compliance to fasting mimicking diet (FMD) and the effects on trimethylamine N oxide (trimethylamine (TMA)O) levels after the completion of several cycles of the diet, as well as upon the reintroduction of the regular diet.
