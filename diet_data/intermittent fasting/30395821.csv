11,methods11," Fasting Consistently Enhances Sorafenib-Induced Cell Death in Human Melanoma Cells It is widely manifest that short-term starvation (nutrient restriction) sensitizes or resensitizes many cancers to chemotherapeutic treatments [15,28], providing a potential powerful therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance of different tumor types, such as human skin melanoma [18]. Indeed, due to the urgent need of an effective and durable therapeutic regimen to treat patients affected by skin melanoma and to increase the overall patient survival rate, we decided to explore this opportunity. To this aim, a panel of human melanoma cell lines (BRAFWT and BRAFV600E) were submitted to EBSS (starvation, starved by using EBSS (STV)) or treated with sorafenib under normal (sorafenib (SOR), 10 μM) and starvation conditions (sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV)) for 24 h.",ae5cdb29-33d7-4464-9b97-f55362291968
12,methods12," The subsequent cell death induction was evaluated in all cell lines by measuring the percentage of sub-G1 populations of propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells, by flow cytometry. Data depicted in Figure 1A clearly show that most cell lines were resistant to starved by using EBSS (STV) or sorafenib (SOR) treatments individually while all of them were significantly sensitive to combined (sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV)) exposure. Then, we decided to use CHL-1 and SK Mel 28 cell lines (a BRAFWT and oncogenic BRAFV600E, respectively) as models in the next experiments. These cells were then treated with sorafenib (SOR) or cultured in EBSS (starved by using EBSS (STV)) alone or in combination (sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV)) and cell viability was evaluated at 6, 12, or 24 h post treatment.",fda9cdb9-f16a-4af6-bbef-94466aeb8450
13,methods13," Results confirmed the decrease of cell viability in both cell lines exposed to sorafenib (SOR) in combination with starved by using EBSS (STV) (Figure 1B) in a time-dependent manner, further sustaining the efficacy of combined nutrient restriction and chemotherapeutic treatment as potential therapeutic regimen design, compared to individual treatments.  3.2. Apoptosis Is Involved in Combined Sorafenib/Nutrient Restriction-Induced Cell Death To elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for melanoma cell death induction/execution under combined sorafenib (SOR)/starved by using EBSS (STV) treatment, we evaluated the presence/expression of key apoptotic markers such as PARP cleavage and Mcl-1 degradation, in both cell lines treated 2, 4, or 6 h with sorafenib (SOR) or starved by using EBSS (STV) alone or in combination by western blotting analysis.",fdf97dec-25c0-4188-aea8-d8bf117c36e3
14,methods14,"  Our results highlighted an early activation of caspases, key mediators of the apoptotic program and responsible for PARP cleavage, in both cell lines but restricted to the combined sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV) regimen (Figure 2A, upper panels). The expected lower sensitivity of SK Mel 28 cells compared to CHL-1 is also evident, due to the presence of oncogenic BRAFV600E conferring less sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli [8,29,30,31], evidenced by a less pronounced PARP cleavage efficiency at both 4 and 6 h post treatment compared to CHL-1. The involvement of the apoptotic pathway is also highlighted by the dramatic Mcl-1 downregulation in both cell lines exposed to sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV) (Figure 2A, middle/bottom panels), compared to control or each individual treatment (sorafenib (SOR) or starved by using EBSS (STV)), both known to affect Mcl-1 expression [32,33,34,35].",ea600135-0799-40ca-a426-a2422a179fd6
15,methods15," Finally, to further support the involvement of apoptosis, we exposed both cell lines to starved by using EBSS (STV) in combination with sorafenib (SOR) (sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV)), in the presence or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Z VAD FMK (ZVAD)) or necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (necrostatin 1 (NEC)), and cell viability was evaluated after 24 h. As shown in Figure 2B, the presence of Z VAD FMK (ZVAD), but not necrostatin-1, was able to protect both cell lines from sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV)-induced cell death, although a minor effect was observed in SK Mel 28, suggesting the involvement of a caspase-independent pathway activated by sorafenib in this cell line, as previously suggested by Lachaier [36]. Collectively these data indicate that apoptosis is involved in the cell death pathway stimulated by combined sorafenib/nutrient shortage in melanoma cells.  3.3.",d7791667-2714-4cdc-9969-1b21e5ba832b
16,methods16," Combined Nutrient Shortage and Sorafenib Induces Metabolic Stress Resulting in Cell Death Cell transformation and tumor development determine a well-known metabolic reprogramming with cancer cells preferring glycolysis to mitochondrial catabolism to produce ATP (Warburg effect) [1,2]. Therefore, we asked whether combined sorafenib and nutrient shortage-induced cell death was the result of metabolic stress. To this aim, we evaluated the mitochondrial activity in cells exposed to EBSS or sorafenib alone or in combination, by measuring alterations in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP)) by flow cytometry.",4ca82276-73fa-47b3-a166-5abcef221e2c
17,methods17," Although sorafenib (SOR) is known to target mitochondrial proteins (OXPHOS) [37,38], data in Figure 3A, show the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) was not (CHL-1) or slightly (SK Mel 28) altered in both cell lines in presence of sorafenib (SOR) or EBSS alone, while a consistent and early depolarization was observed in both cell lines concomitantly exposed for 2 h to sorafenib (SOR) + EBSS. These data possibly indicate that the 2 h treatment with sorafenib (SOR) we used in these experiments was not sufficient, per se, to consistently disrupt mitochondrial functions—that possibly cope the mild stress condition through the fission/fusion mechanism [39]—while concomitant treatment was efficient in inducing a consistent mitochondrial stress.",95446896-f5ba-44a2-a42d-7445b1d8a00a
18,methods18," These data were confirmed by a time course analysis (0, 5, and 30 min) of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) (TMRE-staining) in cells exposed to EBSS (starved by using EBSS (STV)), sorafenib (SOR), sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV), in which images were acquired by confocal microscope and analyzed by ImageJ software. Data indicate a clear mitochondrial depolarization in both cell lines concomitantly exposed to starved by using EBSS (STV) and sorafenib (SOR) but not in individual exposure (Figure 3B). However, the analysis of ROS (reactive oxygen species) production in the same experimental conditions revealed an increase in ROS generation in SK Mel 28 cells but not in CHL-1, possibly indicating a more efficient antioxidant system of the latter cell line compared to the former but, more importantly, that ROS production is not the main cell death mediator in sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV) exposed cells (Supplementary Figure S1).",358482da-5d3c-4e46-a0e8-cab60648ffbb
19,methods19," Then, we analyzed the signaling pathways typically activated under metabolic stress conditions. To this aim, cells exposed for 4 or 6 h to starved by using EBSS (STV), sorafenib (SOR), or starved by using EBSS (STV) + sorafenib (SOR) were lysed and total protein extracts were subjected to western blotting analysis. Data reported in Figure 4A (upper panels) show the previously described AMPK activation (P-AMPK) under EBSS (starved by using EBSS (STV)) [5] or sorafenib (SOR) [40] exposure, that was even more evident in cells concomitantly exposed to both treatments, to face the dramatic increased of AMP/ATP ratio resulting from latter experimental condition (sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV)). The energy stress condition under starved by using EBSS (STV) + sorafenib (SOR) is confirmed by concomitantly observed mTOR inhibition, evidenced by disappearance of its target P-p70S6K1 (Figure 4A, bottom panels), typical of persistent AMPK activation [41].",c53f41a6-d770-4d0a-83ba-92c06d3293c7
20,methods20," Cell’s response to metabolic stress was also evidenced by analyzing the expression of PGC1α, the key transcription factor strongly activated by conditions causing energy limitation [42]. Indeed, measuring the mRNA levels of this TF (transcriptional factor) revealed its upregulation in both cell lines under starved by using EBSS (STV) or sorafenib (SOR) treatment (at both 4 and 6 h) as expected, due to cell’s energy limitation and demand under both treatments, condition that was confirmed under both sorafenib (SOR) and starved by using EBSS (STV) exposure (Figure 4B). These results were further confirmed by measuring the cell viability of cells (CHL-1 and SK Mel 28) exposed to sorafenib (SOR) or starved by using EBSS (STV) alone or in combination (sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV)) in the presence or absence of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose).",1f728a3b-a819-483f-b1d8-c05713ddfc57
21,methods21," Data reported in Supplementary Figure S2 show indeed an enhanced cytotoxic effect of combined sorafenib (SOR) and starved by using EBSS (STV) in both cell lines cultivated in the presence of 2-DG, due to efficient inhibition of glycolysis, compared to limited inhibition due to low glucose content of EBSS (starved by using EBSS (STV)).  3.4. Autophagy Blockade Is Involved in the Signaling Pathway Stimulated by Combined Sorafenib and Nutrient Shortage Nutrient shortage and cellular stresses are typical inducers of autophagy, an intracellular catabolic process responsible for the removal of damaged or unwanted cellular structures/organelles and the production of energy to sustain cell survival [9,43]. However, although promptly induced under stress conditions, this process remains active for a limited time, due to a negative feedback loop responsible for early stabilization and subsequent degradation of key autophagic components [44,45].",2618f0ef-cdcc-49df-9fd7-e1bb94b1e11e
22,methods22," On the other hand, although highly debated, prolonged or deregulated autophagy might be responsible for or participate in cell death execution [46]. To evaluate the potential contribution of autophagy to the signaling pathway stimulated by combined sorafenib and nutrient shortage regimen in melanoma cells, both CHL-1 and SK Mel 28 were exposed to sorafenib (SOR) or starved by using EBSS (STV) alone or in combination, in the presence or absence of the downstream autophagic inhibitor chloroquine (CQ).  The protein levels of p62 and LC3-II were then evaluated by western blotting analysis, 6 h post treatment to detect the autophagic flux (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S3).",f93871e6-2118-48b6-9fc7-975a563b034e
23,methods23," These data show no significant decrease of p62 protein levels in any condition, suggesting that ubiquitinated proteins/organelles are not targeted by autophagy in these conditions, but a very slight increase of LC3-II in the sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV) condition was observed even without chloroquine, indicating a possible block in late-stage autophagy. Similar results were obtained by confocal analysis of autophagosome formation in both cell lines transduced with a vector encoding for a recombinant GFP-mCherry-LC3 protein and exposed to similar experimental condition reported above (Supplementary Figure S4). Cell viability was also evaluated in cells exposed to sorafenib (SOR) or starved by using EBSS (STV) individually or concomitantly (6 h), in the presence or absence of CQ, to block downstream autophagosome degradation.",59c4795f-3bdc-483e-bb63-a61c511fde17
24,methods24," Results indicate a slight enhanced toxicity of sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV) treatment in the presence of CQ, compared to the same treatment in the absence of CQ, possibly indicating a pro-survival activity of a very early autophagy induction (Figure 5B) that was augmented in longer treatments such as 12 h (Supplementary Figure S5). Next, we inhibited autophagy induction through atg5 silencing, transducing both cell lines with lentiviral particles carrying a specific Atg5 shRNA and using a scramble shRNA as a control. The downregulation of Atg5 was evaluated by western blotting analysis (Figure 5C), cells were exposed to starved by using EBSS (STV) or sorafenib (SOR) alone or in combination and cell viability was evaluated at 6 h post treatment. Results indicate no significant differences between cells able or not able to induce autophagy on exposure to sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV) in terms of cell viability, in both cell lines (Figure 5D).",32e7af28-67b1-4996-999b-272a4929be7e
25,methods25," Collectively, these data indicate that autophagy may be poorly involved in melanoma cells response to combined sorafenib and nutrient shortage treatment and with only a potential major impact on late-stage autophagy blockage.  3.5. Combined Sorafenib and Intermittent Fasting Regimen Reduces In Vivo Tumor Growth in an Autophagic-Independent Manner To verify the efficacy of combined sorafenib and nutrient shortage regimen on melanoma tumor growth in vivo, 2.5 × 106 SK Mel 28 cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of NOD/SCID mice.  The following development of subcutaneous tumors was monitored in the subsequent 25 days post injection.",e2343bf4-8be9-4839-b709-5f8314da9651
26,methods26," Then, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (6 animals each) and submitted to cycles of intermittent fasting alone (IF, DMSO) and in combination to sorafenib (sorafenib (SOR), 40 mg/kg) treatment (IF + sorafenib (SOR)) or with free access to food and water (cell lines untreated (CTR), DMSO) and treatment with sorafenib (sorafenib (SOR)), and tumor volume was recorded every two days, together with mouse weight (Supplementary Figure S6A), for an additional 14 days. Data reported in Figure 6A show a consistent and significant inhibition of tumor growth in mice subjected to combined sorafenib and intermittent fasting, compared to control, corroborating in vitro data. Next, mice were euthanized, and final tumor volume, together with tumor volume/body weight ratio (Supplementary Figure S6D), was certified confirming that intermittent fasting enhanced reduced median tumor growth (Figure 6B, right panel).",16634912-82fc-4cd1-a6a1-ce7b15c25300
27,methods27," The induction of autophagy was then evaluated in two tumor samples of each group by measuring the conversion of LC3 and degradation of p62, by western blotting analysis. Data reported in Figure 6B (right graphic) show the selection based on median tumor volume in each group of the two tumors (red dots) subjected to western blotting analysis. Figure 6B (left panel) demonstrates a slight accumulation of LC3-II after intermittent fasting or sorafenib alone but not after combined treatment (IF + sorafenib (SOR)), and densitometric analysis (lower graphs) although not statistically significant, corroborating in vitro data indicated a possible autophagy blockage in fasting-mediated enhanced sorafenib toxicity in melanoma cells (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S6).  4.",7ea2bc18-1521-47e8-91f5-050e18ce8d33
28,methods28," Discussion Although glucose addiction has been assumed as a cancer hallmark, with tumor cells using glycolysis to provide energy, it is now generally accepted that cancer cell development and growth relies on a dynamic and finely regulated balance between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to supply energy [47,48]. Intermittent fasting has been shown to modulate energy metabolism [49] and enhance tumor susceptibility to anticancer drugs, possibly boosting cellular oxidative phosphorylation to supply energy to sustain cancer cell survival [14,16,18,50]. Therefore, combining nutrient shortage with anticancer drugs targeting mitochondria might magnify metabolic stress conditions resulting in enhanced cell death. To explore this possibility, we used the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (BAY 43-9006; Nexavar) in combination with starvation, to kill human skin melanoma cells.",d2dd2615-4b82-4b94-8d2d-884d827ce21e
29,methods29," Although it is a known multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib also targets elements of the mitochondrial respiratory machinery thus interfering with mitochondrial metabolic functions [37,38]. It has been previously reported that sorafenib induces a caspase-dependent and -independent cell death process in several cancer cells, such as myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate cancer, pleural mesothelioma, and melanoma [51,52,53,54,55]. Moreover, it is also able to stimulate a newly discovered form of cell death, namely ferroptosis, in solid tumors [36,56]. We found no significative lethal effects in cells exposed to sorafenib alone, paralleled by no significant changes in MMP and ROS generation, indicating a not surprising melanoma resistance to drug-induced cell death.",532f0951-dc87-4880-8485-d13c145b9c6d
30,methods30," Therefore, although sorafenib targets mitochondria, it is possible to speculate that the mitochondrial quality control based on active fusion/fission processes might efficiently counteract sorafenib toxicity [39,57], at least at the time point and concentration we used (10 μM), pushing the tumor metabolism towards glycolysis. While, combined sorafenib and starvation significantly resulted in cell death induction associated with caspase activation, enhanced Mcl-1 degradation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, we also found that apoptosis is not the unique pathway contributing to combined sorafenib and nutrient shortage induced cell death since caspase inhibition blocked cell death only in part.",3d954eef-ff30-4442-83f2-462ae3d58972
31,methods31," Therefore, due to the ability of sorafenib to also stimulate the ferroptotic cell death [36,56] in some tumors together with the inefficacy of necrostatin-1—thus excluding the involvement of necroptosis—it is possible to speculate that ferroptosis might also be induced by sorafenib and enhanced by combined nutrient shortage, cooperating with apoptosis to kill melanoma cells.  On the other hand, nutrient shortage is a typical autophagic stimulus, which has at least two functions depending on time of induction and length. In fact, autophagy is promptly induced under nutrient deprivation to sustain cell survival by digesting damaged and/or expendable cellular structures to get energy. However, although this pro-survival pathway is irremediably blocked by caspase-mediated degradation of key autophagic proteins during apoptosis execution, in cells committed to die [45,58], it has also been reported that autophagy can contribute to or determine cell death [59].",299d321e-68d2-4ac7-8543-6d131d4c22f1
32,methods32," Therefore, we investigated the potential involvement of autophagy in the signaling pathway stimulated by combined sorafenib and starvation. Alone, both treatments stimulated autophagy, more proficient in BRAFWT melanoma cell line, possibly due to autophagy induction resistance in BRAFV600E melanoma in line with high basal autophagy [8]. On the other hand, when both treatments were combined, we observed a blockage in late-stage autophagy that contributed to cell death. Several evidences in literature suggest that autophagy blockage is beneficial to cancer treatment together with cytotoxic drugs on different tumor models [60,61,62]. The co-treatment of chloroquine and sorafenib potentiated cell death in glioblastoma and hepatocarcinoma cells due to autophagy inhibition [61,63].",97abab88-98e2-4e6f-ac9b-47f30cab0f9e
33,methods33," However, in our system, the treatment with the pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy chloroquine, was not able to achieve similar levels of cell death as sorafenib (SOR) + starved by using EBSS (STV), thus indicating other mechanisms are also responsible for starvation- and sorafenib-induced melanoma cell death.  Thus, we focused on potential involvement of metabolic stress as another cell death driver, which equilibrium could be regulated by the presence of sorafenib and nutrient shortage. In our hypothesis, while nutrient shortage could shift or move the metabolic equilibrium toward oxidative phosphorylation, the presence of sorafenib, targeting mitochondria, should move this equilibrium toward glycolysis. Therefore, under both individual stress conditions, the dynamic metabolic equilibrium can be pushed into one or the other direction, to the extent of the need, in order to ensure the correct energy level to support cell survival.",c5c898ec-e31b-4d4e-afe6-69931d93370b
34,methods34," However, under nutrient deprivation and sorafenib co-treatment, the concomitant inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation results in a persistent metabolic stress and energy deprivation, inducing cell death. This stress condition is even more exacerbated in presence of 2DG, already employed in the clinical management of cancer [64,65,66], which completely blocks the glycolytic pathway and also reverts the metabolic phenotype toward OXPHOS [67], further highlighting the role of glycolysis/OXPHOS balance in cancer cell energy supply, thus identifying the process as a potential and attractive therapeutic target.  These conclusions are also sustained by in vivo data showing reduced subcutaneous melanoma growth under intermittent fasting combined with sorafenib treatment, indicating this therapeutic strategy is potentially effective in clinical management of this malignancy.  5.",0a353de8-4f8c-4880-82d6-d1ef5de94c6c
35,methods35," Conclusions In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the restriction of nutrients by intermittent fasting potentiates the effects of sorafenib due to the modulation of cellular metabolism, suggesting that it is possible to harness the energy of cancer cells for the treatment of melanoma.
