0,abstract0," Immune‐based interventions are the most promising approach for new cancer treatments to achieve long‐term cancer‐free survival. However, the expansion of myeloid‐derived suppression cells (MDSCs) attenuates the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy. We recently showed that CD205+ granulocytic MDSCs (G‐MDSCs), but not T cells, are sensitive to glucose deficiency. Intermittent fasting (IF) may inhibit the growth of malignant cells by reducing serum glucose levels, but little is known regarding the influence of IF on MDSC expansion. Herein, we observed that IF selectively inhibited splenic accumulation of CD205+ G‐MDSCs in a 4T1 and 4T07 transplant murine breast cancer model. The efficiency of IF in suppressing tumor growth was comparable to that of docetaxel. Further examination revealed that CXCR4 expression was concentrated in CD205+ subsets of tumor‐induced G‐MDSCs.",bde72e8d-b2eb-4b8b-b936-354405180309
1,abstract1," Downregulation of CXCR4 correlated with a reduction in CD205+ G‐MDSC trafficking from bone marrow to the spleen under IF treatment. In addition, ex vivo culture assays showed that glucose deficiency and 2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose (2DG) treatment selectively induced massive death of splenic CD205+ G‐MDSCs. Interestingly, 2DG emulated the phenomena of IF selectively suppressing the accumulation of CD205+ G‐MDSCs in the spleen, upregulating cleaved caspase 3 in the tumor, downregulating Ki67 in the lung, and retarding the growth of transplanted 4T1 and 4T07 murine breast tumors. These findings suggest that IF inhibited cell trafficking through the downregulation of CXCR4 and induced apoptosis by altering glucose metabolism; this, suppressed the accumulation of tumor‐induced splenic CD205+ G‐MDSCs and in turn enhanced antitumor immunity.",c0b3e285-2667-4589-bd87-d3d579ab995c

3,abstract3,"2510 ==== Body pmc1 INTRODUCTION  Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature cells of myeloid origin (Gabrilovich & Nagaraj, 2009). MDSCs considerably expand during pathological situations, such as cancer, inflammation, and infection (Lv et al., 2019). Two subsets of tumor‐induced MDSCs have been identified based on morphology and cell surface expression of specific molecules. The granulocytic (G‐MDSC) [or polymorphonuclear (PMN‐MDSC)] subset has a CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow phenotype, and the monocytic (M‐MDSC) subset has a CD11b+Ly6G‐Ly6Chigh phenotype (Bronte et al., 2016). MDSCs mediate immunosuppression by perturbing lymphocyte homing, inducing T‐cell anergy, and controlling regulatory T‐cell differentiation. MDCSs have also been implicated in nonimmunological functions, such as promoting angiogenetic tumor cell invasion and metastasis (Priceman et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2004, 2008).",33465bd0-2e8b-4a70-9ae8-e9e105611135
4,abstract4," Accordingly, MDSCs are broadly viewed as a crucial factor attenuating the efficacy of some cancer immunotherapies, and thus, any interventive strategy that minimizes the negative influence of MDSCs may significantly improve outcomes for patients treated with immunotherapies (Ding et al., 2014; Garritson et al., 2020; Highfill et al., 2014).  The concept of dietary modulation to reduce cytotoxic effects and improve the response to cancer therapy is extremely attractive to many patients suffering intolerable side effects (de Groot et al., 2019; Tajan & Vousden, 2020). Compared with numerous chronic dietary interventions (Brandhorst & Longo, 2019), intermittent fasting (IF) (de Cabo & Mattson, 2019) induces a wide range of changes associated with potent antitumor effects that would be difficult to achieve with even a cocktail of anticancer drugs (de Groot et al., 2019; Lee & Longo, 2011; Nencioni et al., 2018).",9f5e8948-c480-4b7f-83ed-afe669f6cc9b
5,abstract5," Hallmarks of a systemic response to fasting in mammals include low levels of glucose, insulin, insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1), and leptin and high levels of glucagon, ketone bodies, and adiponectin (Brandhorst et al., 2015; Nencioni et al., 2018). At the molecular level, fasting reduces intracellular signaling cascades (including IGF1R–AKT–mTOR–S6K and cAMP–PKA signaling), increases autophagy, helps normal cells withstand stress, and promotes anticancer immunity (Nencioni et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2021). There is strong evidence that among the changes associated with fasting, the ones mediating the beneficial anticancer effects are the reduction in IGF‐1 and glucose levels (Lee & Longo, 2011; Lee et al., 2012).  Cancer cells are vulnerable to nutrient deprivation and dependent on specific metabolites (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2011). In most cell types, including malignant cells, IGF‐1 plays a crucial role in glucose uptake and metabolism (Aguirre et al., 2016).",b6ea54bf-1ec0-4d79-af57-46f3d024fd59
6,abstract6," Therefore, interventions targeting glucose metabolism are particularly promising (Turbitt et al., 2019). However, immune cells also rely on glycolysis to sustain their clonal expansion and function (Kedia‐Mehta & Finlay, 2019; Leone & Powell, 2020). As a result, it remains unclear whether glucose‐modulating therapies would support or hinder antitumor immunity. We recently showed that CD205+ G‐MDSCs, but not T cells, are sensitive to glucose deficiency (Fu et al., 2020). Therefore, we believe that fasting could potentially enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy if it suppressed the development of MDSCs. In the current study, we evaluated the development of G‐MDSC subpopulations under conditions of fasting and docetaxel treatment using a murine 4T1 and 4T07 transplant breast cancer model. We found that fasting decreased the accumulation of CD205+ G‐MDSCs in the spleens of the mice and did so by inhibiting cell trafficking and glucose metabolism.  2 ",9bb72c64-3c8f-4a67-89f3-eb9878c977c9

The mice were maintained on a specific pathogen‐free condition with 12 hr day/light cycles.  2.2 Cancer cell lines and tumor cell injection  The cancer cell culture was done as previously described (Fu et al., 2020). Briefly, the 4T1 and 4T07 murine breast cancer cell lines were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The cells were cultured in an RPMI1640‐based medium at 37°C and 5% CO2.  To obtain a transplanted tumor model, a total number of 2 × 105 4T1 or 4T07 breast cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland, respectively. The tumor volume was calculated as follows (Euhus et al., 1986): tumor volume (mm3) = (length 3 width 3 height)/2, where the height, length, and width are in millimeters.",04d6dc81-1d09-40a0-904f-efbe6c6b822d

To minimize animal pain, 20% of the bodyweight loss is allowed at most in fasted mice. During fasting treatment, mice were individually housed in a clean new cage to reduce cannibalism, coprophagy, and residual chow. 2‐Deoxy‐D‐glucose (2DG) and docetaxel were obtained from SIGMA (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). 15 μg/20 g 2DG and 15 mg/kg docetaxel were injected intraperitoneally into mice at indicated time points.  2.4 Ex vivo splenic cells culturation  The ex vivo splenic cell culture was done as previously described (Fu et al., 2020).

Briefly, tissues obtained from mice were paraffin‐embedded, fixed, and sectioned. The sections were soaked in 100% ethanol for 10 min twice and then hydrated sequentially through 95% ethanol, 80% ethanol, and distilled water. Before blocking the non‐specific binding via 5% bovine serum albumin, antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving in sodium citrate (pH 6.0). After that, primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. The secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP were then incubated for 1 hr and rinsed in PBS three times.

To maintain initial tumor‐size homogeneity, only mice with similar tumor volumes were used. As two cycles of fasting treatment (48‐hr fasting followed by a 8‐day refeeding) (Di Biase et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2012) have been shown to be effective in retarding the 4T1 breast tumor growth, the current experiments were also performed using the two cycles of fasting (Figure 1a). The 4T1 and 4T07 transplanted tumor volumes of fasted groups at the end of the first fasting cycles were significantly smaller than those of the control groups (Figure 1b). After the second fasting cycle, the volume of the 4T1 tumor was less than half of that in the control group (Figure 1c). Similar suppressive effects on tumor growth were observed in the 4T07 breast tumor model (Figure 1d and 1e).",a2b36b9a-284a-4d28-a11b-37bbcaa048e1

15,results2," Our results showed that, in healthy mouse spleens, <2% of all splenic CD45+ cells were CD11b+Ly6G+ cells, and approximately 20% of CD11b+Ly6G+ cells were CD205+ (Figure 2a and b). The transplanted 4T1 tumors and 4T07 tumors induced a 10‐fold increase in the accumulation of CD11b+Ly6G+ cells (Figure 2a and d). In addition, in 4T1 and 4T07 tumor‐bearing mice, the proportion of CD11b+Ly6G+CD205+ cells doubled compared with that in the healthy mice (Figure 2a). Furthermore, in 4T1 tumor‐bearing mice, fasting decreased the proportion of CD11b+Ly6G+CD205+ cells by at least half. Similar results were observed in the 4T07 tumor‐bearing mice (Figure 2a and d). In the 4T1 tumor‐bearing mice, docetaxel also suppressed the accumulation of CD11b+Ly6G+ cells; however, the difference is that fasting selectively suppressed the CD205+ subsets of CD11b+Ly6G+ cells. Moreover, the suppression effects on CD11b+Ly6G+CD205+ cells remained after the second fasting cycle (Figure 2c).",0ff5374b-60d7-451f-8b37-83e6972d354a

We observed that CD11b+Ly6G+CD205+ cells in the bone marrow and spleen showed similar chemokine receptor expression profiles. CD11b+Ly6G+CD205+ cells from the liver, spleen, and bone marrow specifically expressed CXCR4 (Figure 3a). In the bone marrow and spleen of 4T07 tumor‐bearing mice, CD11b+ Ly6G+ CD205+ cells also expressed high levels of CXCR4 (Figure 3b). In addition, the mean fluorescence intensity (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)) of CXCR4 in TLR2+ G‐MDSCs was comparable to that of the isotype control (Figure 3c).

24,discussion0,"  New interventions that can delay tumor progression or elevate antitumor effects of the immune system have drawn our attention in recent years. On the one hand, active ingredients extracted from natural foods might have potent antitumor efficacy and presented a rich source of structural information about biomolecules and their complexes (Martorell et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2019). On the other hand, the concept of dietary modulation to reduce cytotoxic effects and improve the response to cancer therapy represented by IF is extremely appealing to many patients (de Groot et al., 2019; Tajan & Vousden, 2020). A series of research reviewed by Lee and colleagues showed that the protective effect of fasting in mammals is mediated, in part, by a greater than 50% reduction in glucose and IGF‐1 levels (Lee & Longo, 2011). Furthermore, multiple cycles of fasting were as effective as chemotherapeutic agents in delaying the progression of different tumors (Lee et al., 2012).",1ff15ca5-0767-4677-80c1-75d36a891885
25,discussion1," This is consistent with our IF treatment results, yielding approximately a 50% reduction in 4T1 tumor weight, higher than that in 4T07 tumors (with approximately a 30% reduction, Figure 1b and c).  The expansion of G‐MDSCs is one of the main obstacles to improved antitumor immunity mediated by immune‐based interventions (Zhou et al., 2018). In the current study, we showed that IF treatment inhibited both 4T1 and 4T07 tumor progression and, at the same time, reduced total G‐MDSC accumulation (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Given that G‐MDSC can mediate immune suppression through both antigen‐specific T‐cell suppression, such as ROS production, and non‐specific mechanisms, such as the production of arginase 1, interleukin‐10, and cyclooxygenase‐2 (Bronte et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018), we believe that IF can also increase the antitumor effects of T cells in the cancer host.",56036233-6642-42af-863b-68b5f8f5d50e
26,discussion2," In fact, evidence shows that fasting‐mimicking diets can downregulate heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) expression in breast cancer cells, making them more susceptible to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, possibly by countering the immunosuppressive effect of regulatory T (Treg) cells (Di Biase et al., 2016; de Groot et al., 2019). In summary, those observations indicate that IF improved the tumor‐induced imbalance of antitumor immunity.  Furthermore, we revealed that fasting selectively suppressed the accumulation of CD205+ G‐MDSCs, which was different from the docetaxel treatment (Figure 2a). Evidence shows that docetaxel is not only a cytotoxic chemotherapy drug, but also has a chemo‐immunomodulating property as a therapeutic intervention for cancer (Fleming et al., 2018; Kodumudi et al., 2010). Docetaxel can selectively eliminate MDSCs and enhance antitumor immunity responses (Alizadeh et al., 2014; Millrud et al., 2018).",4140e393-be56-488e-88b6-3ea27275946c
27,discussion3," Those observations suggest that fasting modulated the tumor‐induced imbalance of antitumor immunity via a mechanism different from that of docetaxel. Moreover, chemokine receptors act as responders to chemoattractants to guide the migration of cells. Evidence shows that CXCR2 mediates G‐MDSC tumor trafficking in murine rhabdomyosarcoma models. CXCR2 deficiency prevents MDSC trafficking and enhances anti‐PD1 efficacy (Highfill et al., 2014). Conversely, CXCR2 and CXCR4 antagonistically regulate Gr‐1+SSC‐high neutrophil trafficking from murine bone marrow (Eash et al., 2010). Herein, we show that CXCR4 expression was concentrated in CD205+ G‐MDSCs, which are also characterized as Gr‐1+ SSC‐high (Fu et al., 2020). Downregulation of CXCR4 correlated with a reduction in CD205+ G‐MDSC trafficking from bone marrow to the spleen under IF treatment. Therefore, we suggest that the CXCR4 axis is a candidate mediator of fasting‐induced CD205+ G‐MDSC reduction in breast cancer hosts.",84dfe516-c06a-449f-8148-3fb8d3c3dd66
28,discussion4,"  Recently, we showed that transplanted 4T1 and 4T07 tumors induce CD205+ G‐MDSC expansion in the spleen and liver, but not EMT6 tumors (Fu et al., 2020). Interestingly, in the current study we observed that both 2DG and fasting retarded tumor growth of transplanted 4T1 and 4T07 cells (Figure 5a). However, 2DG combined with fasting does not suppress transplanted EMT6 tumor growth, despite 2DG inhibiting the viability of EMT6 cells in vitro (Aft et al., 2003; Rockwell & Schulz, 1984). Herein, we also revealed that 2DG treatment selectively induced massive death of splenic CD205+ G‐MDSCs (Figure 4b), and it could also emulate the phenomena of IF selectively suppressing the accumulation of CD205+ G‐MDSCs in the spleen (Figure 5b). We know that 4T1 tumor cells develop overt metastasis in vivo, while 4T07 and EMT6 tumor‐bearing mice fail to generate spontaneous metastatic tumors, despite their capacity to disseminate into secondary organs (Aslakson & Miller, 1992; Piranlioglu et al., 2019).",2362b7e3-a9f8-45b0-a17b-82a64e3d1a9b
29,discussion5," These observations suggest that CD205+ G‐MDSC might play an important role in cancer metastasis. Moreover, 2DG is a glucose molecule with the 2‐hydroxyl group replaced by hydrogen; thus, it cannot undergo further glycolysis. Therefore, 2DG is usually used as a glucose metabolism inhibitor in cancer research (Zhang et al., 2014). These results indicated that CD205+ G‐MDSC apoptosis was induced by IF, at least in part, through the regulation of glucose metabolism.  5 ",e027a582-e4ea-4cad-b840-71b1ec4fba81
30,conclusion0," In conclusion, this study revealed that IF has suppressive effects on a certain subpopulation of MDSC (CD205+ G‐MDSC) in 4T1 and 4T07 murine tumor models. We further demonstrated that IF suppressed splenic CD205+ G‐MDSC accumulation in a murine breast cancer model by attenuating cell trafficking and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, the results showed that IF inhibited cell trafficking through the downregulation of CXCR4 and induced apoptosis by altering glucose metabolism and in turn enhanced antitumor immunity. However, further studies to examine the antitumor activity of T cells are needed to assess the overall antitumor efficacy of IF.
