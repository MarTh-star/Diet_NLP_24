0,methods0," This systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) guidelines.  Literature search  A literature search was conducted to identify all existing articles, up to August 2021, that were related to the role of ketogenic diet on the gut microbiota in the context of neurodegeneration. The search terms “Ketogenic diet,” “High fat diet,” “Gut microbiome,” “Gut microbiota,” “Neurodegeneration” and other synonym terms to the previous terms were used in three electronic databases; PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and SCOPUS. A title, abstract and keyword search was performed using the search terms. The Boolean operator “AND” was used to link the terms together on all databases. Articles were first screened through their titles and abstracts before proceeding with full text screening of relevant articles.",069f7e21-c9df-4b65-9632-0c31704b361b
1,methods1,"  Literature selection  The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA)) guideline was employed during the literature selection . The following inclusion criteria were used during the selection process; (1) peer-reviewed original research articles investigating the interplay between ketogenic diet, gut microbiome/microbiota and neurodegeneration and (2) English articles with full text available. The exclusion criteria were; (1) non-original research articles labeled as editorials, symposiums, conference papers, commentaries, book chapters, case reports, systematic reviews, and reviews, (2) duplicated articles, (3) articles that were not in the English language, and (4) articles that did not investigate ketogenic diet effects on gut microbiota in the context of neurodegeneration.",78517202-2338-4f33-9f30-09908f888fcf
2,methods2,"  Quality appraisal  Different tools were employed to evaluate the quality of the selected relevant articles. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies by the Effective Public Health Practice Project (Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP)) (Project, 1998) was used to assess the clinical studies. The Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias (SYRCLE RoB tool) was used to assess the quality of the preclinical animal studies. The literature search, selection and quality analysis of the selected articles were performed by two independent researchers. ",2121cb77-c6a7-48fd-bdc0-687168d38230
3,results0," The initial literature search retrieved a total of 105 articles collectively from the three databases: 29 from PubMed, 20 from Ovid MEDLINE and 56 from SCOPUS. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 45 duplicated articles were removed. The remaining 60 articles were screened in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Figure 2). A total of 34 articles were then excluded as they were not original research articles, not available in full text or not in the English language. The remaining 26 original research articles were screened for relevancy to the aim of this systematic review; the effects of ketogenic diet on gut microbiota in the context of neurodegeneration/neurodegenerative disease. This led to the exclusion of 14 studies, which were found irrelevant to the aim of this review; not involving the interplay between ketogenic diet, neurodegeneration, and gut microbiota.",5bb22d21-1778-40e4-8992-cf05e79fc81b
4,results1," Thus, 12 studies were finally included in this systematic review for critical appraisal (Figure 2). These studies were further categorized into different neurodegenerative diseases and further subdivided into clinical (three articles) and preclinical animal studies (nine articles) within each category. Table 1 summarized the significant findings from these articles. Most of the preclinical studies adopted a ketogenic/high-fat diet in which 60% of calories originate from fat, 20% from protein and carbohydrate each.

14,discussion0," This systematic review highlighted that neurodegenerative diseases, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), AD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have an altered gut microbiota (gut dysbiosis), which predominantly consisted of increases in harmful phyla such as Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, as well as decreases in beneficial phyla like Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia). This review also elucidated the contrasting effects of ketogenic diet on the ND gut dysbiosis, which were dependent on the duration of the diet, the type of ND and possibly the influence of environmental factors.  Alteration in baseline gut microbiota in the disease model  There were no significant differences seen between the baseline alpha and beta diversity of the gut microbiota among the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) participants compared to cognitively normal participants (Nagpal et al., 2019, 2020).",32171130-9329-4b11-af57-766b66039fce
15,discussion1," On the other hand, MS participants depicted an overall significant decline in bacterial diversity by 36% and a bacterial mean total concentration by 24% compared to the healthy subject . In addition, the data collected by Swidsinski et al. connotated that patients with multiple sclerosis have an underlying colonic dysbiosis due to the diminished biodiversity and concentration of the essential bacterial groups, such as Faecalibacterirum prausnitzii (Fprau) . Fprau has been categorized as an anti-inflammatory microbe due to its capacity to generate butyrate (Bhargava and Mowry, 2014; Cantarel et al., 2015), which may play a central role in sustaining balance and maintaining the optimal ratio of regulatory T cells (T-reg) and T helper 17 cells (Th17) (Bhargava and Mowry, 2014; Cantarel et al., 2015). Hence, disruption to this balance may, in turn, induce inflammation (Bhargava and Mowry, 2014; Cantarel et al.",102b5beb-cebb-4d67-bbf4-4a8b0d924211
16,discussion2,", 2015), thereby possibly leading to aggravation of the neurodegeneration condition.  Taxonomical evaluation of the gut microbiota illuminated a predominance of phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes amongst patients with underlying ND. There was a significant elevation in the phyla Proteobacteria in fecal samples of subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in which the bacteria positively correlated with an AD-biomarker, Aß42/Aß40 ratio . Furthermore, family Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria) was also significantly elevated among Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects and correlated positively with AD-biomarker tau-p181 and tau p-181/ Aß42 ratio . In Alzheimer's disease, high abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was also associated with worsening of disease progression and decline in cognitive functioning.",e904913a-bc99-4c73-a78d-0e545dc587bd
17,discussion3," Notably, patients that harbored a high proportion of Proteobacteria had significantly low Mini Mental State Examination (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) .  Similarly, phyla Firmicutes was also elevated amongst those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at baseline and positively correlated with AD-biomarker tau p-181 . Patients with MS were found to have an elevated abundance trend of rRNA bacteria Cvir1414 (Clostridium viridae group), Ehal (Eubacterium hallii), Ecyl387 (Eubacterium cylindroides), Lab158 (Lactobacillus, Enterococcus sp.), and Rfla729 (Ruminococcus albus) upon colonic microbiota analysis via fluorescence in-site hybridization method (fluorescence in site hybridization method (FISH)), whereby all these bacterial groups belong to the phylum Firmicutes,  but these elevation was statistically insignificant.",c717e450-65fb-42ac-b42d-dd0ff16c22be
18,discussion4," In accordance with this, the Sprague Dawley rats also demonstrated a relatively higher abundance of order Clostridales which belongs to the phylum Firmicutes in the AD group .  Influence of ketogenic diet on microbiota  Two studies depicted that a ketogenic diet had resulted in a decrease in bacterial species diversity. For example, the rats within the AD-ketogenic diet group depicted a significant decline in bacterial species and a decrease in the Shannon Index (diversity) . The finding by Park et al. aligns with an earlier study by Ma et al. in which introduction of a ketogenic diet regime to healthy mice resulted in decreased species diversity . A similar pattern of enrichment of gut bacterial α-diversity was observed in mice treated with etomoxir, as well as in mice with genetically modified lower CPT1 activity known as SOD1Cpt1a/Cpt1a.",7dadca0e-d987-4245-9ea5-06c92d031741
19,discussion5," However, when these mice were assigned a 60% high fat diet, they showcased a drop in the α-diversity. Hence, it is believed that the downregulation of CPT1 in ND models by ketogenic diet may decrease the gut microbiota diversity, which may attenuate disease progression. Furthermore, a loss of α-diversity was also seen after the commencement of high-fat diet (Bruce-Keller et al., 2015; Higarza et al., 2019), where a diminished proportion of Firmicutes, and an augmented proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria was observed in the high-fat diet group . Additionally, a decrease in family Ruminococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, genus Lactobacillus, Clostridium cluster IV, Bifidobacterium, and an increase in family Peptostreptococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Bacteroidaceae, genus Bacteroides, Blautia, Rombustia, Bilophila, Escheria-Shigella were all identified in the high-fat diet group.",1024cb6c-ba1b-4fdf-8350-38a130d00291
20,discussion6,"  Similarly, another study showed an increase in phylum Bacteroidetes, genera Bacteroides, Dorea, Roseburia, Bilophila and a fall in size of phyla Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Tenericutes, genera Bifidobacterium, Odoribacter, Dehalobacterium, Turibacter, after high-fat diet (Bruce-Keller et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020). However, no specific pattern of changes in gut microbiota corresponding to the duration of dietary interventions were reported in these studies. In addition, differential abundance testing revealed a significant drop in harmful bacterial genera Rikenellaceae, Akkermansiaceae, Gastranaerophilales, and ⋎-proteobacteria in the group treated with etomoxir. Remarkably, class ⋎-proteobacteria and family Rikenellaceae have been widely held as pro-inflammatory bacteria, with the latter being linked to disruption of intestinal epithelial integrity and exacerbation of colonic inflammation via toll-like receptor (TLR)4 signaling pathway .",f2aa7cb3-5cb8-4c85-92fd-a06c3e1f2d28
21,discussion7,"  There is a pronounced increase in beneficial bacterial genera Lachnospiraceae and Odoribacter in the SOD1Cpt1a/Cpt1a mice group, as compared to their respective control counterparts. Odoribacter, has been known to generate lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) . This increase in beneficial bacterial composition was also seen with the genus Akkermansia, where after ketogenic diet intervention, the genus Akkermansia was elevated in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects  and even in healthy mice . It was also shown that in a high-fat diet animal model, the cognitive decay was halted, and spatial memory was improved by increasing the kynurenic acid production with the help of Akkermansia .",4b7bdd16-640a-43e9-b25b-01cdefc074b7
22,discussion8," Akkermansia was also reported to relieve systemic inflammation by decreasing the concentration of pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-10 and increasing anti-inflammatory markers . Furthermore, Akkenmansia was also depicted to restore gastrointestinal ecosystem by increasing the concentration of genus Bifidobacterium, neuroprotective bacteria, and decreasing the neurotoxic genera Bilophila and Bacteroidetes . In addition, Akkermansia may also produce beneficial SCFA, predominantly acetate and propionate, which was shown to be vital for gut and neuronal communication and homeostasis . Taken together, this evidence suggest that ketogenic diet not only reduced harmful bacterial composition, but also promoted the flourishment of beneficial bacterial species such as Akkermansia.",b3497127-9f4d-474b-9869-5240888ad50b
23,discussion9," In addition, harmful bacteria such as genus Lachnobacterium (of phylum Firmicutes) was found to be downregulated in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) after ketogenic diet intervention . Similarly, prominent down-regulation of pro-inflammatory bacteria genera Desulfovibrio and Turicibacter were also observed in mice on ketogenic diet . In fact, the concentration of Desulfovibrio was undetectable, whereas Turicibacter was two times lower in concentration compared to the control mice. Likewise, positive gut microbiota modulation was seen with ketogenic diet intervention, whereby the bacterial composition in patients with MS, was restored and almost coincided with the healthy control subjects after the diet .  Influence of ketogenic diet on clinical impairment  Mice that were on the ketogenic diet demonstrated enhanced abundance of the beneficial bacteria genus Lactobacilli by 3.2 times .",1c4108a2-559c-47c3-8338-0435c00affcd
24,discussion10," The increase in Lactobacilli and the decline in Desulfovibrio by ketogenic diet provided a shift within the internal gut environment to an anti-inflammatory state (Solas et al., 2017; Leigh and Morris, 2020). In support, the administration of probiotics containing Lactobacillus demonstrated restoration of cognitive impairment, whereas feeding of chow containing Desulfovibrio was shown to perpetuate the cognitive decline (Leigh and Morris, 2020), thus suggesting the positive impact of ketogenic diet on these two bacterial genera and possibly on neurodegeneration as well. The data collected by Swidsinski et al. connotated that patients with MS have an underlying colonic dysbiosis due to the diminished biodiversity and concentration of the essential bacterial groups, such as Faecalibacterirum prausnitzii (Fprau) . Fprau has been categorized as an anti-inflammatory microbe due to its capacity to generate butyrate (Bhargava and Mowry, 2014; Cantarel et al.",c31a724f-fde0-4347-9cf9-f2542cf7023d
25,discussion11,", 2015) which may play a central role in sustaining balance and maintaining the optimal ratio of regulatory T cells (T-reg) and T helper 17 cells (Th17). Hence, disruption to this balance may, in turn, induce inflammation, thereby possibly leading to aggravation of the neurodegeneration condition (Bhargava and Mowry, 2014; Cantarel et al., 2015).  Influence of ketogenic diet on others  Ketogenic diet has the ability to diminish the oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly MS, by increasing the levels of glutathione and catathione, which are enzymes that may exert antioxidant properties and counteract the increasing levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, respectively (Tobore, 2021). Mice on the ketogenic diet intervention have also demonstrated enhanced global cerebral perfusion, whereby regional blood flow to the ventromedial hypothalamus (ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)) was significantly increased by 11.82% .",96521ee1-d6d3-421b-a958-8c7e0f94762d
26,discussion12," In addition, Aβ clearance was also augmented in the mice under ketogenic diet . From a molecular perspective, the ketogenic diet reduced the production of mTOR protein by dampening its gene expression by 29.9%. Inhibition of mTOR protein expression may aid in delaying cognitive deterioration, as hyperactivation of this protein has been associated with memory impairment (Jahrling and Laberge, 2015). Besides that, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels were also found to be significantly boosted by 111.5% increase in the ketogenic diet mice . eNOS has been seen as a potent vasodilator, and hence increased circulating levels of eNOS by ketogenic diet may promote cerebral perfusion especially to the hypothalamus .",bb395791-c850-43d9-a4da-fb48b7810068
27,discussion13," A trial comprising of eNOS deficient mice models depicted pathological signs suggestive of the neurodegenerative process such as loss of white matter mass leading to cortical atrophy, along with decreased concentration of oligodendrocytes, resulting in lack of myelin sheaths . Hence, this elucidated the vital function of eNOS in maintaining a healthy central nervous system (CNS) environment. In addition, the expression of P-glycoprotein, an essential protein that may aid Aβ clearance from the brain, was also significantly elevated by 50% in ketogenic diet mice and its activity was promoted by 185.38% . The study by Park et al. further elucidated that integration of ketogenic diet as an intermittent diet schedule have proven to be more favorable, where a decline in Firmicutes and an augmentation in Akt phosphorylation were observed .",470fea02-2beb-4474-818a-8cb097710808
28,discussion14," Upstream signaling of the Akt molecule causes the activation of a cascade of molecular processes, which ultimately may lead to dampening of the AD pathogenesis, such as decreased Aβ deposition and formation of neurofibrillary tangles .  Negative aspect of ketogenic diet  Some studies have suggested that ketogenic diet exerts a negative effect on the gut microbiota. The conflicting results indicate that ketogenic diet as a therapy for gut dysbiosis in neurodegeneration may warrant further investigations, particularly in a clinical setting, where influences of environmental factors and inter-species interactions in the intestinal flora may govern the therapeutic effects of ketogenic diet.",183f75b8-64ad-45a0-9a76-be77a76d98f8
29,discussion15," A surge in abundance of family Streptococcaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae, which have been known for their pro-inflammatory and endotoxin-producing properties, as well as a decrease in the family Lachnospiraceae have been reported after a high-fat diet regime suggesting a inflammatory mediating effect of high-fat diet . Additionally, signs of gut dysbiosis have been observed in the AD rat group after ketogenic intervention, where there was an increase in the order Enterobacteriales (phylum Proteobacteria) . Furthermore, the ketogenic dietary pattern also resulted in a further increase in Enterobacteriaceae from baseline among Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects .",0050e6f8-6534-4de7-b1e9-ccf6fc9b1039
30,discussion16," Likewise, diminutions of the family Bifidobacteriacea (of phylum Actinobacteria) upon ketogenic diet in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients also depicted an unfavorable outcome of this diet pattern in the neurodegeneration context . In addition, within the MS population, a decline in levels of Akkermansia was observed after six months of ketogenic intervention , unlike the positive increase seen in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects .  Similarly, in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) transgenic animal model receiving high fat diet, worsening of neurological score, earlier onset of tremor, weaker grip strength, reduced overall activity level, and lesser right turns in Y-maze test were reported further exemplifying the diet's possible deleterious consequences in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) .",188d0953-c3e3-4b4d-a7e5-a815982071ed
31,discussion17," Correspondingly, from the pathological aspect, a heightened state of neuroinflammation was also shown by the rise in astrocyte reactivity marker, microglial marker (Cx3cr1 and Tmem119), TLR 2&4, and the decrease in ZO-1 and claudin 5, which are indicative of compromised neurovascular integrity, in subjects receiving the high fat diet (Bruce-Keller et al., 2015; Reilly et al., 2020; Zeltser et al., 2020). High fat diet was also found to render intestinal tight junction more permeable (lower jejunum and colonic occluding, increased DAO), thereby inducing a state of systemic inflammation, exemplified by increased colonic NOS, phosphorylation of p65 subunit of NFKD, plasma endotoxin and the pro-inflammatory IL-1β (Bruce-Keller et al., 2015; Trabjerg et al., 2021). In fact, Wu et al. also showed that a high-fat diet promoted memory decay and depression in mice, suggesting that a high-fat diet may indeed be more harmful than beneficial .",74a70c61-3d0c-49d1-b407-4ff24c3342b3
32,discussion18," Besides that, the contrasting behavioral and pathological effects seen between ketogenic diet intervention and high fat diet intervention may be related to the state of carbohydrate deprivation, which is higher in ketogenic diet than high fat diet. Thus, based on the evidence accumulated in this systematic review, ketogenic diet may be more beneficial toward neurodegenerative diseases than high fat diet, especially when integrated as an intermittent diet schedule, but the duration of the diet should be monitored closely. There is a substantial amount of evidence that proposes the positive molecular modulation of ketogenic diet in a healthy environment, but whether these positive modulations may persist in a neurodegeneration model may warrant further investigations.  Conclusion  Neurodegenerative disorders may lead the development of gut dysbiosis.",a7379caf-0b0a-4445-84c3-905fd4c65e3c
33,discussion19," This systematic review has highlighted the effects of ketogenic diet in modulating the interaction between the gut microbiota and the pathological pathway in neurodegenerative diseases. Ketogenic diet has shown to restore/promote beneficial microbes such as Akkermansia and confer neuroprotection by enhancing perfusion to the brain parenchyma, increasing amyloid-beta clearance and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines.
