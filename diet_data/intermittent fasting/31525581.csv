0,methods0,"A systematic search was undertaken in this scoping review to identify and map out relevant and pertinent articles related to the current study. Peer-reviewed and full-text English articles were gathered from a time frame as early as 1960 to May 2020 in electronic databases including: Scopus, Ovid, PubMed, and Web of Science (Web of Science (WOS)). The search terms used together with the Boolean operators AND and OR were as follows: “amyloid beta” OR “beta-amyloid” OR “β-amyloid” OR “amyloid-β” AND “intermittent fasting” OR “intermittent caloric restriction” OR “alternate day fasting” OR “modified alternate-day fasting” OR “time-restricted feeding” OR “Ramadan fast” OR “intermittent restrictive diet” AND “Alzheimer*”.",9e2b0c4f-0fb1-4d51-8f58-7bcaa40ac383
1,methods1," The inclusion criteria of this study were that (1) only primary articles were considered, (2) only experimental animal studies of AD were shortlisted, (3) the intervention applied to these animals was only those that underwent intermittent fasting, and (4) the effects of β-amyloid plaque or peptides were measured. In contrast, the exclusion criteria for the study were (1) studies that involved humans, (2) not specific to AD, (3) the intervention applied to the study was continuous calorie/energy restriction or starvation, and (4) the effects of β-amyloid plaque or peptides were not measured. All titles and abstracts from the search results were initially screened and independently critiqued by all authors. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the articles were shortlisted for eligibility upon reaching a consensus by all authors.  3. Results The literature search identified a total of 29 articles from these databases.",e99268bf-5bb5-4cf8-aa45-d7de9126c6a5
2,methods2," Sixteen articles were found to be duplicates (based on the title and abstract) and were subsequently removed. The 13 remaining articles were then screened and analyzed with much depth for eligibility. Five articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the current review. A summary of the data extracted from the five articles can be found in Table 1.  Several different transgenic mice models were used in the selected review. One study incorporated 5xFAD mice that carry five familial AD mutations: Swedish (K670N), M671L), Florida (1716V), and London (V7171) mutations in human amyloid precursor protein (amyloid precursor protein (APP)695) and two mutations (M146L and L286V) in the human presenilin 1 protein [38].",59075a70-5066-47b5-9beb-cf86b01d1746
3,methods3," One study employed a triple transgenic AD mice model with one harboring Swedish double mutation, beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaamyloid precursor protein (APP)Swe), presenilin-1 (PS1M146V), and human tauP301L [42], while the other was an amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-in mice (amyloid precursor protein (APP)NL-G-F) that developed several features of AD [39]. Furthermore, one other study employed a double transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP)-PS1 mouse [41]. All of these mice were designed to increase the deposition rate of β-amyloid in the brain with some as early as two months old [38]. Interestingly, only one study was found to employ ovariectomized female rats instead, and they were infused with β-amyloid peptides into their hippocampus [40]. The age of the mice and rats at the start of the intervention varied from study to study.",860c6874-cc04-44cd-a53e-acf4bae3d4c8
4,methods4," Three studies started the intervention as early as two to three months old [38,40,42], while the other at five months old [41], and lastly at 12 months old [39].  Three studies underwent the alternate day fasting (ADF) method where food was deprived for a period of 24 h [38,41,42], while the remaining two studies employed a time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol of 3 h per day [40] and 2 days per week of food deprivation [39]. The intervention duration was also found to be wide-ranging across studies. For the alternate day fasting (ADF) protocol, the shortest duration was 4 months [38], followed by 5 months [41], and the longest at 14 months [42]. The time-restricted protocol of 3 h per day started at the beginning of the dark cycle (7 to 10 PM), which corresponds to the morning for humans for a period of 2 months [40], while the 2 days per week food restriction was conducted for 9 months [39].",a636f9c6-4be4-45f8-86c6-e4409b72a07d
5,methods5,"  The majority of the studies reported in this review utilized immunohistochemical (immunohistochemical (IHC)) analyses for the detection of β-amyloid plaque formation [38,39,40,41]. However, they differed in terms of the staining or primary antibodies used to detect β-amyloid. At least one used thioflavin-s staining [38], while others used monoclonal or polyclonal aβ-42 primary antibodies [39,41]. Moreover, one study did not specify in detail the types of primary antibody used for immunohistochemical (IHC) [40]. Additionally, two studies employed ELISA with either aβ-42 alone or with aβ-40 [38,42].  The effect of intermittent fasting on the changes of β-amyloid deposition in the hippocampus and/or other cortical areas of the brain was found to be conflicted.",ca4c8bcf-6998-4ca5-9ca8-6e4bd4dcbdb8
6,methods6," β-amyloid levels in the hippocampus of the triple transgenic (3xTgAD) AD mice undergoing alternate day fasting (ADF) were found to be not significantly different (Aβ-42 and Aβ-40) from the levels found in littermates that were fed ad libitum [42]. The observation was also true as demonstrated in 5xFAD mice that underwent a similar protocol [38]. Thioflavin-S positive plaque levels in both 5xFAD fed ad libitum and 5xFAD-alternate day fasting (ADF) were found to be comparable and non-significantly different [38]. Subsequent measurement of the individual β-amyloid peptides via ELISA in both of these brain areas demonstrated no significant changes as well [38]. Interestingly, one time restricted feeding (TRF) study on a knock-in mouse model (amyloid precursor protein (APP)NL-G-F) saw a non-significant trend towards lower amounts of β-amyloid accumulation in amyloid precursor protein (APP)NL-G-F mice on the protocol as compared to amyloid precursor protein (APP)NL-G-F fed ad libitum [39].",a38370f0-bc1c-4b0f-98fc-9d4100fca4c0
7,methods7," In contrast, only in a double transgenic mouse model of AD (amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1) were significant differences of β-amyloid levels observed in the cortical areas between mice fed ad libitum and alternate day fasting (ADF) [41]. The same result was also demonstrated in non-transgenic ovariectomized rats that underwent time restricted feeding (TRF) [40]. These rats exhibited less β-amyloid deposition in the hippocampus as compared to those that were fed ad libitum [40].  Moreover, a number of different cognitive and/or behavioral tests were also employed in these studies to gauge the effects of intermittent fasting on AD mouse/rat models. The Morris water maze test was employed with most if not all of the animal models that underwent intermittent fasting to demonstrate improved goal latency [39,40,41,42], as well as in the probe trial scores of the swimming task [40,41,42], in comparison to ad libitum fed littermates.",ec8b3bdd-e13c-48cd-b3a7-74ff63088823
8,methods8," Furthermore, the knock-in AD mouse model [39] that underwent alternate day fasting (ADF) showed increased performance in the Y-maze test as compared to its counterparts that were fed ad libitum. Like the Morris water maze test, the knock-in AD mice with intermittent fasting had lower goal latency scores in their 2-day water maze test as opposed to the non-fasted ad libitum littermates [39]. Additionally, ovariectomized AD rats that underwent time restricted feeding (TRF) showed reduced latency period in the passive avoidance test in contrast to those that were fed ad libitum [40]. In contrast, 5xFAD mice that underwent alternate day fasting (ADF) demonstrated increased anxiety-like behavior following the light/dark box test and deteriorating short term memory in the novel object location (novel object location (NOL)) experiment as compared to their non-fasted, ad libitum fed 5xFAD mice [38].",802c28f6-d31d-44cc-8c29-38c0c629f0f4
9,methods9," Additionally, while the fasted 5xFAD mice demonstrated no signs of mobility deficits in the open field test [38], aged triple transgenic mice-AD mice with alternate day fasting (ADF) had improved distance traveled and ambulatory count scores as compared to transgenic mice that were fed ad libitum [42].  4. Discussion This scoping review suggests that evidence of restriction in the frequency of feeding and reduction in β-amyloid levels is still in its infancy. Unlike studies that employed continuous calorie restriction in a transgenic mouse model of AD where the results demonstrated a significant reduction in β-amyloid burden [43,44,45,46], only two studies reviewed here [40,41] advocated a positive relationship between intermittent fasting and reduction in plaque deposition in the brain. The remaining three studies showed no significant changes or reductions in β-amyloid plaque [38,39,42].",edff2f5e-baba-46b0-a2e1-539434fe72e2
10,methods10,"  This led us to hypothesize that genetic background and/or transgene expressions in mice played a strong influence on the final molecular outcome following the intervention. A recent study has shown that plaque burdens and distribution among transgenic lines are highly heterogeneous, and changes across their lifespan are line- and region-dependent [47]. The study showed that the dense core plaque burdens were varied by more than an order of magnitude between the lines [47]. The study further reported that the median cortical plaque burden in 15-month-old 5xFAD mice was 4.5 times that of 21-month old Tg2576 and 15-month old rTg9191 mice [47]. Taking this into consideration, we feel that the intervention fails to produce positive results in these mice owing to the burden that may be too overwhelming as compared to those studies that employed only a double transgenic mouse model and rats that were directly infused with β-amyloid peptides.",ffe5f3fb-08ed-4b56-8ca9-d5ee6c620e23
11,methods11," This goes to show that the intervention may have a much higher success rate in sporadic AD cases in humans as humans have far fewer plaque build-ups and smaller size as compared to familial, animal models of AD [47,48,49].  In addition, one startling finding that we further noted was that employing intermittent fasting feeding at an early or prodromal stage in mice with multiple transgenes like 5xFAD has resulted in an exacerbated neuroinflammatory activity in the cortex of these mice [38]. A 2-fold increase in Iba1-positive microglial cells coupled with elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, were detected in the 5xFAD in comparison to controls fed ad libitum [38]. This observation was further accompanied by a trend in increased anxiety-like behaviors [38]. This negative effect was also demonstrated in a poly(inosinic:cytidylic)(I:C) model of inflammation [50].",810eea20-cd03-4a0b-86e4-a9f85fbc8820
12,methods12," alternate day fasting (ADF) was found to amplify the levels of circulating cytokines and aggravated sickness behavior in response to Poly(I:C) [50]. Moreover, the same dietary protocol failed to demonstrate protective effects against colitis and related behavioral disorders in contrast to time restricted feeding (TRF) and intermittent energy restriction (intermittent energy restriction (IER)) [51]. This could mean that different dietary protocols may have a range of different effects, with some potentially aggravating pre-existing pathology such as the case of alternate day fasting (ADF) as applied to 5xFAD mice.  Furthermore, it is however surprising to note that while the outcome for changes in β-amyloid levels as a result of the intervention is mixed in general, cognitive dysfunction was found to be ameliorated in these animals.",11443ece-3485-4d63-94c5-8f382f5666ab
13,methods13," Except for one study involving 5xFAD mice [38], intermittent fasting protected these animals by improving defunct spatial learning and memory as compared to those that were fed ad libitum [39,40,41,42]. Transgenic and knock-in mice, as well as the β-amyloid-infused AD-rats that underwent intermittent fasting, showed cognitive improvements in the Y-maze test, a 2-day water maze test, passive avoidance test, and Morris water maze test in comparison to either wild-type or transgenic/knock-in/infused-AD animals fed ad libitum [39,40,41,42]. The current understanding of the correlation between plaque load and cognitive impairment in humans, on the whole, has been rather conflicted. Recent findings have shown that plaque loads do not correlate well with cognitive impairment in humans with AD [52,53]. Further studies have demonstrated extensive β-amyloid pathology in cognitively normal aged individuals [54,55].",2fedcda6-dadd-4c34-9e28-df584713f3ce
14,methods14," Fresh evidence has suggested that cognitive outcomes are much closely related to tau proteins than they are to β-amyloid plaques [56]. This provides a plausible explanation as to how some humans can tolerate a high β-amyloid load without cognitive impairment [42]. Though this is the case, we fail to see a reduction in the levels of tau proteins in the 3xtgAD mice model undergoing alternate day fasting (ADF) as compared to controls fed ad libitum that could explain the improved cognitive dysfunctions in this group [42]. A similar observation can be said for in the β-amyloid-infused AD rats that underwent intermittent fasting [40]. This begs the question of whether or not intermittent fasting is protecting these animals via a different and unelucidated mechanistic pathway foreign from the actions or presence of tau and/or β-amyloid?  To date, no study has explored the potentiality of intermittent fasting in human AD subjects.",3eb08509-ed32-4325-b708-7df3ebaa7dd3
15,methods15," However, its application in one relatable study of aged individuals has resulted in positive outcomes. Elderly people with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) who regularly practice intermittent fasting showed a significant increase in cognitive scores in a wide range of psychological domains in contrast to irregular and nonregular fasters [57]. These people showed a significant increase in the antioxidant superoxide dismutase levels with significantly lower DNA damage events [57]. They were also found to have reduced malondialdehyde and c-reactive protein levels as compared to levels at baseline [57]. These subjects interestingly presented with a reversion towards healthy cognitive states upon 36 months period follow up [57]. This provides preliminary evidence for potential neuroprotective and neurocognitive effects of intermittent fasting in people with AD.",f1c78311-2efc-49d9-a9ef-4e5217ef3653
16,methods16,"  Intermittent fasting confers neuroprotective effects through increased neurotrophic factor signaling and activation of autophagy [58,59,60,61]. The current review suggests that intermittent fasting restored Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) levels which is crucial for AQP4-dependent glial and lymphatic pathway systems that are key in the removal of soluble β-amyloid from the interstitium [41]. Moreover, the study by Liu and colleagues [39] reported hippocampal neuronal network adaptations mediated by SIRT-3 in amyloid precursor protein (APP)NL-G-F knock-in mice that underwent intermittent fasting that is associated with reduced anxiety-like behaviors and elevated hippocampal-dependent memory, independent of β-amyloid plaque deposition. These taken together provide plausible evidence, though limited, that intermittent fasting may preserve synaptic functions even in the presence of β-amyloid.  Our finding has to be taken with great caution.",df4dca48-6aa8-4309-8c5e-64ad92ae3732
17,methods17," The limitation of this review was that it only covered five studies related to intermittent fasting and β-amyloid deposition. The study design in these studies was found to be heterogeneous in nature whereby the dietary protocols, types of experimental animal used, age at onset, and the duration of the study are wide-ranging. This makes it difficult for us to interpret with confidence and definitively on the effectiveness of intermittent fasting as a treatment/preventative tool to influence or reduce β-amyloid levels in AD.  Bear in mind again that the animal models reported here are mostly transgenic in nature. These animals possess a combination of multicopy transgenes, amyloid precursor protein (amyloid precursor protein (APP)), and mutations of Presenilin 1/2 (PS1/2) and/or tau, that seek to express high levels of β-amyloid.",6c9ddb47-0551-48a9-9074-35f0b0836ac2
18,methods18," The 5xFAD model, for example, is a complex model created from combining three amyloid precursor protein (APP) and two PS1 mutations that cause rapid onset of β-amyloid plaque accumulation as early as two months of age. Similarly, the knock-in mouse model as reported here, while devoid of amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpression like 5xFAD, produces progressive plaque development starting at 2 months old and becomes saturated at 7 months of age. In contrast, occasional β-amyloid can be seen as early as 6 months old for double and triple mice models and progresses further with age. These taken together make it difficult to collectively and conclusively confirm the success or failure of the treatment or intervention if it is only measured at one single time point (i.e., at the end of the intervention period).",0705d28b-ba1e-4103-940b-95306c299c0a
19,methods19," Intermittent fasting, in this case, may have been targeting varying pathways depending on when we measured the β-amyloid as well as the genetic background of the mice we are testing against. This could partially explain why the significance of the findings reported in this review was not consistent.  A longitudinal approach looking into the levels of β-amyloid at multiple time points would help in overcoming this problem. By studying the temporal/or age-related changes occurring at the molecular level, as well as its corresponding behavioral and/or cognitive changes at 2, 4, or 6 months of the fasting period, for example, would assist greatly in gauging how well intermittent fasting is exerting its effect on AD pathology. Furthermore, applying the metabolomics platform during these time points would provide invaluable information on crucial biomarkers that may be key in elucidating the neuroprotective mechanisms of intermittent fasting.",623ef8f2-1b15-4698-9c35-2b0259a24333
20,methods20," Additionally, this study should comprise of several different forms of interventions (alternate day fasting (ADF) or time restricted feeding (TRF)) tested in tandem to observe the best protocol and circumstances that could make it suitable without posing a threat to the wellbeing of the animal or exacerbating pre-existing pathology. Moreover, fixing the duration of the fasting periods would be highly ideal in this case given the potential usage of this intervention in multiple different models.  Furthermore, as the different studies reported here provided different methods of analyzing the levels of β-amyloid (i.e., immunohistochemical (IHC) or ELISA), this makes it slightly problematic to properly compare the data. Future studies should present their immunohistochemical (IHC) findings using percentages of the area that occupied β-amyloid reactivity rather than using the total number or the average number of plaques present.",59178a5a-5669-424f-aba2-563b201911a7
21,methods21," Quantification methods of these immunoreactivity readings have to be standardized using a single machine or software to ensure intra/inter-laboratory reproducibility. This also extends to how the sections were collected and prepared. Moreover, for ELISA, data presentation using a fixed scale is rather crucial. These are needed to allow for consistency of future study designs as well as to allow direct comparison across different studies.  Additionally, the effect of intermittent fasting on neurofibrillary tangle expression should also be further explored. Other than the works reported in the current review, there is no other study on the effects of intermittent fasting on tau pathology. To date, there is only one study that measured the effect of the ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (a known by-product of fasting), on tau tangles.",070727f7-cb3f-4057-b1cd-52c6c3eeaf11
22,methods22," The study demonstrated a reduction in high-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD))-induced aggregates of tau tangles in apolipoproteinE4 (APOE4)-deficient mice following its administration [62]. This provides promising proof that the application of intermittent fasting is highly relevant when using an appropriate model.  Moreover, as these mice mimic the rare genetic form that develops either plaque or in a combination with neurofibrillary tau tangles, the use of the sporadic AD model is highly warranted for future studies. One recent model that was made possible by intra-cerebroventricular or intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (streptozotocin (STZ)), a glucosamine-nitrosourea, in the brain of rodents has been proposed as a representative model of sporadic AD [63]. The administration of streptozotocin (STZ) has resulted in an insulin-resistant brain state that shares common features of sporadic AD in humans.",6c08b766-e28b-45c7-9daf-fb1f70cb7211
23,methods23," This includes spatial learning deficit, memory impairment, increased cerebral aggregated β-amyloid fragments and β-amyloid deposits, total tau proteins, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, cholinergic deficits, and glucose hypometabolism [63]. To date, the application of intermittent fasting on this model was only directed towards modulation of the diabetic syndrome, and not neurodegeneration [64]. This provides a fresh avenue to study intermittent fasting in the context of Alzheimer’s disease in a much relevant setting.  Additionally, studying the effects of intermittent fasting on neuroinflammation could also increase our understanding of how dietary intervention can influence AD pathology. While the direct study of intermittent fasting, AD, and neuroinflammation is lacking, there are previous relatable studies that could provide preliminary evidence that can be considered for future undertakings.",e961d6df-71d5-438b-a2ab-bf0311fffe61
24,methods24," One such study has reported that intermittent fasting pretreatment provided sustained neuroprotection against inflammation and lowers cognitive impairments in a rat model of vascular dementia [65]. Additionally, another study has demonstrated the amelioration of cognitive deficits in a rat model of sepsis [66]. The areas of future research could be extended by looking into the inflammatory effects caused by activated microglia owing to the presence of β-amyloid and/or tau and how intermittent fasting can improve the condition in a sporadic model of AD.  Moreover, considering the high prevalence of women with AD, it is best to invest in future studies on the effect of sex differences in AD and its relation to intermittent fasting. There is only one study reported that directly compared the differences. However, the comparison was limited to only cognitive changes following intermittent fasting, and not β-amyloid and/or tau pathology.",ef4bef84-fd8d-43f7-91df-a9721d3e90ac
25,methods25," The study exhibited poor or longer escape latency and path lengths traversed in the Morris water maze test for female 3xtg-AD ad libitum fed mice in comparison to male 3xtg-AD [42]. Additionally, both male and female 3xtg-AD mice demonstrated improved performance in the hidden platform test following intermittent fasting [42]. The application of intermittent fasting on sex differences is pertinent to allow for targeted intervention to be introduced prior to the clinical manifestations of AD in both males and females.  Furthermore, studies on the effect of dietary protocols on β-amyloid protein clearance and degradation pathway have to be lengthened since sporadic AD is believed to arise due to the failure of β-amyloid clearance [67]. Besides, this work can further be extended by looking into the outcome of intermittent fasting on the gut microbiome and how it may synergistically improve neurodegeneration.",96fec05f-155b-4548-9fe8-ec2afd9d7d5b
26,methods26," A recent study has demonstrated that intermittent fasting ameliorated diabetes-induced cognitive impairment and is mediated by gut microbiota [68]. Lastly, studies on the practicability of intermittent fasting versus caloric restriction in the current context are still limited. This warrants for further investigation to be conducted in animals and humans looking at the differentially activated pathways from these two lifestyle interventions.  5. Conclusions This scoping review summarizes the current knowledge and understanding of intermittent fasting and its relation with β-amyloid deposition in experimental animal models of AD. Findings gained from this study proved to be difficult to be generalized given the limited number of studies reviewed and the heterogeneity of the study designs.",5b7150dc-70f7-4759-bbfa-03ff3cd37634
27,methods27," However, there appears to be a relationship between intermittent fasting and β-amyloid deposition which warrants additional work in the area and provides a window of opportunity for how the intervention could potentially work in humans. A future longitudinal study looking into several different intermittent fasting protocols in tandem, on a specific animal model coupled with metabolomics analyses, could provide novel mechanistic insights as to how the two are connected. Further work on tau pathology and neuroinflammation have to be considered. The success of future studies could demonstrate intermittent fasting as a cheap, viable, and potent preventative tool against AD.
