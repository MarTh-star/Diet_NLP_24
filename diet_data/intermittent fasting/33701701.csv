0,background0," Psoriasis is a complex disease associated with multiple comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome and leaky gut syndrome. Dietary lifestyle interventions have been reported to affect the disease in terms of lesional severity. It remains unclear how diets affect these comorbidities and the general health in psoriasis patients. Modified intermittent fasting (Modified intermittent fasting (MIF)) on 2 nonconsecutive days has shown beneficial effects on metabolic parameters. A significant advantage of Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) over the currently investigated dietary changes is its feasibility.  Objective  Here, we aim to study the effects of Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) on skin, gut, and metabolic health in psoriasis patients. ",e0e169c7-2cf8-40a8-bd51-1464af784203
1,methods0, Research Hypothesis  We aim to investigate the impact of a Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) diet in patients affected by mild psoriasis on skin and gut health based on various markers. The main hypothesis is that a 5:2 diet over the course of 12 weeks will improve skin lesions and gut health biomarkers in comparison to a standard diet.  Primary Objective  The primary objective of this study is to compare Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) with a standard diet in terms of the proportion of patients obtaining an improvement in absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline during or at the end of the 12-week postintervention period to prove the superiority of Modified intermittent fasting (MIF).,2a8427c1-a9c6-494d-93a5-cbe4679f7560
2,methods1,"  Secondary Objectives  The secondary objective of this study is to compare Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) with a standard diet during or at the end of the 12-week postintervention period in the following aspects: differences in total body fat, weight, BMI, and waist circumference during and after intervention to baseline; differences in inflammation markers in serum and skin during and after intervention to baseline; differences in metabolic markers in serum and skin during and after intervention to baseline; differences in permeability markers in serum, skin, gut, and feces during and after intervention to baseline; correlation to dietary intake and disease severity; and score of participants’ rating of satisfaction with the intervention.  Finally, the number of participants who complete the study or single intervention window successfully will also be assessed to give us insights into the feasibility of the diet.",fee72611-87c9-40c5-a624-263e6ab30403
3,methods2,"  Study Design  We will use an open randomized controlled cross-over clinical trial to test the effects of Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) on the gut-skin axis in 24 adults with psoriasis. The total study duration will be 34 weeks: 2 moments will be included as baseline prior to randomization (week 0 and 2). Randomization will be performed with the REDCap (Vanderbilt University) randomization module upon inclusion. Postrandomization, patients will be assigned to either the intervention or control arm. This study will use a cross-over design, and patients will switch arms at week 14 (Figure 1). Evaluations will include clinical, biochemical, and patient-reported outcomes. Intermediate time points will be included at weeks 8 and 20. Each participant will be in the study for a total of 26 weeks, with a single follow-up at week 34 after completion of the second arm. The entire trial will run for 12 months with a recruitment period of 3 months.",d1dc4a9f-f022-4a06-b993-afc558f83fe2

8,methods7," Baseline measurements will consist of 2 different time points: inclusion (week 0) and randomization (week 2), which will be averaged for analysis. Upon randomization, participants will be assigned to either the control or intervention arm in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention consists of a dietary intervention based on the 5:2 fasting diet. Participants will perform Modified intermittent fasting (MIF), for which they will be asked to consume a total of 500 kcal in a window of 6 hours or less from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM, twice per week on 2 nonconsecutive days. Participants will receive a leaflet with examples of what 500 kcal constitutes. This intervention will last for 12 weeks, starting from randomization. The control arm resembles the baseline period, in which participants can eat without restriction for 12 weeks. A digital food diary will be completed using the MyFitnessPal app, and participants will be asked to use the TARGID tag [45] present in the app’s database.",f5307dde-eaa5-4b56-ba55-a0b0200f892c
9,methods8," Participants are expected to record their dietary and exercise habits twice a week through the MyFitnessPal app (on the fasting days in the intervention arm). The Food Frequency Questionnaire will be used during all visits to assess and record any dietary changes. Clinical evaluation will be performed during PsoPlus consultations held at the Department of Dermatology at the Ghent University Hospital by the treating dermatologist and specialized nurse. Questionnaires regarding QoL will be completed in the waiting room prior to the consultation, while questionnaires regarding dietary and exercise habits will be completed at home by the patient. Demographic and clinical data will be collected in addition to serum, skin (via tape stripping), feces, MyFitnessPal app, and patient-reported outcomes from questionnaires (Multimedia Appendix 1).  Outcome Measures  Multimedia Appendix 1 lists the parameters per study visit.",71530800-7efc-478a-b685-bf280ca7ae94
10,methods9," During the study, data on demographics will be collected and will include age, gender, and medical and familial history. Furthermore, the disease phenotype will be assessed, and psoriasis severity will be evaluated by an independent assessor. In addition to psoriasis-related parameters, the clinical assessment will include metabolic parameters such as weight, waist circumference, BMI, and total body fat. Lifestyle habits will be registered: patients will keep a diary of their diet twice a week in the online MyFitnessPal app; in the intervention arm, this will be done on the fasting days. General diet and physical exercise habits will be recorded via the Food Frequency Questionnaire and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, respectively.",72497d1d-b84e-40e2-97a7-ab9e5c06475a
11,methods10," Questionnaires will also be used to evaluate QoL and mental health, including Dermatology Life Quality Index, EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Beck’s Depression Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and the Visual Analogue Scale for satisfaction.  Cutaneous barrier integrity will be checked through the measurement of transepidermal water loss at 2 different body sites: 1 perilesional and 1 nonlesional site. These will be documented to ensure measurement at the same body sites throughout the study.  Intestinal barrier integrity will be assessed in 2 serological and fecal samples. Permeability markers zonulin, claudin-3, and ileal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) will be quantified in serum, and calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9) will be measured in both serum and stool samples. Participants will also be asked to report on intestinal symptoms based on the Dutch questionnaire for irritable bowel syndrome (Prikkelbaar Darm Syndroom Questionnaire).",af225341-bc2b-4538-b9ea-567ff8fd98b1
12,methods11,"  Serological levels of inflammatory and metabolic messengers such as IL-6, TNF-α, leptin, and adiponectin will be measured in serum and skin. The latter will be collected through skin tape stripping at the same body sites where transepidermal water loss measurement is performed.  Finally, microbiome sampling will be performed through cutaneous and fecal samples for future follow-up projects.  Study visits will be planned on the fasting days, and participants will be scheduled in this manner to account for circadian rhythm and reduce intraindividual variability.  Sample Size Calculations  The sample size was determined by power analyses and the available study budget. It was calculated with the power calculator on the Melanoma and Skin Cancer Trial website, with a 2-tailed t test and α at .05 and power at 0.80. The predicted effect size was estimated based on a prior study of intermittent fasting [38]. We estimated that at a 2-sided P value of .",729fe523-ae87-4c05-8469-c37019eb24f2
13,methods12,"05 and with 80% power, we would need 16 participants to complete the study to detect a within-individual effect size of 0.75 SDs. We estimated a dropout rate of 20%, leading to a sample size of 20 participants. To minimize dropouts, recruiting personnel will emphasize considering the requirements of the study before enrollment begins. In cases of dropouts, extra participants will be recruited to maintain statistical power.  Statistical Analysis  The primary aim is to explore the effect of Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) on mild psoriasis. Secondary outcomes include changes from baseline to selected time-points during and postintervention in QoL, body weight, BMI, total body fat, inflammation and metabolic markers in serum and skin, and permeability markers in serum and feces. Furthermore, differences in dietary and physical exercise habits will be investigated. Comparisons will be made within a single arm (paired) and between both arms (unpaired).",dd13765d-1af0-41a9-b0be-87ce50e67e5a
14,methods13,"The chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare groups, and regression-binary logistics will be performed with identified independent variables to determine their influence on the outcome. Demographics will be analyzed as confounding variables. Cytokine data that are not normally distributed and differences in cytokine levels between groups will be analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. Correlations will be assessed using Spearman rank correlation. For each group, we will use multivariate logistic regression modeling to detect associations between cytokine levels and the primary end point, and to adjust for confounding effects of age, sex, and the intervention. Cytokine data will be log-transformed prior to use in multivariate models. Pre-existing differences between groups at baseline will be examined using a 1-way analysis of variance featuring a factor for diet allocation.",42c98be5-22f1-41cd-8bdd-5cc02c79a186
15,methods14," Significant differences emerging from these tests will be explored using appropriate post hoc tests to adjust for multiple comparisons and to isolate the source(s) of variance. In addition to these analyses at the group level, individual responses will also be closely examined for outliers that may affect interpretation. Further analysis, such as subgroup analysis, may also be conducted in light of patterns emerging in the final data set. Baseline characteristics of participants who withdraw during the fasting intervention will also be compared against the final population with t tests being used to assess tolerability. P values will be reported to 4 decimal places with P values less than .0001 being reported as P<.001. A P value <.05 will be considered statistically significant. Data analysis will be executed with SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corp) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc).",edc53db1-cfd8-44bf-ab2e-29448a35a4d7

18,discussion0," Recently, psoriasis has been accepted to be a multimorbid disease with a large impact from lifestyle factors. Obesity has been found to be an independent predictor for the development of psoriasis and to be associated with disease severity [46]. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of a gut-skin axis, which may also be of importance in psoriasis, revealing the need to urgently address the question of how diet may affect the disease. To our knowledge, the Modified Intermittent Fasting in Psoriasis (MANGO) study is the first comprehensive trial to investigate the effects of Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) on cutaneous, intestinal, and mental health in a cohort of people with psoriasis.  We expect that the Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) intervention will have beneficial effects on psoriatic lesions and be associated with favorable changes in metabolic parameters. We anticipate to detect shifts in intestinal parameters that may be associated with skin improvement.",eb92973c-2a25-4e08-838e-03e945418927
19,discussion1," In addition, the data generated from this trial will inform the design of future large-scale trials to evaluate the presence and role of the gut-skin axis in psoriasis. The study additionally includes collection of cutaneous and fecal samples for future microbiome analysis if the intervention proves beneficial.  To overcome the difficulty of diet-based interventions in terms of confounding factors and the small sample size, we have chosen the design of a prospective cross-over randomized trial. As such, each patient will be monitored over more than 6 months and serve as his or her own control. Another strength of this study is the combination of clinical, biochemical, and patient-reported outcomes for cutaneous, intestinal, and mental parameters. Moreover, since some parameters can vary, the study includes 2 baseline points in order to assess normal variation.",2dabb4c8-70a4-42e0-83d6-7858151aed04
20,discussion2," We opted to perform the pilot trial in a cohort of patients with mild psoriasis who are not on systemic agents to reduce any confounding effects of immunomodulators that may directly impact the outcomes. Lastly, since we introduced a restrictive time window for the consumption of the 500 kcal on fasting days, we will be able to reduce confounding effects of the circadian rhythm [47]. A potential limitation includes health bias among participants.  Results from this study may have multidimensional consequences and assets. On the one hand, beneficial effects of fasting may be potentially viewed as a nonpharmacological add-on treatment for psoriasis. A subset of psoriasis patients dislike pharmacological treatments and therefore opt to gain additional control over their disease through a diet.",2d385d49-46e9-4789-a55a-5e9abef6759a
21,discussion3," On the other hand, evidence that a free intervention may have health benefits in patients requiring costly drugs such as biologics may give rise to a moral dilemma: how do we define health responsibility in terms of lifestyle with the rise of health care costs? This debate, applicable to many other (chronic) illnesses, is highly relevant and should not be postponed. It should take place in the near future, with a multidisciplinary panel in a transparent manner in order to interpret the results from comparable trials.  To conclude, if patients with psoriasis tolerate Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) well and experience improvement, there is potential for the diet to be widely adopted by those with psoriasis in a sustainable manner.",0aef4836-f2dc-4e59-97da-b0295bff71f8
22,discussion4," In addition, Modified intermittent fasting (MIF) may provide a positive impact on their general health, as this diet has already proven to be effective in obesity and seems to be also effective in diabetes [48]—two common comorbidities associated with psoriasis. Given this, we may discern the importance of the gut-skin axis and use it to our advantage in the disease management of psoriasis.
