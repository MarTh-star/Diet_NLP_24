0,introduction0,"Systemic inflammation/sepsis is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia [1]. The elderly are vulnerable to the adverse effects of infections on cognitive function, and the aging process itself is associated with increased neuroinflammatory processes involving microglial activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [2,3]. Inflammation also occurs in association with the pathological changes in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and ischemic stroke [4]. However, clinical trials of anti-inflammatory therapies for AD, including NSAIDs, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors and intravenous immunoglobulin [5,6], have not been encouraging [7-10].",6c5e9b82-5bc8-4343-b531-aea38f4b5b0e
1,introduction1,"  NF-κB, the activity of which is attributed to the Rel/NF-κB family proteins forming homo- and heterodimers through the combination of the subunits p65 (or RELA), p50, p52, cREL and RELB, can be activated by lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β, and reactive oxygen species [11,12]. NF-κB, which is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm, is inhibited by a family of molecules termed inhibitor κB (IκBs). IκB binds NF-κB and masks its nuclear localization signal, thus retaining it in the cytoplasm [13]. Inducers of NF-κB act by intracellular signaling pathways that activate the IκB kinases (IKKs), which phosphorylate two specific N-terminal serines of IκBα, resulting in IκBα polyubiquitination and degradation in the 26S protease [14]. When IκB is degraded, NF-κB migrates to the nucleus, modulating the transcription of several genes associated with neurodegenerative or neuroprotective actions [15,16].",d325210a-9519-4f31-b1a4-84b29ddc3578
2,introduction2,"  Bacterial infections activate innate immune signaling pathways involving toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the transcription factor NF-κB in microglia and macrophages, which induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the production of nitric oxide [17]. These pathways play critical roles in the killing and degradation of the bacteria by immune cells, but can also adversely affect neurons. Studies of TLR4-deficient mice suggest that TLR4 signaling has a negative impact on hippocampus-dependent cognitive function [18]. Data further suggest that TLR4 activation contributes to the degeneration of neurons in experimental models of AD [19,20] and stroke [21].",16a9bd8a-59f8-4dae-8980-772ac8deda80
3,introduction3," Lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) is a major bacterial TLR4 ligand that activates the innate immune response to infection, and administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can cause cognitive impairment in animal models by mechanisms involving expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of neurotrophic factor production [22-26]. It is known that pro-inflammatory mediators disrupt hippocampal neuronal functions, including long-term potentiation and working memory consolidation [27,28]. Cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β and IL-6 are involved in hippocampal long-term potentiation and dendritic branching, which are processes involved in memory formation and maintenance [29]. In addition, it has already been shown that systemic administration of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α reduces cell proliferation in the hippocampus, whereas no effect is observed with single doses of IL-1β and IL-6 [30].",96d29a62-5647-4320-9ff6-64134e8d3713
4,introduction4,"  IF can improve cognitive function in mouse models relevant to AD [31,32] and in old rats [33]. Also, IF reduces brain damage, increases levels of neurotrophic factors, and reduces markers of inflammation in a mouse model of focal ischemic stroke [34]. Here, we report that IF ameliorates cognitive deficits in a rat model of systemic bacterial infection, by a mechanism involving suppression of neuroinflammation and maintenance of neurotrophic support. Our findings suggest a potential for application of IF for the prevention and treatment of the cognitive deficits resulting from systemic inflammation.  Material and methods Animals Adult 12-week-old male Wistar rats were kept under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and allowed free access to water. All treatments were administered between 9:00 and 10:00 am. Rats were randomly assigned to a normal feeding group and an alternate-day fasting diet (IF). Rats on the IF diet were deprived of food for 24 hours every other day for 30 days.",ae20f6ca-ee1e-4a23-bb23-23f44c1a2855
5,introduction5," On the 31st day, after being given ad libitum access to food for 24 hours to avoid the effects of acute fasting, each animal received 1 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (O111:B4) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) or saline intravenously [35]. Thus, four groups were used: saline (Control), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), IF with saline (IF) and IF with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (IF + lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge was performed approximately three hours after lights on (ranging from 09:00 am to 10:00 am). Half of the rats were subjected to behavioral tests, and the other half were euthanized two hours after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration [35] and the hippocampus was dissected and frozen for analyses, according to the timelines shown in Figure 1. This research was approved by the Biomedical College of Animal Experimentation (College of Animal Experimentation (COBEA)).",0a414836-63d7-4b22-afca-93bf4d17fb02

Figure 1 Design of experiments to determine the effects of intermittent fasting (IF) on cognitive function and hippocampal neuroinflammation. (A) For the biochemical experiments, rats were subjected to IF or ad libitum Control diets for 30 days. To determine whether IF modulated the inflammatory response to a subsequent challenge, rats were injected intravenously with either 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) or saline on day 31, and 2 hours later brain tissue and serum samples were collected for subsequent analysis. (B) For the behavioral experiments, rats were subjected to the habituation session of the Barnes maze and were immediately injected intravenously with either 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline on day 31.",1fd06cd5-b1c2-48b8-aacf-409b99717e3a
7,introduction7," Barnes maze testing sessions and inhibitory avoidance tests were performed on days 32 to 36 and 37 to 38, respectively. Locomotor activity test was performed 24 hours after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration and rotarod tests were performed on days 32 to 35.  Locomotor activity test Spontaneous locomotor activity was measured using an electronic animal activity meter (model 7430, Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). The apparatus consisted of a transparent acrylic cage (35 cm × 23 cm × 20 cm) with a set of horizontal sensors to register locomotor activity and a set of vertical sensors to register rearing activity. Rats were placed into the center of cage and allowed to explore the apparatus for five minutes while the horizontal (locomotion) and vertical (rearing) movements were captured. Thereafter, rats were returned to their home cages. The open field was cleaned with 5% ethyl alcohol and allowed to dry between tests.",c30a5c2a-1211-4899-b33d-13634f72f8e5
8,introduction8,"  Rotarod Motor performance was tested using the ENV-577 M Rotarod system (Med Associates, Georgia, VT, USA). The time spent on the rotating rod was measured for each animal during 300-second trials. The speed of rod rotation was increased progressively from 3 to 30 rpm during the 300-second period. This test consisted of four consecutive days of testing sessions with two trials per day. The Rotarod system was cleaned with 5% ethyl alcohol between tests.  Barnes maze Spatial learning ability was examined in the Barnes maze using methods described previously [36]. The Barnes maze apparatus is an opaque disc 100 cm in diameter elevated 1 m above the floor by a tripod. Twenty holes, 8 cm in diameter, are located 9.5 cm from the perimeter, and a black escape box is placed under one of the holes. Distinct spatial cues are located all around the maze and are kept constant throughout the study. A fluorescent lamp (21 W) was placed above the center of the arena.",3c872034-dbb5-44ab-83f1-669e4fac6bfc
9,introduction9," A naive set of previously untested animals was positioned under an acrylic dome in the middle of the maze for one minute. Once the dome was lifted, the animal was able to orient to spatial cues and find the hole with the hidden burrow. The session ended when the rat entered the escape burrow or after five minutes had elapsed. If the rat did not enter the burrow by itself, it was gently guided and allowed to remain there for one minute before being returned to its home cage. This test consisted of one day of habituation session and five consecutive days of testing sessions with two trials per day. The location of the burrow was the same for each individual rat, but position was changed among rats in a group. The maze was cleaned with 5% ethyl alcohol to remove any odor trails. Rats are expected to reduce their latency to find the burrow, as a measure of spatial memory.",f4e251dd-b1e9-4d29-a950-ff88e5d434a7
10,introduction10," Because the Barnes maze lacks strong reinforcement stimuli, rats may lack motivation and occasionally explore the maze after finding the target hole without entering. To rectify this confounding factor, we used the primary latency, which is the time elapsed to the first encounter of the escape burrow.  Inhibitory avoidance The inhibitory avoidance apparatus (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy) consisted of two acrylic compartments of the same size, one illuminated and the other dark, separated by an automatic door. The floor of both chambers was made of stainless steel rods and the floor of the dark chamber can be electrified. On the training session, animals were placed individually in the lighted compartment and the door was opened. Once the animal entered the dark compartment, the door was closed and an electric foot-shock (0.5 mA, 2 seconds in duration) was delivered through the grid floor.",b57ae3db-6c82-401d-a21b-7ba15a32065a
11,introduction11," The animal was removed from the dark compartment and returned to its home cage immediately after receiving this shock. Twenty-four hours later the animals were subjected to the test session. Animals that failed to enter the dark compartment in 5 minutes were removed from the apparatus and assigned a ceiling score of 300 seconds. Long-term memory was assigned as the longer the animal stayed in the light chamber. The training session was performed on the day after the end of the Barnes maze test.  Nuclear extracts Nuclear extracts of each hippocampus were prepared as previously described [37]. Briefly, hippocampal structures were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in cold PBS supplemented with, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin and 2.5 μg/ml antipain, and centrifuged at 4°C for 30 seconds at 12,000 × g.

The resulting supernatants containing nuclear proteins were stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA, USA) colorimetric assay [38].  Electrophoretic mobility shift assay Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)) for NF-κB was performed by using the gel shift assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI, USA), as described previously [37].",04eef196-7f48-4bd2-8727-69c4c7f40767
13,introduction13," 32P-NF-κB double-stranded consensus oligonucleotide probe (5’-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3’; 25,000 cpm) and nuclear extracts (15 μg) were used. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis through a 6% non-denaturing acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (37.5:1) gel in 0.53 Tris-borate/EDTA (Tris borate/EDTA (TBE)) for two hours at 150 V. Gels were vacuum dried and analyzed by autoradiography. For competition experiments, NF-κB and transcription initiation factor II (TFIID; 5’-GCAGAGCATATAAGGTGAGGTAGGA-3’) unlabeled double-stranded consensus oligonucleotide was included in 20-fold molar excess over the amount of 32P-NF-κB probe to detect specific and nonspecific DNA-protein interactions, respectively. Unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture 20 minutes before the radioactive probe.",81a5bf66-4016-4a81-ab05-71c6e18fc791
14,introduction14," Supershift assay incubations, using antibodies against different NF-κB subunits (p50, p52, cREL and RELA, 1:20 dilution), were also conducted according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) before the incubation of nuclear extracts with the labeled oligonucleotide. Autoradiographs were visualized with a photodocumentation system DP-001-FDC (Vilber Lourmat, Marne la Vallée, France) and quantified in NIH ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD, USA). Several exposure times were analyzed to ensure the linearity of the band intensities.  Immunoblotting Electrophoresis was performed using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and the Bio-Rad mini-Protean III apparatus (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA). In brief, the proteins present in the hippocampus cytosolic (15 μg) and nuclear fractions (10 μg) were size separated in 10% SDS-PAGE (90 V).",54a0881a-c4b6-420b-8448-522ccba4918f
15,introduction15," The proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) and incubated with specific antibodies against RELA (sc-372; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The Ponceau method of immunoblotting was used to ensure equal protein loading [39]. Proteins recognized by antibodies were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)) technique, following the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England). The membranes were exposed to x-ray film. To quantify the immunoblots, we used the NIH ImageJ software Bethesda, MA, USA). Several exposure times were analyzed to ensure the linearity of the band intensities. β-ACTIN antibody (sc-1616; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used as an internal control for the experiments.

Concentrations of serum IL-1α and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, and tissue IL-1β and IL-10, were consistently below the level of detection of the assay. Therefore, we measured IL-10 and IL-1β levels in hippocampal extracts and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α in serum by a conventional ELISA kit.  ELISA Hippocampal levels of IL-1β and IL-10, and serum levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α were measured by ELISA using eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) kits, and hippocampal levels of brain-derived fa (brain derived fa (BDNF)) were measured using a Promega ELISA kit (Madison, WI, USA).",61423b20-a260-473f-9cab-a20002fdc36a
18,introduction18," To measure Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β and IL-10 levels, serum was isolated within 30 minutes after blood (5 ml) collection by centrifuging at 3,000 × g for 10 minutes, and cytosolic hippocampal extract was isolated by homogenizing hippocampi structures using a Dounce homogenizer in cold PBS supplemented with 0.5 mM PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin and 2.5 μg/ml antipain, and centrifuging at 4°C for 30 seconds at 12,000 × g.

25,results0,"Intermittent fasting ameliorates memory deficits caused by experimental systemic inflammation The designs of experiments for tissue collection and behavioral testing are shown in Figure 1. Rats were maintained on either ad libitum (Control) or IF diets for 30 days and were then administered either vehicle (saline) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intravenously. The animals of both groups were weighed before and after IF. The results showed that IF rats had increased body mass after 30 days of diet (Δ = 26.1 ± 3.0 g) but this increase was lower than that of the Control group (Δ = 57.1 ± 3.0 g) (*P < 0.05, Student’s t-test). Therefore, IF animals did gain body weight during the 30 days period, suggesting that IF did not interfere in the development of the animal. Such findings suggest that the animals did not consume twice their daily food intake on the ad libitum feeding day, which resulted in a reduced body weight gain.",816ada8c-fb94-46ae-89d6-b363f80ebe1f
26,results1,"  In the Barnes maze test, all rats were able to learn the location of the escape burrow, as latency to find the escape box decreased across the five blocks of daily observation in all groups (F(4,194) = 20.31, P < 0.001 - Figure 2A). Moreover, treatment of animals with IF produced a significant difference in their performance in the maze (F(3,194) = 4.43, P < 0.01). Bonferroni post-test analysis indicated significantly shorter latencies for IF and IF + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) groups when compared to animals injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (P < 0.001) at trial one. As all animals experienced a previous day of habituation, these data suggest that IF increased their capacity to perform the learning and memory task in the presence of the inflammatory insult. In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated animals did not acquire the information (impaired learning) and, because of this, in the first evaluation day, they had a worse performance.",6b5f495a-f56d-41e0-b756-9b30a0ef7b21

Similarly, performances of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated groups were indistinguishable from Control and IF groups regarding the latency to fall from a rotating rod (Figure 2C).

Figure 3A shows that nuclear translocation of NF-κB was significantly increased by IF itself and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in the presence or absence of IF. To verify the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB, Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with nuclear proteins isolated from rat hippocampus. Results showed that the binding activity of NF-κB was increased by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment and also by IF and IF + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (Figure 3B).",af3fe914-2320-48f9-8dbc-dba412dc5e76
32,results7," However, NF-κB activation and RELA translocation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in both groups (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IF + lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) were similar and they were also higher than the IF group, suggesting a different pattern of response. Interestingly, hippocampal nuclear extracts of all groups analyzed exhibited a similar pattern of four DNA/protein complexes (Figure 3C, D and E). The upper complexes 1 and 2 were displaced by an excess of unlabeled NF-κB, but not TFIID double-stranded oligonucleotide consensus sequence, demonstrating the specificity of NF-κB/DNA binding interaction (Figure 3C, D and E). The lower complexes were less efficiently displaced by unlabeled NF-κB probe. Supershift analysis indicated that the antibody against the subunit RELA was able to shift DNA/protein interaction present in complex 1. The antibody against the subunit p50 shifted complex 2 and induced a partial decrease in complex 1 (Figure 3C, D and E).",37b384f5-bd12-4e67-8357-bd81a5f1ce6a
33,results8," The presence of antibodies against the subunits cREL (Figure 3C, D and E) and p52 (data not shown) did not affect DNA-protein complexes. Taken together, these results indicated that p50/RELA heterodimers and p50/p50 homodimers were included in 32P-NF-κB/protein complexes 1 and 2, respectively. Complexes 3 and 4 were not displaced by the antibodies and were not considered related to NF-κB family.  Figure 3 Lipopolysaccharide lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) treatment and intermittent fasting (IF) increase the NF-κB nuclear translocation and binding activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)) and Western blot were performed using nuclear extract (10 μg) from rat hippocampus. (A) Western blot results using antibodies to RELA and β-ACTIN showed that IF and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment with or without IF increased the nuclear translocation of RELA.",ca650c78-e477-497a-b450-2f96f25186de
34,results9," (B) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment increased the NF-κB binding activity in rats submitted or not to IF protocol. IF by itself also increased NF-κB binging activity. Competition and supershift assays of NF-κB activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (C), IF (D) and IF with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (E) were carried out. Competition studies were performed using the nuclear extract in the absence or presence of unlabeled specific (NF-κB consensus sequence, 20-fold molar excess) or nonspecific (TFIID consensus sequence, 20-fold molar excess) oligonucleotide, as indicated. Supershift assays were performed with the same nuclear extract incubated in the absence or presence of antibodies (1:20 dilution) against subunits p50, RELA, and cREL as indicated.

Intermittent fasting reduces levels of hippocampal Tlr-4 and iNos mRNAs Because TLR4 and iNOS mediate adverse effects of systemic inflammation/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hippocampal plasticity [18,42,43], we measured levels of mRNAs encoding TLR4 and iNOS in hippocampal samples from rats in the four groups. After normalization with the housekeeping Hprt mRNA levels, the expression levels were presented as a relative fold change compared with the Control group. The Tlr-4 mRNA levels were significantly lower in hippocampi of rats in the IF and IF + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) groups compared to the Control group (Figure 4A).

37,results12,"  IF suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced accumulation of inflammatory proteins in the hippocampus In view of the important role played by cytokines and chemokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation [23,24,26,44], we investigated the levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, Interferon (IFN)-γ, and RANTES) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the periphery (serum) and in the hippocampus, a brain region in which neuroinflammation occurs in response to brain injury and systemic inflammation [45,46]. Multiplex and ELISA immunoassay showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused a significant increase of IL-1α (Figure 5A), IL-1β (Figure 5B), and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α (Figure 5C) in the hippocampus, and IL-1β (Figure 5 F), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α (Figure 5G), IL-6 (Figure 5H), RANTES (Figure 5I), and Interferon (IFN)-γ (Figure 5 J) in the serum.",9d79d652-d5fc-46a9-8084-55aa4df2e642
38,results13," Remarkably, IF significantly attenuated or completely prevented the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increases in all of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus and serum (Figure 5).

IF prevents lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced reduction of hippocampal brain derived fa (BDNF) levels brain derived fa (BDNF) plays an important role in memory and neuroprotection [47]. In our model, we found by ELISA immunoassay that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment significantly reduced hippocampal brain derived fa (BDNF) levels when compared to all other groups (Figure 6). This was not observed in the IF + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group (Figure 6), suggesting that IF can prevent the reduction of hippocampal brain derived fa (BDNF) levels caused by systemic inflammation.

41,discussion0,"A wide array of health benefits of IF have been identified in animal models and human studies [48]. In contrast, no studies evaluating the effect of IF in neuroinflammatory processes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration have been conducted to date. Based on studies showing that IF can protect neurons against degeneration in animal models of injury that involve local inflammatory processes (stroke and seizures) and an AD model [31,32,34], and evidence that sepsis can cause cognitive impairment in human subjects [49], we asked whether IF might modify the adverse effects of systemic inflammation on cognitive function. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to elicit an immune response, we observed significant impairment of memory performance in Barnes maze and inhibitory avoidance tests that was counteracted by IF.  The Barnes circular platform was chosen as a spatial memory paradigm [50].",016bb47f-eb8c-4156-b107-ad84c36dc835
42,discussion1," This task is less stressful than the water maze [51] and is based on the natural tendency of mice to explore and escape through holes [52,53]. We observed that, despite all groups having learned the burrow location across successive days, there was a significant effect of IF in improving the performance of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats compared to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats on the Control ad libitum diet. The step-through inhibitory avoidance test is based on the natural dark-seeking behavior of rats and evaluates long-term, declarative memory. It is a fear-motivated task in which the rat refrains from stepping through a door to an apparently safer dark compartment previously linked to a punishment [54,55]. Our results showed that animals treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) without IF did not remember the aversive stimulus (foot-shock), unlike the animals previously subjected to IF.",a3971807-28ed-4932-8247-d4b43d12e660
43,discussion2," The similar motor performance exhibited by all groups (Control, IF, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IF + lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) during the learning phase in Barnes and inhibitory avoidance behavioral assays as well as results from electronic motor activity meter and rotarod apparatus confirmed that the IF effect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory impairment is not linked to changes in general activity or motor performance differences. Therefore, data here showed that IF effectively prevented the memory deficit induced by systemic inflammatory bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, suggesting a potential application of such diets to those with or at risk for cognitive impairment.  Cognitive decline is prominent in AD, and also occurs in other disorders in which neuroinflammation is believed to play a prominent role [44]. Thus, the next step was to evaluate the effects of IF on neuroinflammatory processes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.",9da0c740-7f66-4931-8ce0-7207421971fd
44,discussion3," Confirming our previous results [35,56], lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates nuclear RELA translocation and NF-κB binding activity increasing pro-inflammatory genes within two hours in rat hippocampus. Although IF also induced an increase in NF-κB activation and nuclear RELA translocation, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response in the presence or absence of IF was higher when compared to the IF group. Based on the evidence that NF-κB nuclear extracts of all groups analyzed presented a similar pattern of four DNA/protein complexes, we consider that IF induced different changes in the expression of NF-κB target genes involved in synaptic plasticity and cell survival linked to a cell specific NF-κB activation when compared to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), since IF is mediating a shift in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression towards an anti-inflammatory signaling cascade.",eb414e68-9534-4f2b-96f0-5849f9aa3918
45,discussion4," In fact, there is evidence supporting a dual role of NF-κB in neurodegenerative diseases in the central nervous system (central nervous system (CNS)); activation of NF-κB in neurons promotes their survival, whereas activation in glial and immune cells mediates pathological inflammatory processes [16]. Confirming this hypothesis, we found that levels of multiple markers of neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via NF-κB activation were reduced in rats on the IF diet compared to those on the Control diet, including iNOS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor TLR4.",a883ab6c-3b84-46f9-84cb-9f95065977bc
46,discussion5," In addition, our previous results showed that the chronic unpredictable stress (chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)) protocol also induced an increase in NF-κB activation and nuclear RELA translocation, but different from IF, chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) augmented the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on NF-κB activation and nuclear RELA translocation in hippocampus, as well as the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on expression of the pro-inflammatory genes [56]. Therefore, while chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced sensitization of microglia reactivity (‘priming’ stress effects) enhances inflammation [57], IF is probably acting by engaging an adaptive cellular stress-response signaling pathways in neurons, thus decreasing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response [58].  TLR4 is expressed in astrocytes, microglia and neurons wherein its activation can adversely affect neuronal plasticity and survival in brain injury settings [21,59].",5c36b881-df55-45f6-90a3-67a2a4bcaeca
47,discussion6," In addition, TLR4 signaling inhibits neurogenesis [60], which may contribute to the impairment of cognitive function by neuroinflammation. Here, we showed that IF inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators including Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-1β, RANTES, and iNos. These effects of IF are indicative of decreased activation of inflammatory cascades linked to NF-κB mediating pro-inflammatory response [14,61]. In fact, it is known that high concentrations of NO, unlike low concentrations [42,43], may promote excitotoxicity, which may contribute to cognitive impairment [43,62-64]. Our results showed that IF was able to mitigate the induction of iNos expression by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",3b53381a-3637-4e16-a1ba-f120c20b3ffd
48,discussion7," This result may indicate that the improved memory performance observed in the IF + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group may be related to a reduction of hippocampal iNos and consequently the pathological levels of NO, which could generate a cognitive deficit.  We also found that IF increases levels of IL-10, a cytokine that is known to counteract NF-κB pro-inflammatory signaling. The pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α plays a central role in the onset and maintenance of inflammation [65], while IL-10 is a prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine in that it inhibits production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, Interferon (IFN)-γ and RANTES [66,67]. IL-10 also acts as a natural antagonist of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α by inhibiting the NF-κB inflammatory signaling through the preservation of the inhibitory protein IκB [68].",d7157da7-5c3b-4bc2-9784-b199b23185cc
49,discussion8," Therefore, IF simultaneously suppresses pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and activates at least one anti-inflammatory pathway.  Neuroinflammatory conditions such as traumatic brain injury, AD, Down syndrome and aging are frequently associated with cognitive impairment [69-71], and there is considerable evidence for an association between cytokine expression in the brain and cognitive deficits, including memory deficits [72-74]. For instance, it has been shown that Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 are critical for neuroinflammation-induced memory impairment [75-77]. Also, it is well defined that acute inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-1β injection causes memory deficits [28,78-82]. Accordingly, it was previously shown that hippocampal IL-1β overexpression impairs contextual and spatial long-term memory [74], while IL-10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness behavior and tribulations in hippocampal-dependent memory [73].",a4dd66a4-17bd-4aba-955d-d44c9165b68a
50,discussion9,"  Previous studies have shown that caloric restriction and IF reduce levels of circulating pro-inflammatory IL-1β and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, and increase anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels in animal models and human subjects [83-85]. In the brain, IL-10 may inhibit the development and progression of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the onset of neuroinflammation and progression of prion disease was accelerated in mice deficient in IL-10 [86]. In the present study, IF exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by increasing hippocampal IL-10 levels, and by preventing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increases in IL-1α, IL-1β, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, and RANTES levels. IF also inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increases in serum Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, RANTES and Interferon (IFN)-γ, suggesting that IF anti-inflammatory effect is not restricted to the central nervous system (CNS).",231ce8bf-6baa-442e-b515-d747cacb2545
51,discussion10,"  Finally, our findings suggest that IF can sustain neurotrophic support for hippocampal neurons in the setting of systemic inflammation. The hippocampus has been demonstrated to be a major brain structure involved in spatial learning [87]. It was previously demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduces hippocampal mRNA levels of brain derived fa (BDNF), a neurotrophin that plays an important role in learning and memory processes [88]. Accordingly, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration caused a reduction in brain derived fa (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus of rats on the Control diet, but not in rats on the IF diet. Thus, in addition to suppressing the local (hippocampal) and systemic inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IF prevented the reduction of brain derived fa (BDNF) levels in this animal model of systemic inflammation.",e77c7378-af76-4c12-aaaf-5c41232e3e00
52,discussion11," Because brain derived fa (BDNF) plays critical roles in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, it is likely that maintenance of brain derived fa (BDNF) signaling contributes to the beneficial effects of IF on cognitive function in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats. Previous studies have provided evidence that brain derived fa (BDNF) is a key target of NF-κB involved in NMDA receptor-mediated cell survival signaling [89-92] and IF has been shown to activate glutamate signaling cascade in the central nervous system (CNS) [58]. The ability of IF to suppress inflammatory processes and sustain hippocampal brain derived fa (BDNF) levels in the face of systemic inflammation, suggests that IF interventions should be evaluated in studies of human subjects at risk for or suffering from neurological conditions involving neuroinflammation.",19a792d7-76fb-4b27-817a-914e2ef0415f
