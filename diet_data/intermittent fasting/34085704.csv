28,discussion0," Inflammation caused by degradation products of red blood cells (RBCs) following intracerebral hemorrhage leads to severe secondary brain injury, which is a major reason leading to neuronal apoptosis and worsening prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) [24]. However, there is no effective clinical intervention so far. The present study demonstrated for the first that intermittent fasting protected against intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced neurologic deficits in both short and long terms by suppressing microglia-driven inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis. Notably, genetic deletion of microglia Sirt3 abolished the beneficial effects of IF through inhibiting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in the acute stage after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). These results suggested a critical role of Sirt3 in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced brain injury, especially in regulating neuroinflammatory responses after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

In central nervous system (CNS) disorders, IF has been shown to improve cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease and neuropsychiatric diseases [14, 28]. A recent study supports the notion that IF alleviates poststroke brain damage via altering epigenetic and transcriptional programming [17]. In the present study, we have explored whether IF has any effects on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced brain damage. Our results indicates that every-other-day feed strategy ameliorates intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced neurological functional deficits in mice at day 3–28.",a7442279-60e8-486c-928f-61047b04bf51
30,discussion2," The protective effects of IF may be partly through enhancing hematoma clearance and reducing brain edema after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Furthermore, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α was suppressed by IF treatment in the multiple phases of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), strongly supporting the essential role of inflammation in functional recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which may be the underlying mechanism contributed to the neuroprotective effects of IF. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of IF were limited at day 1 in our study. The underlying reason maybe that it doesn’t work directly on the brain but through a systematic response. A body of literature has shown that intermittent fasting or calorie restriction works by regulating energetic metabolism 12 to 24 h later after depletion of carbohydrates [26].",02b4e845-f79f-4be4-9cfa-96157375c609
31,discussion3," Besides, IF has been proved to effectively restored the gut microbiome, and then probably influences neurological function [29], which is an increasingly popular research topic in recent years. Therefore, intermittent fasting probably protect brain from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) insult through shifting energetic metabolism after a certain time. However, whether this assumption holds still requires further investigation.  Microglia are known as the main innate immune cells in central nervous system (CNS) which evoke inflammatory mediator release when sense danger signals after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) insult [8]. Increasing evidence has indicated that the inhibition of activated microglia ameliorate neuronal injuries after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) [30]. Consistent with the previous studies, we find the potential link between downregulated Iba-1+ microglia number by IF and improved neurological function at day 3 and 28 after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).",8d623332-3c8b-4319-87e7-0613621df81c
32,discussion4," However, the other major function of microglia is to engulf RBCs and remove cellular debris [31]. Under certain conditions, microglia can also express arginase1 (Arg1), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), Ym1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and IL-4, which facilitate recovery of central nervous system (CNS) injury including ischemic stroke [32]. Considering the high plasticity of microglia according to different pathologic events or microenvironments [33], deeper insight into the regulatory mechanisms of microglial phenotype variations may help maintain the homeostasis of microglia activation. Intriguingly, in the present study, IF increased Iba-1+ microglia at day 7 after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) while supressed proinflammatory cytokine release. To gain an initial understanding of the characteristics of the increased microglia, we used the fluorescence double-labeling and found most of these microglia expressed the anti-inflammatory marker Arg1.",c96000ed-97d0-4b6e-b816-365085b4a0c1
33,discussion5," It is possible that IF promotes microglia polarize to the anti-inflammatory subtype at the subacute stage after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Besides, although IF decreased the number of Iba-1+ microglia at the acute stage, the hematoma clearance was enhanced. The clearance of hematoma may depend on some unknown cells other than activated microglia which still need further investigations.  The underlying mechanisms of IF in regulating inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are still unknown. It has been reported that energy deficiency caused by IF leads metabolic changes to oxidative phosphorylation and maintain stable mitochondrial function [16, 34]. In these processes, Sirtuin family proteins probably have a crucial role. Sirtuin-3 (Sirt3) is one of the important and extensively studied proteins of Sirutins which locates mainly in mitochondria and regulates mitochondrial functions and energy metabolism in a variety of physiological and pathological processes [35].",506e052d-ad7b-45f2-9ba6-148ba5a03ada
34,discussion6," To uncover whether Sirt3 participates in the IF-induced anti-inflammatory functions, we first analysed the protein levels of Sirt3 in microglia treated with IF and found the potential positive effects on regulating Sirt3 expression by IF. A conditional microglia-specific Sirt3 depletion mouse strain is further applied to explore its effects under the condition of energy restriction after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Mice lacking Sirt3 in microglia have poor neurological functional retention in both short and long terms treated with IF. In addition, the proinflammatory markers, such as CD16, CCL3, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α increased in Sirt3f/fCx3cr1-Cre mice compared with Sirt3f/f mice at day 3 after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), while the anti-inflammatory markers decreased at day7, suggesting that IF may act through microglial Sirt3 to manipulate neuroinflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).",915625dd-5069-4b1d-914e-ace92c70c573
35,discussion7," It is worth noting, though, Cx3cr1-driven Cre recombinase is a widely used genetic tool for enabling gene manipulation in microglia [36, 37], nonmicroglial cells expressing Cx3cr1, such as macrophage and leakiness of cre activity into neurons have become a major concern [38]. In the present study, conditional knockout of Sirt3 in cells with Cx3cr1 promoter attenuated the protective effects of IF. It is reasonable to get the view that Sirt3 in microglia participates in the effects of IF, while there may be other cells included since it is hardly to distinguish nonmicroglia, which was a limitation of our work.  As reported, Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway has been proved to function as one of the key molecular mechanisms participating in oxidative stress and inflammatory activity in multiple organs and cells including colon, kidney and brain [39–41].",351c479e-b16c-478b-94c7-0a76d76d54b6
36,discussion8," Under the condition of dietary energy restriction, Nrf2 activity can be reinforced therefore regulates the transcription, modification, or expression of downstream proteins, such as HO-1, glutathione (glutathione (GSH)), superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase (SOD)) and fibroblast growth factor (fibroblast growth factor (FGF)) [42, 43]. It has been previously reported that in mice AD model, IF has the beneficial effects on anxiety and cognition which is mediated by Sirt3 through increasing the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) [28]. Correspondently, in Sirt3 null mice, the application of Nrf2 agonist dimethyl fumarate (DMF) can suppress the release of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α as well as increase HO-1 expression at a certain level although not to the baseline of WT mice. These finding illustrates that Nrf2/HO-1 pathway may be at least partly associated with neurological adaptations and inflammatory inhibition by IF after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).",ae84060e-86cc-43e2-b211-f944a091d579
37,discussion9,"  Conclusions  In conclusion, our results revealed that IF limits neurological deficits and neuronal apoptosis in early intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) injury, and has a long-term protective effects against neuroinflammation. The neuroprotective effects of IF are mediated at least partly through Sirt3/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in microglia (Fig. 8). However, the possible link in the neuronal network between microglia and neurons under the above condition still need further study. Overall, IF may considerably serve as a potential nonpharmacological dietary paradigm treating intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).Fig. 8 IF alleviated neurological deficits and supressed neuroinflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) via Sirt3/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway  Supplementary Information  Additional file 1.
