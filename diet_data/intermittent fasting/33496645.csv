Intermittent fasting has become a popular option to manage weight, improve fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity.  This study will investigate the feasibility and efficacy of intermittent fasting in people with insulin‐treated type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The information gained will enhance our understanding of fasting interventions, which can be used to improve clinical dietary recommendations.  1 INTRODUCTION  Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia and impaired carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism caused by complete or partial insufficiency of insulin secretion and/or insulin action. 1  Reduction of body weight has been a key strategy in mitigating the risk of developing diabetes.",31711d95-068b-4448-80e9-5d0be6f8df97
4,methods3," 2 Among obese and people with prediabetes, a weight loss of 5%–7% improves fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity. 3 , 4  The most commonly used approach for weight loss is daily caloric restriction. In recent years, intermittent fasting has become a prominent approach because it consists of only a restricted food intake on either specific days of the week or during a predefined period of the day.  A subtype of intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting comprises food restriction and normal food consumption on a day‐to‐day alternating basis, has been shown to reduce body weight by 8% in obese people after 3–24 weeks of treatment. Additionally, a reduction in triglycerides, low‐density lipoprotein (low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and insulin resistance has been documented.",49d090e7-3478-4855-a0e7-540bc9fd4097

For example, insulin dose decreases following weight loss will diminish the full impact of the weight loss on HbA1c reduction, while in contrast HbA1c reductions can simply be achieved by insulin dose increases without a contribution of the dietary intervention. Hence, as the parameters are interrelated, we believe that besides looking at the HbA1c change, it is also crucial to investigate a composite of weight, glycaemic control and insulin dose reduction.",52c1f520-e3c3-40d8-b780-d36e92b9f0d9
14,methods13," A weight loss of equal or more than 2% would indicate a weight change beyond the daily fluctuation. 24 An insulin dose reduction of 10% or more is a pragmatic estimate and indicates better insulin sensitivity 25 and an HbA1c reduction of at least 0.3% would be considered clinically meaningful. 26  2.8 Intervention and investigations  The flow chart of the intervention is shown in Figure 1.  FIGURE 1 Flow chart of the intervention (an optional single follow‐up after 1 year will be added)  46 participants (23 per group) with insulin‐treated type 2 diabetes mellitus are randomly assigned to ‘intermittent fasting’ or ‘control group’, in a 1:1 ratio. Intermittent fasting comprises 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) of 75% caloric restriction (i.e. only 25% of the recommended calorie intake; this intake is only allowed as breakfast and/or lunch to maintain an 18 hours period of fasting) and 4 days (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday) of 0% caloric restriction (i.e.",16bf13cd-040f-44b6-952b-26095c90c509

Insulin and c‐peptide are measured by chemiluminescence on an ADVIA Centaur system (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Leptin is measured using an ELISA kit (DRG Instruments GmbH). Routine parameters are determined using a cobas® analyzer (Roche Diagnostics).  2.8.,6525db3e-1cd7-4348-b83d-70177b23e774

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be further analysed using single‐cell sequencing technique in collaboration with the Division of Cardiology at the Medical University of Graz, Austria.  2.8.4 Oral glucose tolerance test  Participants are asked to postpone their insulin injection until the end of the oGTT. Insulin, C‐peptide and glucose are measured before (−5), 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after ingestion of 75 g glucose (®Glucoral 75 citron, Germania Pharmazeutika). In addition, lipid parameters (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), free fatty acids) and a routine safety lab are measured.",c777491c-3d6c-463e-a855-30bb8970377b

A sensor is introduced through the skin into the subcutaneous fat tissue. The upper arm is the main body location to applicate the sensors which are worn for 16 weeks (4 weeks insulin switch phase and 12 weeks intervention phase) by the participants. The Abbott sensor is factory calibrated and therefore does not require calibration by capillary prick blood. However, participants are instructed to scan the sensor with the corresponding recorder at least every 8 h. CGM data will be collected at on‐site visits.  2.8.",2e3b1285-40e3-477a-950a-bf8390a9737f

The three‐axial acceleration sensor has a range of ±8 g, a resolution of 12 bit and a sampling rate of 128 Hz. The recognition of different activities is based on the extraction of mathematical and statistical features of the raw acceleration signal. Calculated features are maximum frequency, step count, and the number of mean crossings.  2.8.10 Faeces sampling and microbiome analysis  Sampling is performed with two stool collection tubes (Sarstedt), using a stool collector (Süsse Stuhlfänger).",3443f32e-d642-4889-8e9b-90214760496a

Bacterial DNA is extracted from stool samples using the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit III (Roche). 16S rRNA is sequenced with next‐generation sequencing technology (Illumina MiSeq) and interpreted by the respective software analysers.  2.8.11 Resting metabolic rate  The resting metabolic rate (RMR) is a component of energy expenditure that is measured by indirect calorimetry (IC). Participants must rest at least 30‐min after at least 8 h of sleep and after at least 3 h of fasting. The measurements take place for at least 30 min and are performed in standard neutral hospital room temperature. A breath mask is placed over the head of the participant. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are measured and energy expenditure is calculated by the Weir formula. 28  2.8.,80466c60-87b4-4b6a-a9f4-3833dc25ffd4

33,methods32," Another strength of this study is the insulin dose adjustment plan for fasting participants, which can be adapted and used by the participants beyond the scope of the study.  A challenge of this study is the fact the HbA1c level cannot be evaluated separately from the insulin dose. Hence, we have introduced a composite end point that captures glucose lowering, insulin dose reduction and body weight reduction. Another limitation is the duration of 12 weeks designed to establish the safety and efficacy of the intermittent fasting intervention in this participant group, however, further research is needed to explore the effects of intermittent fasting over a longer time period. Another limitation of this study is that the CGM is not blinded. Participants in the control group are able to see the changes in glucose levels depending on their food intake, which could lead to a change in eating habits potentially lowering HbA1c levels.  4 ",d96cabed-e446-458e-9402-113a373f82f2
34,discussion0,"  Previously, intermittent fasting was shown to cause weight loss of 3%–8% over 3–24 weeks and to reduce waist circumference by 4%–7%, which indicates that people lost some abdominal fat, associated with insulin resistance and related diseases. 37 Although reducing insulin resistance is beneficial in people with diabetes, it also bears the risk of hypoglycaemia in people treated with insulin. Data from Ramadan studies are available, showing mitigation of hypoglycaemia during Ramadan using the flash glucose monitoring system. 38 However, data from randomized controlled trials are largely missing.  Hence, our study aims to investigate the impact of a 12 weeks intermittent fasting intervention on glycaemic control, weight loss, insulin dose reduction and hence a combination of those single end point parameters.",97470243-fa51-4a98-a05e-a368b9d812d7
35,discussion1," Moreover, this study will provide important information regarding the safety of intermittent fasting in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus using basal bolus insulin treatment and guidance on how the insulin dose should be adjusted in this population.
