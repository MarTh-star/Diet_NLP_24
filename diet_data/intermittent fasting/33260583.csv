Obesity has a physiologic influence on organs such as the liver, visceral fat, and the circulatory system (1). It increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes mellitus (2), cardiovascular disease (2), and several types of cancers (3). Imbalance between energy intake and expenditure is the main cause of obesity (4). Intermittent fasting (IF) is a dietary energy restriction method that reduces energy intake and thereby reduces obesity.",8b7315a2-e2e0-43f5-81f0-ece3728dfdeb
11,results2," From an evolutionary point of view, fasting is a natural phenomenon that humans and lower organisms were regularly exposed to. Humans, especially in some religious groups (5), have practiced IF for centuries, and IF has been shown to improve body composition and health (6, 7). IF reduces body weight, fat mass and caloric intake comparable to a low-fat diet, and glucose and insulin tolerance can be altered by IF (8). Moreover, IF extends overall lifespan and reduces the development of aging-related diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative diseases (9). Previous studies have shown that altering caloric intake or meal timing can delay the occurrence and development of disease and improves the health and lifespan of most organisms (10, 11). The potential physiologic processes involved in IF include periodic changes in the source of metabolic fuel, the promotion of repair mechanisms, and the optimization of healthy energy utilization by cells and body (12).",ec795e37-64c6-4ab1-ab6a-436d0e4a2a30
12,results3,"  Melatonin is a biochemical hormone secreted by the pineal gland that inhibits melanin formation (13). Melatonin-related enzymes and receptors are found in almost every tissue and cell (14), suggesting that melatonin has a wide range of functions. As a powerful antioxidant, melatonin can control the survival and differentiation of immune cells, scavenge free radicals, and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing inflammation and resisting oxidative stress (15). Melatonin can also protect the liver from oxidative stress-induced damage (16).  Previous studies have shown that melatonin drives the body's energy balance toward reducing food intake, increases energy consumption by burning brown adipose tissue, and prevents excessive weight gain (17). Melatonin reduced body weight, liver steatosis and low-grade inflammation while improving insulin resistance in high fat diet (high fat diet (HFD))-fed mice (18).",acdfa751-dab4-4f60-bf81-977e12a56a42
13,results4," Melatonin levels in the gut are at least 400 times higher than in the pineal gland, and 10–100 times higher than in the blood (19), suggesting that melatonin may play an important role in normal gut function. The role of melatonin in the prevention and treatment of intestinal diseases has been borne out by prior literatures (15, 20). Melatonin can also serve as a mediator of microbial metabolism, circadian rhythms, and intestinal mucosal immune cells (20). Melatonin treatment significantly changed the composition of the gut microbiota in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) (18). Gut microbiota, directly affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver, skin, and central nervous system, and participates in the digestion and absorption of nutrients (21, 22). Due to the interrelationship between melatonin and the gut microbiota, melatonin has been hypothesized to be involved in communication between the gut tissue and the intestinal microbiota (15).",108c3234-550f-40a3-babb-0ce7206fc8ec
14,results5," Gut bacteria has been found to recognize and respond to melatonin signals in the intestine via melatonin binding sites (23), supporting this relationship.  Lots of studies on obese people showed IF benefits for preventing metabolic disorder, however, it is deserved to find what effects IF may exert on metabolism of people on a popular normal diet. Melatonin, as a hormone regulating circadian rhythm, can also affect body weight gain and intestinal microbiota. It is interesting to explore if the interaction exits between the IF and melatonin. This study aimed to investigate the potential interaction of IF and oral melatonin on body weight, blood indices, intestinal and liver morphology, and intestinal microbiota and metabolites in an experimental mouse model.    Growth Performance  Compared with the C group, IF and melatonin did not affect cumulative food intake (Figure 1A).",990922dc-a934-4df6-a4f0-13d9942bcae6
15,results6," However, IF (F and MF) led to significantly lower BW (Figure 1B) and significantly lower BW gain (50 and 64% lower than C, respectively, Figure 1C). Food intake after fasting for 24 h sharply increased (Supplementary Figure 1A). When the mice fasted, their water intake was also lower than normal (Supplementary Figure 1B). The average dose of melatonin over the study period was shown in Supplementary Figure 1C (one cycle means a non-fasting day and a fasting day), and confirms that the average daily melatonin intake was close to 10 mg/kg. In addition, epididymal fat mass in the F and MF groups was significantly lower than in the C group (25 and 30%, respectively; Figure 1D). Melatonin alone, and the use of melatonin with fasting did not have a significant impact on BW and epididymal fat mass (P > 0.05).

(B) 3-hydroxybutyric acid abundance. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, n = 12; Labeled means without a common letter differ (P < 0.05), NS: P ≥ 0.05. C, control; F, intermittent fasting; M, melatonin; MF, intermittent fasting plus melatonin. The C and M mice were fed ad libitum, while the F and MF groups underwent alternative-day feed deprivation. The M and MF groups mice were supplemented with melatonin at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight by drinking.  Correlation Analysis of Phenotype, Bacteria, and Metabolites  We analyzed correlations between the phenotype and the differences of gut microbita or metabolome (Supplementary Figure 5A). Serum glucose and TC levels were positively correlated with the Prevotella abundance.",2b78d5f3-d8f0-47a6-a319-3af563a279fd
31,results22," The epididymal fat mass and serum glucose level were negatively correlated with the metabolites alanine, isoleucine and methionine.  We also analyzed correlations between differential bacteria (genus) and metabolites (Supplementary Figure 5B). Bacteria from genera Lactobacillus, Olsenella, Desulfovibrio, and Parvibacter were positively correlated with the metabolites ribose, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and the amino acids methionine, alanine, isoleucine and valine. However, these metabolites were negatively correlated with the genera Prevotella, Parasutterella, Parabacteroides, Helicobacter, Paraprevotella, Barnesiella, and Vampirovibrio.

32,discussion0," In this study, IF significantly reduced BW of mice, although there was no significant difference in cumulative food intake. IF reduced BW, fat mass, and caloric intake in a manner comparable with a low fat diet (8), suggesting that IF reduces the BW of both obese and normal hosts. A study on IF in obese patients found that weight loss occurs over several weeks because, despite overeating on refeeding days, individuals do not fully compensate for the calorie-deficit realized on fasting days (34). This was similar to what was recorded in our mice model after 24 h of fasting. These effects were in part due to the shift from the utilization of glucose to fatty acids and ketones as the body's preferred fuel source during fasting (35). As shown in this study, fasting groups (F and MF) had a significantly lower serum glucose level, ribose level, and intestinal glucose abundance but significantly higher gut 2-ketoadipate abundance than the C and M groups.",b95933fe-a7cf-446a-82a3-93d5f22a120b
33,discussion1," Food and water intake in mice seems to follow a pattern of small, frequent meals associated with drinking (36). When the mice were deprived of food on fasting days, they drank significantly less water as well (37). As a result, water intake fluctuated with food intake during fasting.  The morphologic observations of eWAT in the present work demonstrated that fasting resulted in reduced adipocyte area. The number of multilobular adipocytes was significant increased by IF, which is a typical characteristic of beige adipocytes. These results indicate that eWAT browning occurs during fasting. This is consistent with previous reports that found that fasting caused WAT browning in mice, and that IF increased energy expenditure through non-shivering thermogenesis (38). Melatonin was found to directly regulates energy consumption by activating brown adipose tissue and participating in the browning process of WAT (39).",5bd087dd-7cc0-40ab-a2e0-36e82405bb0e
34,discussion2," Melatonin had a significant effect on the number of adipocytes per square millimeter in the present work, but no effect on adipocyte size.  Several studies have shown that melatonin prevents obesity in different animal models (18, 40, 41) and has a protective effect against dietary-induced obesity (18). In this study, oral administration of melatonin through the drinking water improved serum melatonin level but had no effect on body weight gain and serum indexes of mice fed on normal diet. The level of serum melatonin was positively correlated with the abundance of Allobaculum, indicating that the addition of exogenous melatonin may affect the content of Allobaclum in the intestine.  Intestinal morphology can be used to assess intestine function and health (42). The long villi and shallow crypts of the ileum are associated with digestive and absorptive function (43).",1b059b3d-4a43-4e61-8936-9b5e16a18ee9
35,discussion3," In this study, the F group had significantly greater ileal villi length and villi length/crypt depth than the C group, indicating that the ileal villi became longer and the crypts became shallower to enhance the digestive and absorptive capacity of the small intestine in order to adapt to the relative lack of nutrition under fasting conditions.  Fasting was able to induce the accumulation of lipid droplets all over cells (44). Lipid droplets rich in triglycerides are efficiently decomposed in hepatocytes to provide fatty acids for the formation of lipoprotein particles (45). In this study, fasting may lead to the influx of fatty acids from adipose tissue into the liver to a certain extent, thereby increasing the number of lipid droplets in the liver.  Studies on obese mice have shown that the obese microbiome has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the diet (46).",e07e6af0-5dcb-4e90-a9b0-be40f57ecaf1
36,discussion4," The obese mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) had significantly higher Firmicutes but lower Bacteroides relative abundance in caecum (47). In this study, IF changed the gut microbiota, with an increased abundance of Firmicutes but a decreased abundance of Bacteroides, which eventually led to dramatic changes in microbiota composition and an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. It indicated that IF changed the intestinal microbiota of mice and led them similar to obesity, that is to say, IF increased the ability of intestinal microbiota to obtain energy from diet. This finding are consistent with the results of previous study (38). Similar shifts in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in mice were found to be associated with enhanced energy extraction during cold stress and increased glucose uptake in inguinal WAT (48).",8a25b78d-3035-4060-a7ed-f48cf5fb8001
37,discussion5,"  The vast majority of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut is Firmicutes (49), and butyric acid absorbed by the colonic mucosa is the preferred energy source for colonocytes (50). Metabonomic analysis of intestinal contents showed that fasting increased the 3-hydroxybutyric acid and 4-hydroxybutyric acid content, which may correspond with changes in microorganisms.  IF increased the abundance of lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus has the ability to digest nutrients and may have a significant influence on carbohydrate metabolism (51). This study showed that the abundance of intestinal Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with serum glucose level, TC and body weight gain. And the abundance of Lactobacillus was positively correlated with the contents of various metabolites (3-hydroxybutyric acid, ribose, 3, 7, 12-trihydroxycoprostane).",ae095b77-39f4-4ceb-a40d-8625ab0af6ad
38,discussion6," IF induced enrichment of Lactobacilli, which are commonly used as probiotics because of their beneficial effects, including reduction of inflammatory immune responses (52). Akkermansia also increased under fasting conditions in this study. A. muciniphila not only participates in the host immune regulation, but also enhances the integrity of the intestinal epithelial cells and the thickness of the mucus layer, thereby promoting intestinal health (53, 54). In this study, fasting led to a significantly higher abundance of Akkermansia in the gut of mice compared with un-fasting treatment (the C and M group), which indicating that the nutritional supply of the host could affect the growth of A. muciniphila in the intestine. When the host is under the fasting or in malnutrition, A. muciniphila revealing the characteristics of degrading mucin can be defined as a competitive advantage, which was consistent with the experiment on hamsters that the abundance of A.",b650379a-e69b-4146-8e20-084509e8e7a7
39,discussion7," muciniphila significantly increased after fasting (55).  In the metagenomic analysis, the ketone pathway was enhanced in the gut microbiome of IF mice, which suggests that the gut microbiome regulates its own ketone body metabolism during fasting of the host (56). Ketones are the preferred fuel for the brain and body during fasting, so the body prioritizes ketones that are converted from the glycogen decomposition of glucose to fatty acids (57). Fasting increased the abundance of 2-ketoadipate in the intestine in the present work, and metabolites related to the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies were significantly increased. This shift indicates that the body has shifted from lipid synthesis and fat storage to mobilizing fat in the form of free fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones (35). We found that fasting changed the energy intake pattern in mice, which led to changes in metabolism.",53b8d004-40ab-4011-942a-432c47a0729c
40,discussion8," Metabonomic analysis of mice intestinal contents showed that the metabolic changes caused by IF were mainly reflected by the relative levels of sugars, amino acids and fatty acids.  In conclusion, IF reduced BW gain, serum glucose, TC, TG, insulin level, and adipocyte size, then increased the number of adipocyte per square millimeter. IF also resulted in increased ileal villus height to optimize digestion and absorption, thereby modulating the intestinal microbiota and metabolites. Melatonin alone had no effect, and there was little interaction between IF and melatonin except for their effects on adipocyte area and number, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Akkermansia, and the intestinal metabolites alanine, valine and isoleucine. These results indicate that IF may alter metabolism, reduce obesity and improve intestinal health.
