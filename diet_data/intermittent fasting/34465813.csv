0,background0," Fasting has been widely used to improve various metabolic diseases in humans. Adaptive fasting is necessary for metabolic adaptation during prolonged fasting, which could overcome the great advantages of short-term fasting. The liver is the main organ responsible for energy metabolism and metabolic homeostasis. To date, we lack literature that describes the physiologically relevant adaptations of the liver during prolonged fasting and refeeding. For that reason, this study aims to evaluate the response of the liver of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to prolonged fasting and refeeding. ",3f3fa5d3-ee5a-4bfb-b8a7-a99d8abe94c9
1,methods0," Sixty-six male SD rats were divided into the fasting groups, which were fasted for 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 h, and the refeeding groups, which were refed for 1, 3, or 6 days after 96 h of fasting. Serum glucose, TG, FFA, β-hydroxybutyrate, insulin, glucagon, leptin, adiponectin and FGF21 levels were assessed. The glucose content, phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity, TG concentration and FFA content were measured in liver tissue, and the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis (phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6Pase), ketogenesis (PPARα, CPT-1a and HMGCS2) and the protein expression of nutrient-sensing signaling molecules (AMPK, mTOR and SIRT1) were determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively.

3,results0," Body weight (BW) changes  All the rats had free physical activity and were alive throughout the fasting period. BW was recorded on the day of detection and is shown in Fig. 1. BW presented significant alterations at the different fasting time points, with losses of 6% at 4 h (n = 6), 5.3% at 8 h (n = 6), 7.8% at 12 h (n = 6), 15.3% at 24 h (n = 6), 18.7% at 48 h (n = 6), 25.5% at 72 h (n = 6), and 28.8% at 96 h (n = 6) compared with BW before food deprivation. Refeeding quickly restored the BW with a significant increase after 1 day of refeeding (n = 6), followed by continued growth in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Over the 6 days of refeeding (n = 6), BW increased by 64.7% when compared with the 4-day fasting BW and was almost similar to the control group.

Serum metabolites in response to fasting and refeeding duration  The blood parameters of glucose, TG, FFAs, and β-hydroxybutyrate under fasting (n = 6 in each group) and refeeding conditions (n = 6 in each group) are summarized in Fig. 2. Blood glucose concentrations continued to decrease from 127.41 ± 8.78 mg/dl before fasting to the lowest level of 79.67 ± 4.46 mg/dl after 24 h of fasting and then slightly increased at 48 h and 96 h (Fig. 2A). At the end of the fasting experiment, the blood glucose exhibited an overall decrease of 29.9% compared with the baseline.",c55ace4b-a3e4-46ee-8d13-63ec2e770568

Serum TG (Fig. 2B) increased from 136.17 ± 32.92 mg/dL before fasting to 245.17 ± 45.73 mg/dL after 4 h of fasting and then markedly declined until the end of fasting. One day of refeeding increased serum TG from 16.0 ± 3.78 mg/dL after 96 h of fasting to 109 ± 28.08 mg/dL, but it was slightly decreased with additional refeeding time. In accordance with the increased lipolysis of adipose tissue, circulating FFAs (Fig. 2C) dramatically increased from 0.61 ± 0.14 µmol/L to 0.72 ± 0.11 µmol/L at 4 h of food deprivation, reached their peak value at 48 h (1.52 ± 0.22 µmol/L), and then slightly declined at 72 h and 96 h (1.1 ± 0.1 µmol/L and 0.86 ± 0.07 µmol/L, respectively).",260b0e4f-96ea-4624-87cc-5b4aec0f3c6c
6,results3," Refeeding quickly recovered the serum FFA levels to baseline, and they were significantly lower after 3 and 6 days of refeeding. The serum FFA mostly originated from the adipose tissue, so we also measured the contents of FFA in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. In visceral adipose, FFA concentration increased from 1.67 ± 0.15 µmol/g to 1.83 ± 0.13 µmol/g after 4 h of fasting (Fig. S2A). It continued to increase in the subsequent fasting period, reached its highest at 24 h (2.17 ± 0.13 µmol/g), then visceral FFA began to decline from 48 h to 96 h of fasting. Refeeding reversed the trends of decline, and it returned to the base line level after 3 days of refeeding. Similar to visceral, the content of FFA in subcutaneous adipose tissue quickly increased from 1.57 ± 0.15 µmol/g to 1.73 ± 0.19 µmol/g after 4 h of fasting, and significantly increased at 8 h of fasting (1.97 ± 0.18 µmol/g, p < 0.01).",306fa2c4-bed2-41f8-a031-e5e47b469f38

On the contrary, serum glucagon increased from 30.37 ± 4.08 mU/L to 33.11 ± 3.53 mU/L after 4 h of fasting, and reaching the highest level at 24 h (41.55 ± 2.98 mU/L). It remained at a high level until 48 h of fasting, then declined at 48 h and 96 h (Fig. 3B). The glucagon/insulin molar ratio increased after 4 h of fasting and reached to the highest level at 48 h of fasting, then it remained at high level until 96 h of fasting (Fig. 3C). Serum leptin also notably decreased within 4 h of fasting, reaching the lowest level at 12 h (0.38 ± 0.02 ng/mL), then slightly elevated at 24 h and 48 h (0.59 ± 0.08 ng/mL and 0.61 ± 0.07 ng/mL, respectively), and remained at 0.59 ± 0.03 ng/mL after 96 h of fasting (Fig. 3D).

Serum insulin recovered from 2.78 ± 0.49 mU/L to 3.79 ± 0.63 mU/L after 1 day of refeeding and continued to increase at 3 days and 6 days of refeeding (Fig. 3A). Serum glucagon still remained at a high level after 1 day of refeeding, and restored to its baseline level after 6 days of refeeding (Fig. 3B). The glucagon/insulin molar ratio returned to the base line level after 3 days of refeeding and remained at base line level after 6 days of refeeding (Fig. 3C). Similar changes were also found for serum leptin, but the response was different for serum adiponectin, which was significantly decreased from 3.7 ± 0.28 µg/mL to 2.96 ± 0.25 µg/mL after 1 day of refeeding and remained at low levels after 6 days of refeeding when compared with the baseline value. Fasting increased serum FGF21 beginning at 12 h (31.67 ± 2.67 pg/mL), reached its highest level at 72 h (40.94 ± 4.2 pg/mL), and then markedly decreased to 21.78 ± 5.",abaf0fe4-cb70-46ab-a76e-4632aadd324a

The content of leptin in subcutaneous had no change till 8 h of fasting, and began to decline from 12 h of fasting and reached the lowest level after 72 h of fasting (Fig. S2D). It returned to the base line level after 1 day of refeeding and remained at base line level after 6 days of refeeding. No significant changes were observed of adiponectin in visceral during the fasting and refeeding period (Fig. S2E).

When glucose reached its minimum, ketone bodies serve as the main energy sources for tissues in the mid-phase of prolonged fasting.

27,discussion0," Mammals have developed multiple mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes, such as food availability (Newman & Verdin, 2017). As the central organ in the regulation of metabolism, the liver plays an irreplaceable role in maintaining energy and nutrient stability during starvation and refeeding. Moreover, the liver is subjected to various nutrient stresses (Trefts, Gannon & Wasserman, 2017). Here, we showed the detailed timing of the metabolic response to 4-day complete prolonged fasting and refeeding. Metabolism-related indicators and pathways were evaluated, including glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, β-oxidation, ketogenesis, hormonal parameters, and nutrient signaling molecules. Fasting quickly consumed glycogen, triggered the energy substrates to shift from glucose to ketones, and induced a series of serum hormone level changes and molecular expression changes in the liver. Furthermore, short-term refeeding reversed most of the existing energy switches.",860dc03e-2740-478b-a35d-e5a3d5b86557
28,discussion1,"  Usually, glycogen is the main source of serum glucose during the initial stage of food deprivation. Hepatic glycogen significantly decreased within 4 h of fasting and was almost fully exhausted by 24 h, corresponding to a maximal serum glucose drop at 24 h of fasting (Fig. 2). Thereafter, gluconeogenesis was the primary source of endogenous glucose production after hepatic glycogen was depleted. When the fasting duration exceeded 12 h, the mRNA and protein expression levels of the gluconeogenesis rate-limiting enzymes phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6Pase increased and reached their highest levels at 24 h of fasting and remained at a high level from 24 h to 48 h of fasting (Fig. 5). Similarly, the same expression pattern was also observed for phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that gluconeogenesis became the leading source for glucose homeostasis.",cf19ad2d-b1f8-4fc2-a7ce-569c47db1770
29,discussion2," Our results agreed with Goldstein & Curnow’s (1978) report, which depicted that fasting induced parallel changes in plasma glucose and hepatic glycogen concentrations with decreases by 24 h. Hepatic glycogen was almost exhausted from 72 h to 96 h of fasting; blood glucose level was little elevated than that in 24 h of fasting. At the same time, the mRNA and protein expression levels of liver gluconeogenesis reduced. But the mRNA expression levels of phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6Pase in the kidney were significantly increased (data not shown), so the raised blood glucose might be contributed by the kidney gluconeogenesis. Hepatic glycogen significantly increased after 1 day of refeeding and was restored to the baseline level by 3 days of refeeding.",061fa978-e8a3-4f51-b62a-39e221901003
30,discussion3," At the same time, a decrease in G6Pase and phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA and protein was observed, which indicated that the switch from gluconeogenesis to glycolysis may completely occur within 1 day following refeeding. In contrast, some other research has observed different results in mice with short-term fasting and refeeding. In that study, hepatic glycolysis remained low during the initial refeeding phase, while gluconeogenesis remained active until hepatic glycogen levels were restored (Bulik, Holzhütter & Berndt, 2016). The difference in the results between these two studies was mainly caused by different refeeding periods. This finding also indicated that hepatic glycogen played a central role in maintaining short-term glucose homeostasis during transitions between the fed and fasted state .",a9b1f097-3169-43e5-99ff-86dd1f4daccc
31,discussion4,"  When the liver glycogen was exhausted, lipolysis served as the primary energy source for other tissues, corresponding with the decrease in insulin during prolonged fasting (Lessan & Ali, 2019). Lipolysis was the process by which TGs were hydrolyzed to FFA and glycerol. A transient increase in blood TG occurred at 4 h of fasting, followed by a cliff-like decline (Fig. 2B). However, a marked reduction in hepatic TG was found after 4 h of fasting that reached a minimal value at 24 h. These results were in agreement with the findings of others (Groener & Van Golde, 1977; Herrera & Freinkel, 1968). The blood TG level remained at a lower level after 6 days of refeeding and was slightly higher than that after 96 h of fasting. Nevertheless, hepatic TG rapidly increased after refeeding and was restored to the prefasting level after 3 days of refeeding.",02f9f099-c5f1-4e3f-92a7-ae41d70d2115
32,discussion5," These results implied that the hydrolysis of TG was triggered in the initial stage of fasting, and the constant consumption led to a continuous decline in serum TG levels. Stimulation of lipolysis resulted in a profound increase in FFA release from adipose tissue. In line with the enhanced lipolysis, circulating and hepatic FFA flux and serum β-hydroxybutyrate increased to the highest levels from 24 h to 72 h of fasting. However, lipolysis did not decrease the FFA flux in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and it also increased with the fasting duration, and declined at 48 h and 96 h. These results might cause by FFA cycling, which could reesterificate most FFA back into adipose triglycerides before FFA release into plasma in response to metabolic demands . Previous studies have proven that overexpression of CPT-1a or HMGCS2 increased hepatic β-oxidation and ketone synthesis (Geisler et al., 2019; Gwon et al.",95aa8ae4-c47b-4dc0-a81a-0a6c896ab644
33,discussion6,", 2020), while HMGCS2 knockdown eliminated the fasting-induced rise in serum β-hydroxybutyrate . In the present study, the mRNA and protein expression of CPT-1a increased by 1.5 times after 12 h of fasting, while that of HMGCS2 rose from 8 h of fasting until 72 h and then slightly decreased after 96 h of fasting. Thus, maximal changes in mRNA expression induced by fasting might be achieved within 24 h in the rat. According to the hepatic glycogen concentration, the robust elevation of metabolites and the expression of related genes represented a complete induction of the fasting response within 24 h in the rat. FFA flux and triglycerides were significantly decreased within 72 h of fasting and most of metabolism indicators declined to a low level. These subsequent alterations revealed the fuel substrate shift process and indicated that three days of fasting was essential for the metabolic pattern shift induced by fasting.",23c08269-02e3-4acf-ad6a-dcb7a9702b86
34,discussion7,"  A previous study proved that several transcription factors control the expression of gluconeogenic, oxidative, and ketogenic enzymes. PPARα plays an essential role in the metabolic adaptation of the liver to fasting situations (Preidis, Kim & Moore, 2017). In this study, the mRNA expression of PPARα in the liver was markedly increased after 8 h of fasting. This change occurred after serum FFA levels increased and circulating insulin levels decreased in response to food deprivation. Furthermore, there was a highly positive correlation between the mRNA expression of PPARα and FFA levels (r = 0.758, p < 0.001; Fig. S1A) but a negative correlation with insulin (r = 0.538, p < 0.001; Fig. S1B). In fact, insulin has been demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on PPARα mRNA expression in the liver .",f55f7428-b35f-4d50-aed2-601d6f7a8d91
35,discussion8," Thus, the decrease in insulin could be one of the primary events in the activation of fatty acid oxidation under food deprivation through changes in critical transcription factors in different tissues . PPARα mRNA expression continued to increase out to 48 h ( p < 0.05, Fig. 6A) and then slightly decreased but remained higher than the baseline level. Highly expressed PPARα signaling limited the potential hepatotoxic effects of lipid accumulation by enhancing lipid oxidation and ketone body synthesis. In our study, there was a highly positive correlation between the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1a and HMGCS2 (r = 0.737 and r = 0.791, p < 0.001, respectively; Figs. S1C and S1D). Thus, PPARα appears to be integral for metabolic adaptations with increased ketogenesis in response to fasting.",628f6d3c-73b6-4894-bff1-56c7fc77ec75
36,discussion9,"  Metabolism is controlled by the interaction of many hormones under different nutritional conditions, which maintains the energy reserves necessary to maintain a healthy organism. During periods of fasting, insulin, glucagon, leptin, FGF21, and adiponectin play important metabolic roles. The pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon, are critical mediators in coordinating the systemic response to changes in nutritional status, with the liver being a primary site of action. Insulin presented a time-dependent decrease in the rat during the fasting period. It reached the lowest level at 72 h of fasting in the present research, which was consistent with the upregulated gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis due to its suppressive action . Serum glucagon exhibited an opposite trend. It was increased with fasting initiation, and reached to the highest level nearly 48 h of fasting, then it remained at high level till the end of fasting.",2856a711-3af0-4577-8cac-51c54bb6df58
37,discussion10," Previous studies have indicated that glucagon played a critical role in the regulation of hepatic glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation during fasting . The increased serum glucagon in our research proved that the leading to a predominant glucagon signal, which increases hepatic intracellular concentrations of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and downstream PKA and CREB signaling pathways, increasing hepatic glucose output . The serum glucagon/ insulin ratio increased with fasting and decreased upon refeeding were consistent with other research , and further indicated the reciprocal regulation of glucagon and insulin signal to adapt the fasting and refeeding condition. Most of the fasting-induced changes in metabolite and serum hormone levels were reciprocally altered during refeeding.",7a3aa846-ed6e-474f-860d-e85f16c89b7f
38,discussion11," Indeed, we and other authors have observed increases in insulin and decreases in FFA concentrations in refed rats (Kochan, Karbowska & Swierczyński, 1997). Similar to serum insulin, leptin, which regulates energy homeostasis and modulates satiety by suppressing food intake and stimulating energy expenditure (Zieba, Biernat & Barć, 2020), showed a consistent decreasing trend during fasting and refeeding. Moreover, the content of leptin quickly decreased at the beginning of fasting in visceral but not in subcutaneous. These data supported the view that leptin synthesis responded acutely to changes in nutritional status in a site-specific manner. The earlier and more pronounced decrease in leptin content in visceral compared with subcutaneous would be in line with the knowledge that the mobilization of intra-abdominal fat pads is greater than in subcutaneous during fasting .",2adf5f77-1eb4-48c4-a4e1-5e180bfdad1b
39,discussion12," Adiponectin is an adipokine-specific hormone that is mainly secreted by white adipose tissue and is involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism (Nguyen, 2020). Our finding of unaltered serum adiponectin during the fasting and refeeding periods was supported by similar observations in old male rats and mice (Gui, Silha & Murphy, 2004). However, inconsistent of the serum adiponectin in this study, fasting increased the content of adiponectin in subcutaneous, but had no influence on visceral. Similarly, studies in human and rodents had proposed that subcutaneous white adipose tissues were reported to be a major source of adiponectin (Wronska & Kmiec, 2012). Zhang et al. (2002) proved that fasting reduced and refeeding enhanced adiponectin mRNA expression in perirenal adipose tissue of 6-month F344/BN rats, but serum adiponectin was not different from control levels.",73f7115a-b46f-4a43-b41e-bf04fc37926e
40,discussion13," Moreover, fasting in 8-week-old male SD rats for 1 or 4 days did not change the amounts of adiponectin mRNA in subcutaneous or epididymal adipose tissue (Bertile & Raclot, 2004). Thus, posttranscriptional mechanisms might regulate adiponectin release into the blood and cause different results. FGF21 was described as a key liver-secreted hormonal mediator of the adaptive response to starvation and was attributed to driving ketogenesis  and gluconeogenesis  during starvation. Consistent with others’ research, fasting increased serum FGF21 from 48 h to 72 h but significantly decreased it at 96 h of fasting. This changing trend was similar to that of the mRNA expression of the transcription factor PPARα, which was shown to regulate FGF21 . However, the fasting and refeeding-induced changes in plasma hormone concentrations were also altered when facing different nutrition conditions.",45de3613-e859-4907-a3c5-b3a5bf131c5e
41,discussion14,"  Additionally, several nutrient-sensing signaling molecules (AMPK, SIRT1, and mTOR) are independently or synergistically regulated by multiple pathophysiological processes, such as cell energy metabolism, autophagy, apoptosis, and cell survival in the liver (Giovannini & Bianchi, 2017). As one of the most critical nutrient-regulating signals, mTOR is activated by serine phosphorylation at ser2448 in high-energy states. In this study, the protein expression of mTOR was not affected by the fasting duration. In contrast, the proportion of p-AMPK (Thr172) to total AMPK presented an increasing trend during 4 days of complete fasting. AMPK is the downstream component of a kinase cascade that acts as a sensor of cellular energy status.",1c2124e2-3c55-46b9-8764-10449217dd3b
42,discussion15," Once activated, phosphorylated AMPK (Thr172) inhibited not only the expression of the gluconeogenesis-related genes phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6Pase but also phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC)), which led to a switch in the energy-producing pathways that functions as a fuel gauge . According to the serum glucose and serum FFA levels, the status of AMPK coordinated energy expenditure by controlling gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis during prolonged fasting. The histone deacetylase SIRT1 plays a critical role in protein deacetylation related to cellular metabolism, stress responses, and possibly aging by modulating the activity of transcription factors and cofactors . SIRT1 functions as a master switch to maintain lipid and glucose homeostasis and energy balance by regulating important metabolic regulators .",22327bc4-d9a9-45ad-9d5e-f0478830ec4b
43,discussion16," Similar to AMPK, the expression of SIRT1 was upregulated at 4 h of fasting and remained at a high level until the end of the 4-day fasting duration. These results suggested that the liver could quickly (after 4 h of fasting in rats in the present study) respond to the alterations in different nutritional environments by activating a series of metabolic pathway reactions after sensing energy changes. The activated status of p-AMPK reached its highest level at the 24-h fasting time point in this rat fasting experiment, which to some extent implied that the liver could produce and maintain a new homeostasis after 24 h of fasting in rats. Besides the nutrient-sensing signaling molecules, the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial redox state and hepatic level of energy charge (EC) also inflects the energy metabolism response to fasting and refeeding. These parameters, to some extent, influence the changes of nutritent-sensing signaling molecules.",3beb4d47-5bda-4b7f-8c07-9d3903f56325
44,discussion17," Previous studies have proven that phosphorylated AMPK (Thr172) is sensitive to cellular AMP/ATP ratio . Adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, and AMP) usually is used to evaluate liver energy charge (Díaz-Muñoz et al., 2000). Start & Newsholme have reported that rats fasted for 24 h show a decrease in hepatic ATP, total adenine nucleotides, and energy charge levels (Start & Newsholme, 1968). Liver energy metabolism is complex, the present research differs from these observations in several aspects. However, comparison between both studies is difficult due to a difference in experimental design. A more comprehensive design is required to fully understand the changes in liver energy sensing factors during fasting and refeeding.",b90f33e6-e3c9-4e61-8c15-2cf09a0303bb
45,discussion18,"  Actually, except the regulatory process of the body’s own homeostasis during fasting-feeding, circadian rhythms also play an important role to allow animals to coordinate behavioral and physiological processes with respect to one another and to synchronize these processes . Previous studies have proved that the blood glucose level, the glycogen concentration, in fed and starved rats displayed rhythmic oscillations with a 24- or 12-hour period in the course of the day, but one day’s fasting or prolonged fasting do not affect the character of circadian rhythm . What’s more, the presence of a food-entrainable oscillator (food entrainable oscillator (FEO)), which is independent from the SCN, is relate to metabolic rhythms . In this research, we concern a more detail fasting duration from 4 h to 96 h, and almost each sacrifice time is on the light time, therefore less affected by circadian rhythms.",e9b69d71-85ca-4601-9acd-bf786a6dfb21
46,discussion19," Despite this, rhythm factor is an important influencing factor of intermittent fasting, so it necessary to be further verified in-depth research.  Given that many of the metabolic pathways are active and serve metabolic roles during prolonged fasting, careful consideration must be applied to study the design of prolonged intermittent fasting regimens.  Conclusions  Taken together, these results show that there were changes in the metabolism of glucose and lipids based on the timing of fasting and refeeding. The results showed that glycogen was an essential source of glucose during 24 h of fasting, while lipids were mobilized during prolonged fasting. A significant energy metabolic substrate switch from glucose to ketone bodies occurred between 24 h and 72 h of fasting. One day of refeeding quickly recovered this metabolic switch after 4 days of fasting. The metabolic activity of the liver is involved in satisfying the energy needs during periods of restricted fasting and feeding.",63e92a17-5f8a-4bd3-b69d-c1f74df91a25
47,discussion20," This research highlights the timing of the metabolic adaptation changes in response to prolonged fasting and refeeding, which may provide a reference for designing a reasonable intermittent fasting interval to prevent adverse effects. However, there are limitations to this study. The detailed series of changes in the different hormones, energy-sensing factors, and blood parameters in response to fasting and refeeding are not fully understood. The relation between circadian systems and fasting and refeeding is lacking and further research with larger samples is necessary to validate the different sequences of changes and circadian fluctuations during prolonged fasting and refeeding.
