Endpoints included subjectively perceived itching on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0–100 mm); disease severity by SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)); and adverse events (AEs).

Study design, setting, and mitigation strategies due to the COVID-19 pandemic  In a four-armed, randomized controlled, single-center, open explorative clinical trial, adult AD patients received hypnotherapy group program (HTP), intermittent fasting with diet adjustment group program (IFDP), EP, or control (nonintervention, waiting list, control). This study followed the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki,38 and the ICH-GCP guidelines.39 The positive decision of the ethics commission at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (EA1/315/19) was obtained and the study was registered prospectively (https://www.drks.de/, DRKS00020557).",d60dfe89-86ba-4211-86e7-e843f0c1c86e

A randomization list was generated by a data manager as a computer-generated block randomization with variable block length. The randomization list was concealed by use of a computer interface, implemented in an MS ACCESS database and managed by the study nurse. The study physician contacted the study nurse by telephone, and after entering participants' inclusion information, participants were assigned to the respective study arm, and randomization results were reported to the study physician.

This study was started at the same time and thus affected by the pandemic-related restrictions. Resulting modifications and mitigations are reported considering the CONSERVE statement (Fig. 1).41 Extenuating circumstances were changing Berlin's pandemic laws and confinements, with strict in-house regulations prohibiting research “in presence” during many months. Impacts as a result included the near-impossible participant recruitment, difficulty in performing physical examination for study inclusion, and “in-presence” endpoint measures or interventions.

Mitigating strategies were the constantly updated COVID-19 hygiene concepts, risk–benefit evaluations, and timing adjustments. As a consequence, at the beginning of the study, enrolled patients could not receive their allocated interventions in time. The authors constantly attempted restarts. In October 2020, these patients were re-evaluated by the study physician, and thereafter started together with newly recruited participants, the (now mostly online) group interventions (October 2020 to February 2021).",f2baf8e1-4b73-4943-8b63-48392c3fd5bb

After passing the foreseen two years for the study project, and with the prospect of renewed stricter research limitations, the study was closed on October 26, 2021.

Group interventions were performed by well-educated and clinically experienced hypnotherapists (a physician and a psychologist), one dietician, or two sports scientists, respectively.

However, the use of hypnotherapy in atopic diseases has only been tested in few exploratory studies, and very rarely within the past 20 years.14–18 Senser et al (2004) randomized 33 adult AD patients to 12 single hypnotherapy sessions á 1 h, or to the nonintervention control.14 Patients allocated to hypnotherapy were reported to show improvements pre–post and in comparison with control patients regarding the severity of AD by SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), subjectively perceived itching intensity (VAS), subjectively perceived skin condition (VAS), and QoL disease-specifically by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).",d3f772e7-f31b-4da2-9d28-26f07f6f4afc
30,discussion4,"14 The authors interpreted that 12 sessions of single hypnotherapy is an effective treatment. This study reported no AE. Earlier trials did not report AEs.59  In contrast, and in addition to minor AEs, in this study there was one AE unsurely related to hypnotherapy group program (HTP) with worsening of symptoms (using a topical immunomodulator). The authors found no other explanation for the individual worsening. However, the possibility of symptom worsening is important for patient information and shared decision-making in hypnotherapy. Delaitre et al performed a retrospective data analysis in 27 AD outpatients (mean age 34.5 years) with symptom persistence despite local AD therapy treated with 2–16 individual hypnotherapy sessions á 20 min. The authors found a reduction in disease severity by Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) (measured by the treating physician) and patients' self-assessments, but reported no AE assessment.",1ddd7f39-cde2-4dde-8152-4ed33166326a

Although they found the medication regimens comparable between groups, they could not correlate endpoints to medication use, and therefore, they cannot exclude that medication regimens could have influenced the clinical endpoints. The authors can draw no conclusions from the one patient allocated to EP, as outcome changes might be by chance as in prospective case reports.

The main limitations were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The change in the trial design (closing one study arm) and the small sample size substantially impair the effectiveness evaluations. However, as this is an exploratory trial, the feasibility of the study interventions could be investigated to a certain extent and the interventions proved practicable, as “in-presence” and as online meetings.  Further study limitations include the monocenter setting and the female predominance, which further limits the generalizability of the results.",342994b2-fcd8-4c34-827a-84f8f7dc2a1b
33,discussion7," The study design had potential sources of bias: Patients performing hypnotherapy group program (HTP), intermittent fasting with diet adjustment group program (IFDP), or EP received more therapist and/or peer group time and attention than control patients, and blinding of patients and therapists was impossible. Consequently, the observed indications for improvements may have been overestimated. Emerging trends should be verified by confirmatory studies. Further studies should consider to use the subjectively perceived itching intensity (VAS) as a primary endpoint, as this is to patients a meaningful and validated measurement.  Even with a modified study design, the study results are meaningful as they provide data and methodology for the group interventions, in presence and online. As patients participated in studies during the COVID-19 pandemic, they think it is ethical to publish the results.",8f41ec9e-bd30-4459-af03-ac789e1aa44c

Conclusion  The study interventions were feasible and acceptable for patients with mild-to-moderate severe AD, however, the recruitment was difficult due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
