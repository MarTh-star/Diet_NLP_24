0,introduction0," Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is the most common chronic liver condition, affecting approximately 25% of the world’s population.1 non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome2 and has the potential for progression towards cirrhosis and liver cancer.3  Currently, there is no approved pharmacological treatment for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although several compounds are under development.4 Instead, lifestyle changes leading to weight reduction are considered first-line treatment.5 Weight reduction has the potential to reverse steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)), and liver fibrosis.6 Some evidence suggests that diet modifications are more feasible than exercise and lifestyle changes are generally more available than bariatric surgery.",2d02d398-0ae9-4d57-95b5-14701b7ef81c
1,introduction1,"7  It is unclear whether any specific diet should be recommended to non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients to achieve a reduction of liver fat. Recent guidelines for the treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) recommend a pragmatic and individualised approach and do not advocate for any specific diet. However, a macronutrient composition adjusted to the Mediterranean diet is suggested.8  Over the past decades, low-carbohydrate diets (low-CHO) have gained popularity. One example is the low-carb high-fat diet (low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet) which has the potential for reducing body weight and insulin resistance (IR).[9], [10], [11] However, low carb high fat diet (LCHF) includes a high proportion of dietary fat and may increase serum levels of LDLs.12  Another popular diet regime is intermittent calorie restriction (intermittent calorie restriction (ICR)).",8f8617eb-4034-443f-9834-f6baa6a2c758
2,introduction2," One example of intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) is the 5:2 diet which is based on calorie restriction for 2 non-consecutive days per week. intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) diets may have beneficial effects on body weight and IR.[13], [14], [15] However, despite an increasing interest in intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) diets, little is known about their role as a treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).16  Here, we present the results from a 12-week randomised controlled trial comparing treatment for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with low carb high fat diet (LCHF) and 5:2 diets administered by a dietitian, and standard of care (SoC) recommendations given by a physician. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) was used to measure the reduction of liver steatosis from baseline to end of treatment (EoT). ",7a82888c-20c7-42e9-9c05-aa41dc0b65f0
3,methods0," We conducted an open-label randomised controlled trial that included 74 patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to 12 weeks’ treatment with either a low carb high fat diet (LCHF) or 5:2 diet, or general lifestyle advice from a hepatologist (standard of care; SoC). The primary outcome was reduction of hepatic steatosis as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Secondary outcomes included transient elastography, insulin resistance, blood lipids, and anthropometrics.   Study participants  Participants were recruited from 2 sources: the outpatient clinic at the Department of Hepatology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden and by advertisement in a local newspaper.",83527f36-d8e8-40cc-acf8-66729b2db654
4,methods1," Inclusion criteria were 1 of either: (1) non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosed by radiologic assessment (ultrasound, computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging), (2) Fibroscan® (Echosens, Paris, France) with a controlled attenuation parameter (controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)) >280 dB/m in combination with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or (3) controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) >280 and elevated alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)) (>46 IU/L for women, >66 IU/L for men) and overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2).  Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1. No participant was exposed to vitamin E or steatogenic medications such as steroids. At inclusion, in total 16 participants were on treatment with statins which have a potentially beneficial effect on the liver (5:2 n = 7; low carb high fat diet (LCHF) n = 5; SoC n = 4).",4cd88c58-22ff-4703-8ad1-f41394d2f6bb
5,methods2," All participants provided written informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Stockholm, Sweden (Dnr 2017/258-31) and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03118310). All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript.Fig. 1 Flowchart of screening and inclusion of participants.  Study protocol  Participants entered a 12-week intervention with either the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet, 5:2 diet, or SoC. At randomisation, a comprehensive physical assessment was undertaken (see Supplementary material). Participants were asked to quantify the level (min/week) of physical activity in a questionnaire. They were instructed not to start any dietary supplements during the intervention. At the final visit, all measures mentioned above were re-collected.  Diet intervention  Participants were randomised in blocks of 3 in a 1:1:1 ratio by randomly drawing sealed envelopes.",b8412f52-992e-4bde-87fb-355f670f7f8a
6,methods3," The allocation sequence was concealed to the participants and to all investigators. A specialist dietitian (CL) administered diet-specific advice to participants in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) and 5:2 groups separately, as described below, and participants were provided written materials and diet-specific cookbooks. To support adherence to the respective diets, participants randomised to the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) or 5:2 diet were followed up by phone at weeks 2, 4, and 8 and a visit to the dietitian was scheduled at week 6. A detailed self-reported 3-day food diary was used to estimate the dietary intake at baseline and also to monitor adherence to diet and calculate the intake of macronutrients at week 6 and 12 of the intervention. To compare groups the intake for the 5:2 group for fasting and non-fasting days was weighted by a factor of 2 and 5, respectively, to give nutrient intake over the entire week and then reported as a daily mean.",07d120fb-a38b-44cd-af07-e6ec26af33a2
7,methods4," Additionally, adherence was also evaluated with a 24-h dietary recall17 during telephone follow up at week 2, 4, and 8 (Fig. S1).  Participants assigned to SoC treatment had an individual consultation with a hepatologist at the start of intervention. During the follow-up, they were instructed to contact the hepatologist for study-related questions by telephone or E-mail. For the SoC-group, the self-reported 3-day food diary was collected at baseline and at week 12 (Fig. S1). Thus, the SoC group served as a placebo-treatment and they were therefore not continuously in contact with the dietitian during the intervention.  The 5:2 diet  On 2 non-consecutive days per week, participants in the 5:2 group were instructed to consume 500 kcal/day for women and 600 kcal/day for men. Recipes were provided with suggestions of meals that would not exceed the calorie restriction.",7daddc5b-50ea-440b-84b8-2f4c2ed8f343
8,methods5," For the remaining 5 days of the week, they received instructions and recipes that followed the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012 (Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012 (NNR)),18 with an intake limit of 2,000 kcal/day for women and 2,400 kcal/day for men. The average daily calorie intake over a week was set to 1,600 kcal/day for women and 1,900 kcal/day for men. The percentage of energy (E%) from different macronutrients in the recipes was 45–60 E% carbohydrates, 25 E% fat and 10–20 E% protein. The macronutrient composition of the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012 (NNR) shares its principles with the Mediterranean diet but is adapted to local products and traditions in the Nordic countries.18  The low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet  Participants were instructed to consume an average daily calorie intake of 1,600 kcal/day for women and 1,900 kcal/day for men. Carbohydrate intake was restricted to a maximum of 10% of the total energy intake.",a767ea73-9658-4a97-a7d1-6b88040b06f5
9,methods6," Moreover, recipes were provided with an energy distribution of 5–10 E% carbohydrates, 50–80 E% fat and 15–40 E% protein. The low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet is based on meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, vegetable oils, and dairy fat. Foods to be avoided included sugar, bread, pasta, rice, pies, potatoes, and fruit.  Standard of care  The SoC group received individualised guidance from a hepatologist on how to choose a healthy diet, to reduce the intake of sweets and saturated fatty acids, increase sources of unsaturated fat, avoid large portions, and to regularly eat 3 meals per day. Each participant was provided a written summary of the dietary advice (see Supplementary material).  Magnetic resonance spectroscopy  Twenty-four to 72 h before randomisation all participants underwent Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).",5cad0bf6-f053-443c-8e27-bb37d89c32a0
10,methods7,"19 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data were analysed using the Java-based magnetic resonance user interface software (JAVA, Sun Microsystems, Menlo Park, California, US)20 and the fat and water peaks were quantified using the advanced method for an accurate and efficient spectral fitting algorithm.21 For a complete description of the Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) method, see the Supplementary material.  Fatty acid composition  In addition to the self-reported data from the food diaries and 24 h recall, samples for detection of plasma total lipid fatty acid composition were collected at baseline, week 6 (for the 5:2 and low carb high fat diet (LCHF) group) and week 12 to estimate the dietary intake of fat as a measure of adherence to the diets (Fig. S1). The method is described in the Supplementary material. ",ef89d7a9-b9a2-4c5c-b8f9-60984385eec4
11,analysis0," An a priori power calculation assumed a 30% relative reduction in liver fat in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) and 5:2 groups vs. a 10% reduction in the SoC arm. With an α of 0.05 and 80% power to detect that effect, at least 16 persons per group were needed. To compensate for drop out, and to be able to detect a smaller difference in effect between the 5:2 and low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diets, the sample size was expanded to 25 persons per group.  The main analyses were done based on the intention-to-treat (intention to treat (ITT)) population and missing data were assumed to be missing at random. All participants randomised to the intervention were included in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis. To estimate pre and post values, as well as changes within and between the diets for the main outcomes, a linear mixed model was used with diet and time, including the interaction term, as fixed effects. In this analysis the participants were included as a random effect.",7644d14b-c3aa-409c-9ab9-e2548f8ea527
12,analysis1," Estimates were presented as least square means. Paired t tests were used to evaluate pre-post differences for all secondary outcomes and data were log-transformed when appropriate.  Two sensitivity analyses were performed. First, sex and Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measure of liver fat fraction (MR fat percent) differed at baseline and were therefore included in the model as adjustment factors. Second, a per-protocol (PP) analysis was carried out. All participants who reported adherence to diet until EoT and who were not lost to follow-up were included in the PP analysis. R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for all analyses. ",9007404f-d54b-4e29-889f-548b985c396d
13,results0," Participants and baseline characteristics  Between September 2017 and January 2020, a total of 74 participants were randomised to the treatment groups. See flowchart for a detailed description of the screening and inclusion of participants (Fig. 1). In total, dropouts were less common in the 5:2 arm (n = 1 [4%]) as compared with the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) arm (n = 5 [20%]), and SoC arm (n = 4 [17%]). Of those who discontinued the treatment, 7 were lost to follow-up. Hence, 64 participants were included in the PP analysis. One participant in the 5:2 group reported a severe adverse event during a fasting day (a fall as a result of hypoglycaemia). See the Supplementary material for reasons for discontinuation and adverse events.  At baseline, all groups were balanced on age, BMI, liver stiffness, waist-to-hip ratio (waist to hip ratio (WHR)), prevalence of T2DM, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood cholesterol levels, and level of physical activity.",81aa5545-d0e2-43a1-bc9a-deea4670391e

Patients in the 5:2 and low carb high fat diet (LCHF) groups significantly reduced HbA1c and HOMA-IR levels. A significant reduction of total serum cholesterol and LDL levels was observed in the 5:2 group but not in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) or SoC groups. In fact, a trend towards higher LDL and a significantly higher HDL was observed in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) group (Table 2).",c9399913-7270-44be-a11a-9b624f3dfbb6
19,results11,"  Adherence to diet  The low carb high fat diet (LCHF) group increased the intake of fat E% by 99% and protein E% by 24% from baseline value while carbohydrate E% decreased by 70%. In the 5:2 group protein E% increased by 16%. Intake of saturated fatty acids significantly increased in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) group, but decreased in the 5:2 and SoC groups (Table 2 and Fig. S2). At the EoT, no difference was observed between the groups in the amount of consumed alcohol.  As a crude measure of total dietary fat intake, the relative levels of linoleic (LA [C18:2n-6]) and α-linolenic acid (ALA [C18:3n-6]) were increased from baseline in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) group but was unchanged in the 5:2 and SoC groups (Fig. S2).

The difference in effect on liver stiffness between the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) and the SoC groups was no longer significant, although a trend was still observed (p = 0.052).  In the PP analysis the reduction of liver fat remained significant in all groups. The change in liver stiffness in the 5:2 and SoC group also remained significant (Table S3).

21,discussion0," In this randomised controlled trial, we found that a dietitian-supported treatment with a low carb high fat diet (LCHF) or 5:2 diet was more effective than SoC in reduction of liver fat after a 12-week treatment. No difference in liver fat reduction was observed between the 5:2 and the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet. Previous studies have reported a correlation between weight loss and reduction of liver fat in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).6 The present results support this correlation and demonstrate that dietary advice can be individualised to achieve short-term weight loss. Individualised dietary counselling may be crucial considering that many person-specific factors affect body metabolism.22 The US National Institute of Health has recently announced that precision nutrition will be a major research strategy between 2020 and 2030.",3b0828b5-0bbd-4c18-a1e7-af0bb9a2f27b
22,discussion1,"23  Although the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet has become popular over the past decade,24 the benefit of a low-CHO diet is controversial. Low-CHO diets, such as the low carb high fat diet (LCHF), have been shown to reduce obesity and IR in patients with T2DM.11,25 Low-CHO diets can be equally or more effective in reducing liver steatosis in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) compared with low-fat or low-calorie diets.26,27 However, the types of dietary lipid consumed may also be of importance in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies have shown that obese people with a high intake of saturated fatty acids develop more steatosis compared with those who consume a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids.28,29 Those findings were not confirmed in our study given that the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet was equally effective as the 5:2 diet in reducing steatosis in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",6e410aba-5b3c-4ca8-a6b1-f94e30c95b1e
23,discussion2," This finding suggests that the hypocaloric context is of greater importance when reversing hepatic steatosis than the macronutrient composition.  intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) diets, such as the 5:2 diet, have gained broad popularity and are promoted in general media.30,31 intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) diets have shown good results in reducing body weight, cardiovascular risk factors, and IR in obese patients.32 To our knowledge, only 2 studies have investigated the efficacy of intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) as a treatment for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with both indicating that intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) can have beneficial effects on liver steatosis.33,34 In one of these the studies33 an 8-week intervention with intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) resulted in the reduction of steatosis and fibrosis as measured by ultrasound and elastography.",0a8c3377-0bbd-4a14-9bc9-657e747829d8
24,discussion3," To our knowledge, no previous study has compared the efficacy of intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) or, more specifically, the 5:2 diet with the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet to treat non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  The reduction of liver fibrosis is a key target of treatment.3 In this study, a significant reduction of liver stiffness was observed in the 5:2 and the SoC groups but not in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) group. Although this observation is noteworthy, we cannot conclude from these results that improved liver stiffness directly translates to a reduction of liver fibrosis. Other causes for changes in elastography measurements, that is the degree of inflammation, cannot be excluded as liver biopsies were not obtained in this study.  A strong correlation exists between LDL levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease.",3a84c95f-9539-48c7-9c6a-6c30ea7222fb
25,discussion4,"35 In this trial, the 5:2 diet resulted in a reduction of LDL levels, whereas in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) group a trend towards higher LDL was noted. This finding is in line with the results of other trials investigating the effect of low carb high fat diet (LCHF) on LDLs.25 non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients often have other risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Longitudinal studies of the natural course of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have shown that cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death.[36], [37], [38] Given these circumstances, low carb high fat diet (LCHF) could be less suited as a treatment for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. However, the present trial was not designed to study blood cholesterol levels specifically, and we also found a significant increase in blood HDL, known to be cardioprotective, in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) arm.",05ac6ab1-200a-4086-a6b5-1a4e8de96c96
26,discussion5," Therefore further research is needed to explore this issue.  Participants in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) group reported more adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal, leading to diet discontinuation. As expected, patients following the 5:2 diet reported hunger and fatigue during fasting days, but few other unforeseen side effects. Fewer participants dropped out of the 5:2 group compared with the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) and SoC groups. This could suggest that the 5:2 diet is easier to adhere to and has less side effects, but that would need to be tested in additional studies.  This study has several strengths. First, it is a prospective randomised controlled trial with well-balanced groups at baseline. Second, a large proportion of the participants completed the study protocol. Third, records of food intake and changes in plasma lipid concentrations suggest good adherence to the diets.",3c9a6156-fca2-42fd-ad86-7236adc6e196
27,discussion6,"39 The outcome measure in our trial, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), is a well-validated and reliable non-invasive method for measuring liver steatosis.40 A few patients had between 3% and 5% hepatic steatosis. Previous studies have however shown that a cut-off level of 3% can be used for detecting steatosis with Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which is why we chose to also include patients with an MR fat percent of 3–5% at baseline.41 The study population is representative of the majority of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, ensuring this study has high external validity and suggests that these diets are appropriate to use at primary care level.  Some limitations should be acknowledged. As this trial was investigating dietary treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) it was designed as an open-label study. In an ideally designed randomised controlled trial the assigned treatment is double-blinded.",0e3e86fe-70e1-43e5-89f4-fcc0b37e75f7
28,discussion7," However, this cannot be accomplished in diet interventions where the exposure is obvious to both the participants and the researchers. The duration of the trial was short (12 weeks). Short-term weight loss can be difficult to maintain over time.42 Our study cannot predict the long-term risk of steatosis recurrence after the intervention. To study this issue future studies should have longer follow-up periods. Despite randomisation, the SoC group was not balanced to the same extent as the 5:2 and low carb high fat diet (LCHF) groups for sex and baseline Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) fat percent. However, a sensitivity analysis adjusting for these factors confirmed the main results.  A 3-day food diary was used to evaluate the diet composition during the trial. When writing a food diary, patients often under-report the total amount of energy.",751586d4-bb88-4f13-ac56-3b5a14eeda16
29,discussion8,"43 Because of this liability, the results indicating that all 3 groups had a hypocaloric diet already at baseline should be interpreted with caution.  Finally, the SoC group did not receive the same guidance by a dietitian as the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) and 5:2 groups. The differences observed in the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) and 5:2 groups compared with the SoC group could be attributable to more frequent consultations during follow-up. However, the primary aim of this trial was to compare the effects of a low-CHO diet and intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) diet with standard of care. The objective of the design of this trial was that the SoC group served as a placebo-treatment. Future studies should evaluate whether the effects of the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) and 5:2 diets can be achieved without comprehensive guidance from a dietitian.",42a0de0d-62ca-4499-a3c5-da38c9dd2a2e
30,discussion9,"  Conclusions  The 5:2 and low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diets were equally effective in reducing liver steatosis, body weight, and measures of IR in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), supporting individual decision-making for patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who want to reduce hepatic steatosis. However, the 5:2 diet also reduced liver stiffness, was tolerated to a higher degree, and had more favourable effects on LDL cholesterol than the low carb high fat diet (LCHF) diet. Given this, the 5:2 diet could possibly be overall more beneficial to patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), especially to those with cardiovascular risk factors.
