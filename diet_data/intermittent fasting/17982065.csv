0,introduction0,"The energy content and frequency of meals are fundamental aspects of nutrition that can have significant effects on the health of laboratory animals. The reduction of energy intake, or caloric restriction (CR), has been shown to increase both the health span and life span of many species, including rats and mice [1]–[3], fruitflies [4], nematodes [5], water fleas, spiders and fish [2]. On the other hand, consuming excessive food and calories leads to obesity and morbidity and increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [6]. Complex neuroendocrine systems control feeding and energy expenditure in mammals; these regulatory systems include cognitive and motivational systems in the brain and hormones produced by endocrine cells and adipose cells [7]–[9]. Many of the physiological effects of reduced energy intake (e.g. reduced fat and muscle mass, reduced body temperature, decreased morbidity and mortality) and dietary energy excess (e.g.",437a7224-5724-4d35-abdd-2df309dc6051
1,introduction1," obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease) are similar in male and female animals. However, there is also evidence that male and female mammals respond differently to alterations in energy intake, both on a neuroendocrine level and on a cognitive level.  In a previous study [10] we demonstrated that a high level of caloric restriction (40% CR) had differential effects upon the physiology and behavior of male and female rats. We demonstrated that there was a beneficial effect of CR (20% CR and 40% CR) upon hippocampus-dependent maze learning in female compared to male rats. Recent findings suggest that higher regions of the brain, including those involved in learning and memory (e.g. hippocampus), influence energy balance and physiological and behavioral responses to varying energy availability [11], [12].",81cede4f-ae7f-4533-b8c4-8baa8920bbe5
2,introduction2," Human subjects that are obese have been shown to perform poorer than normal weight subjects in cognitive tasks [13], [14], whereas the learning and memory ability of patients with anorexia nervosa has been shown to be similar or even superior to that of control subjects [15], [16]. Additionally, animal studies have demonstrated a detrimental effect of excessive energy intake on cognitive performance [17]. There is currently a lack of knowledge of the genetic alterations that occur in the hippocampus as a result of alterations in dietary energy intake. It is also unclear whether any potential hippocampal transcriptome changes are differentially regulated in male and female animals. As we have previously demonstrated that there are significant sex-differences in cognitive performance between calorie restricted male and female rats, we sought to determine whether there would be any gender differences in hippocampal gene regulation in response to dietary energy alterations.",b8154ce9-3cce-4827-89c7-33acd80b3c7d
3,introduction3,"  In this study, we analyzed the hippocampal gene expression profiles of male and female rats that had been maintained for 6 months on either a control diet, a 20% CR diet, a 40% CR diet, an intermittent fasting (IF) diet or a high fat/high glucose diet (high fat/high glucose (HFG)). We identified individual genes, and functional groups of genes that interact with each other in physiological pathways using pathway analyses (PAGE) (Parametric Analysis of Gene Expression; [18]) which uses a systems biology approach to simulate dynamic changes of specific physiological gene pathways in response to intrinsic processes or external simulation. We found that the hippocampi from the female rats on the low energy diets (20% CR, 40% CR, IF) exhibited conserved changes in gene expression, whereas males did not. Additionally, the CR diets significantly increased hippocampal volume in the female rats, but not in the male rats.",987b2088-378f-4c38-8d3c-7e1e42e61cc3

5,methods0,"Animals and diets 47 male and 47 female Sprague-Dawley rats were singly housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle. The following diets were applied to the rats beginning at 4 months of age: control (ad libitum); 20% CR, 40% CR; IF (alternate day fasting); and high fat/high glucose (HFG). Control, CR and IF groups received food pellets that contained 19% protein, 64% carbohydrates, and 17% fat (diet 101845 from Dyets Inc., Bethlehem, PA); this food had a caloric density of 3.774 cal/g and a glycemic load/kg of 442. The high fat/high glucose (HFG) diet (diet 101842 from Dyets Inc.) contained 15% protein, 38% carbohydrates, and 47% fat. The caloric density of the high fat/high glucose (HFG) diet was 4.645 cal/g and its glycemic load/kg was 363.

6,methods1," All procedures were performed in accordance with approved institutional protocols and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute on Aging.  Assessment of ambulatory activity Total activity levels were quantitated using an Omnitech Digiscan open-field activity monitor (Columbus, Ohio, USA) when the rats were 7 months old. Recordings were taken in 4 h intervals (from 7:00 to 10:00 and again from 19.00 until 22.00). Additionally, throughout the study activity levels were also observed and scored by multiple observers at random times during the day. Using the latter semi-quantitative scoring system of general activity, it became apparent that only the 40% CR animals and IF animals showed increased daytime activity. The rat activity levels were therefore formally measured (using the Omnitech apparatus) at one time-point during this study, as our observations showed that animal activity levels did not change throughout the study.",a1ae5ffb-4e98-4846-8cb5-5cc75b921b0d
7,methods2,"  Tissue and plasma collection At 8 months of age, overnight-fasted rats were sedated with isoflurane and blood samples were collected from the tail vein to EDTA-heparinized centrifuge tubes. The blood was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C; plasma was aspirated and was stored at −80°C. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized using isoflurane anaesthesia followed by decapitation. Upon euthanasia, the brain was carefully dissected to obtain the hippocampus. Tissues were flash frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until further analyses.  ELISA analyses Plasma levels of the following hormones were measured according to the manufacturers' instructions using proprietary ELISA kits from the specified companies: leptin (ELISA-Linco), insulin (ELISA-Linco).

9,methods4," Two microliters of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, CA) was then added followed by incubation at 42°C for 35 min. One additional microliter of reverse transcriptase was added, followed by another 35 minute incubation. At the end of incubation, 5 µl of 0.5 M EDTA was added to chelate divalent cations. After addition of 10 µl of 1.0 M NaOH, the samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 min to hydrolyze the remaining RNA. Following the addition of 25 µl of 1 M Tris (pH 8.0), the samples were purified using Bio-Rad 6 purification columns (Hercules, CA). cDNA microarrays were pre-hybridized in a 4 ml hybridization buffer containing 3.2 ml Microhyb (Research Genetics, AL) and 0.8 ml 50% dextran sulfate, 10 µl of 10 mg/ml denatured human Cot 1 DNA (Life Technologies) and 10 µl of 8 mg/ml denatured poly(dA) (Pharmacia, NJ).",d2ee5f80-7ea4-4a7d-9e46-5f5d8e5ee1a9

Hybridized arrays were washed in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS once at room temperature followed by two washes in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 15 min each.  Scanning and quantification The microarrays were exposed to phosphorimager screens for 3 days. The screens were then scanned in a Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) at 50 µm resolution. Quantification of scanned screens was performed with ArrayPro software.  Z-scores and z-ratio Raw hybridization intensity data were log-transformed and normalized to yield z-scores, which in turn were used to calculate a z-ratio value for each gene with respect to the control tissues.",303f4324-4c77-4db6-94d6-7b53fa16f502

Z-ratio values ≥+2.0 or ≤−2.0 were chosen as cut-off values, defining increased and decreased expression, respectively.  Filtering and cluster analysis DIANE (NIH) software was used to filter the 17,000 genes. We filtered out genes which did not vary at least 1.25-fold from the log of the mean of the first filter in at least 60% of the genes expressed (p<0.01). Genes were clustered and sub-clusters were generated using DIANE software.

14,results0,"Body weight and hippocampal weight responses to dietary energy restriction and excess Four-month-old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five diet groups: control (ad libitum), 20% CR, 40% CR, IF and high fat/high glucose (HFG) (8–15 animals per group; Fig. 1A). The rats in the first four diet groups were fed a diet with a typical composition in which the majority of calories were from complex carbohydrates, whereas the high fat/high glucose (HFG) diet contained higher amounts of fat and glucose (Fig. 1B). Rats were maintained on the diets for 6 months and when they were 7 months old, general activity was measured and at 8 months of age, a blood sample was collected from each rat.

16,results2," The increase in body weight was significantly greater in the male rats on the control and high fat/high glucose (HFG) diets, compared with the increases observed in the female rats (Fig. 2A,B). Whereas males on the high fat/high glucose (HFG) diet showed a greater increase in weight than those on the control diet, females on high fat/high glucose (HFG) and control diets gained similar amounts of weight. Males and females exhibited similar body weight responses to 20% CR and IF diets (i.e. a small increase in body weight). Both male and female rats responded to 40% CR by losing a significant amount of body weight during the study. In addition to measuring total body weight for each rat in the different dietary groups, we measured the weight of the left hippocampus at necropsy and normalized the hippocampal weight to the terminal body weights of rats in the same diet group (Fig. 2C).",b83b99e9-8267-407a-8cab-59d916987728
17,results3," The male rats on the three energy restricted diets (20% CR, 40% CR, and IF) showed only minimal increases in hippocampal weight compared to ad libitum controls. Females on all three of the energy restricted diets showed a considerably greater increase in hippocampal weight than the males (Fig. 2C). This increase in hippocampal mass was statistically significant in the female rats that were subjected to 20% CR or 40% CR. In our previous study [10] we found that 20% CR and 40% CR female rats made significantly less errors in a 14-Unit T maze than ad libitum fed control male and female rats.

19,results5,"  Dietary energy restriction affects male and female rats similarly with respect to appetite control and glycemia As the males and females responded differently to the diets with respect to hippocampal size, we decided to assess whether this discrepancy could be related to differences in appetite perception of the animals. If the males are less sensitive to dietary changes with respect to their appetite, then they may not need to alter their behavior, which then subsequently results in alterations in hippocampal size. Circulating levels of leptin, insulin, and glucose were measured in the male and female rats at the 4 month on-diet time point (Fig. 3A–C). Leptin, the body's satiety hormone, acts as an energy regulator, decreasing appetite and increasing metabolism. Leptin levels in male and female rats were significantly lowered in response to the 20% CR, 40% CR, and IF diets (p<0.001, female 20% CR, 40% CR, and IF; p<0.01, male 40% CR; p<0.",3ca207b9-05d5-4e85-ba6a-b37cc46f771e

As expected, circulating leptin levels were decreased in response to dietary energy restriction with both the male and female 40% CR groups having the lowest leptin levels compared to ad libitum controls. These results suggest that both males and females may have the same hunger perception, and changes in their hippocampus are therefore not due to the males not perceiving less dietary energy intake. Neither males nor females on the high fat/high glucose (HFG) diet showed a significant alteration in plasma leptin levels, but there was a trend towards increased leptin levels in both groups (Fig. 3A). Plasma insulin levels tended toward being lower in males and females on the 40% CR diets, although the reduction reached statistical significance only in females on the 40% CR diet (Fig. 3B). Fasting plasma glucose concentrations (Fig.",5d60d684-3eb5-433d-9b2c-4ced9e822082

Additionally, in the females the general activity during the day-time testing period was doubled in response to the IF diet, whereas the IF diet did not affect the general activity levels in the males.

41,results27," Further underlining the lack of a coherent genetic response in the males to energy intake, is that only 2 of the 6 pathways affected by energy restriction were regulated in a coherent manner. It is interesting to note that in complete contrast to the males, the female genetic pathway response was largely dependent upon the level of energy intake. In the females, 23 of a total of 41 significantly altered hippocampal gene pathways were energy restriction-specific. It was striking that for the 23 CR-dependent pathways, and the 18 CR-independent pathways, 100% of the pathways were coherent between diets, meaning that common, significantly altered pathways in the female hippocampi were always altered in the same direction (Fig. 14). This would suggest that, compared to the genetic pathway response of male hippocampi, female hippocampal gene pathway responses are highly organized, especially with respect to caloric restriction.",f8b67c56-c74b-497f-b7ec-00d5fa6ab905
42,results28," This specific energy-dependent gene pathway organizational response could possibly stem from an evolutionary mechanism to allow females to be well equipped to adequately respond to times of dietary energy scarcity (or excess), so that they could remain fertile and have adequate energy stores to rear their offspring.  10.1371/journal.pone.0002398.g013Figure 13 Males respond in an energy intake independent manner to dietary restriction and excess.

Specificity of common pathway regulation Cluster analysis of the low energy diets only, and any low energy diet with high fat/high glucose (HFG) common pathways, revealed that certain dietary group combinations showed greater numbers of modulated pathways. As shown in Fig. 15 we have grouped the number of significantly modulated pathways (modulated significantly in at least two or more different dietary paradigms) for all the dietary combinations in which pathway commonalities were seen.",18f3ad7a-be92-4bc3-bfed-c87e63f87a8c
45,results31," Therefore Fig. 15 represents the multi-dietary group combinations that showed either the greatest or least coherency of physiological pathway regulation. It is important to note that for males the non-CR-specific dietary regime combination with the greatest number of coherently regulated pathways was the 40% CR-high fat/high glucose (HFG) cluster (i.e. highest dietary stress conditions). The female dietary combinations that showed the greatest degree of pathway coherency were the two diets that possess the closest parity in actual input calories, i.e. 20% CR and IF [10]. This is an important finding considering the functional differences between these two dietary paradigms. It seems therefore that female hippocampal gene regulation is considerably more sensitive to reduced energy intake compared to males.",71faa925-ba74-43e9-b9e0-60a6846b62a1
46,results32,"  To directly contrast the gender differences in hippocampal gene responses to energy restriction we have summarized the hippocampal gene pathways that were differentially regulated in the males and females on the same diets (Fig. 16). The divergent responses of the hippocampal transcriptome in response to identical diets provides a further indication of the gender differences in ‘pre-programmed’ hippocampal gene responses to energy restriction or excess. Some of the prominent functional groups of differentially regulated genes in males and females code for proteins that are involved in energy metabolism and glycolysis, dendritic function and regulation, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. In the females on 20% CR the major functional gene pathway that was significantly up-regulated was the glycolysis pathway. Interestingly, this same pathway was down-regulated in the males on 20% CR, reinforcing a strong gender bias of hippocampal regulation in response to reduced energy availability.

47,discussion0,"In the present manuscript, we have demonstrated that there are gender-dependent alterations in hippocampal gene regulation in response to perturbations in dietary energy intake. Hippocampal gene regulation in the female rats was highly conserved between all the energy restricted diets (20% CR, 40% CR, IF), and 70% of multi-diet common genes that were significantly altered (up-regulated or down-regulated) were energy deprivation-specific. In the males, we observed a different phenomenon, as hippocampal gene regulation was not conserved among the energy restricted diets, and none of the multi-diet common genes that were significantly altered were energy deprivation-specific. Interestingly, in the male rats, the only common multi-diet genes that were significantly altered were between the lowest energy (40% CR) and the highest energy (high fat/high glucose (HFG)) diet regimes.",01455dfe-5771-4b5d-98eb-90a7bcb16ae9
48,discussion1," This suggests that female hippocampal gene regulation is calorie-specific and is very sensitive to varying degrees of dietary energy intake. Male hippocampal gene regulation on the other hand, was not calorie-specific as there were no multi-diet common genes that were energy level-specific. However, as there was a 100% coherence between the lowest energy diet (40% CR) and the highest energy diet (high fat/high glucose (HFG)), i.e. the two most extreme diets, this could suggest that in the males there was a coherent stress response. This phenomenon in males could potentially be elucidated in future studies by exposing the male and female animals to additional stressors that could alter the performance in females more than males and change cognitive performance and or/strategies on other special tasks, such as the Morris Water Maze.",0c18c89f-60be-4907-bd78-3c94ab644463
49,discussion2,"  The functional gene pathway analyses (pathway analyses (PAGE)) demonstrated that, in the females, there were 23 significantly altered coherent pathways that were energy deprivation-specific and 18 significantly altered coherent gene pathways that were non-specific. Females responded most coherently to mild caloric reductions (20% CR and IF diets). Interestingly, in the male hippocampi, we observed an entirely opposite phenomenon to the female hippocampi. The hippocampi from the male rats on the low energy diets (20% CR, 40% CR and IF) showed no conserved gene alterations, as 100% of the multi-diet common genes were not specific for reduced energy intake. However, it is interesting to note that there were common gene alterations between the very low energy diet (40% CR) and the very high energy (high fat/high glucose (HFG)) diet in the male rats.",b51e1982-e3c9-4a8c-9db5-8c500664cedc
50,discussion3," The functional gene pathway analyses performed on the male hippocampi showed that only 6 significantly altered coherent gene pathways were energy deprivation-specific and 21 significantly altered coherent gene pathways were not specific for reduced energy intake. Therefore not only at the gene level, but also at the pathway level, there is a similarity in response of the animals, in that female rats have a selective and largely energy intake-specific genetic/pathway response while the male rats only show commonalities in their genetic/pathway response when extreme dietary perturbations are introduced. These genetic responses therefore may serve to enhance cognitive function and facilitate the females' ability to find and secure food. Additionally, it is possible that the coherence in energy restriction for females could also benefit males from an evolutionary perspective.",a1451fdf-f621-4295-b87e-87a415287c0d
51,discussion4," One could argue that the coherence in energy restriction for females could also benefit males from an evolutionary perspective, thus leaving the impression of a dysfunctional pattern in males possibly related to an exaggerated stress response.  Total activity levels were measured when the rats were 7 months old in the ad libitum control, 40% and IF diet groups. The female rats on the 40% CR diet significantly increased their total daytime activity, more so than the 40% CR male rats. This increased ambulatory activity and heightened cognitive ability [10] that we have demonstrated in female rats on a 40% CR diet is consistent with a scenario in which food scarcity imposes a stress on the animal, motivating them to seek food elsewhere.",d69f8298-bbb1-49bc-9590-e2fc66d46c58
52,discussion5," This may be particularly important in female mammals, in contrast to males, because they must ensure that they obtain a sufficient amount of energy to not only support their own survival and fecundity but also the survival and development of their offspring. Diverting any available energy to neuromuscular and cognitive activity would be expected to increase the probability of survival of these females during times when food is scarce. Energy regulating hormones and appetite hormones were, as expected, significantly altered in both the male and female calorie restricted animals.  Circulating levels of leptin were significantly reduced in all rats on reduced energy diets, and the females on the 40% CR diet showed decreased levels of insulin and glucose. This effect is a well-established effect of caloric restriction, which is known to cause decreases in circulating glucose levels and increased insulin sensitivity.",8d415fe0-b075-449c-9848-57eba09c86a7
53,discussion6," It is interesting to note therefore that there may be an evolutionarily-conserved mechanism by which females specifically change their behavior and cognitive capacity in relation to available food. The presence of this heightened sensitivity to low energy intake in females may partly be responsible for the higher prevalence of anorexia nervosa (AN) in females compared to males [20]. Thus when food intake is restricted, either through the environment or voluntarily, only the female will induce a coherent genetic response that affects not only whole body physiology [10] but also higher brain functions such as cognition. The increases in hippocampal size we documented in female rats on CR diets also correlate to changes seen in humans that are involved in task learning [21] or even exercise [22].",357a6e9d-6055-42f4-9a59-f07a6b036339
54,discussion7," These two interventions have been shown to increase hippocampal volume and neurogenesis through the creation of mild, tolerable stressors on the brain, and therefore it is likely that in the female mild CR results in a similar functional phenotype.  With respect to specific genes coherently altered by various dietary paradigms, there are several striking functional interactions, e.g. between two genes that conversely regulate cytokine signaling. Hence the 20% CR females show a robust elevation in Jak2 (Janus kinase 2) expression while there is a corresponding reduction in the levels of Pias1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT). Jak2 tyrosine kinase serves as a primary functional mediator of growth hormone, prolactin and interleukin signaling.",f8f1fa8e-8178-41eb-bb70-caec12222a43
55,discussion8," Upon ligand binding the receptor, Jak2 is recruited to proline-rich domains in the intracellular regions of the receptor where it activates and then tyrosine phosphorylates the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) families of transcription factors. Pias1 can act to functionally antagonize the generation of active STAT molecules [23]. Pias1 belongs to a family of proteins that promote the conjugation of sumo1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier-1) to different classes of proteins. This post-translational modification of proteins is described as sumoylation [24]. Sumoylation is mechanistically but not functionally related to ubiquitination. Ubiquitination destines target proteins to internalization and eventual degradation. Sumoylation engenders much more diverse actions such as promoting transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [25], protection from ubiquitination [26] and regulation of protein-protein interactions [27].",a5de9944-9d97-45b5-9e2f-3e32d403d1bd
56,discussion9," The up-regulation of Jak2 with the down-regulation of Pias1 may mediate effects of dietary energy intake on electrical excitability/gene transcription in the hippocampus. For example, GH can enhance the excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons [28] in a Jak2 and PI3-kinase-dependent manner, while Pias1 has been shown to directly sumoylate multiple members of the mGluR family of glutamate receptors [25]. We previously reported that there are considerable differences in the levels of GH in males and females in response to caloric restriction, i.e. females show increased GH levels whereas males show dramatic diminution of GH levels [10]. Whether this hormone variation alone mediates the cognitive changes seen in females on reduced energy diets is not known, but is consistent with many reports linking maintenance of GH levels in the elderly and preservation of cognitive capacity [for review see 29].",710622d3-af1b-4fe3-98d4-d22bb06f0c36
57,discussion10," The genes that are coherently controlled by reduced energy diets in females may cooperate to affect functional changes in neuronal networks. For example, several genes control synaptic actin dynamics including Lasp1 and Cct3 [19], [30], synaptic vesicle and protein trafficking (Syt4; [31]) as well as control hippocampal memory formation patterns (SRp20; [32]).  Changes in many different common and cell type-specific genes in the CNS are known to occur in response to many different environmental factors including exercise, age, diet, activity in neuronal circuits, and injury or disease [33]–[39]. Despite the fact that there are multiple phenotypic differences between male and female animals, the vast majority of diet studies and gene expression analyses have been performed only on males, and direct comparisons of hippocampal transcriptome responses of males and females to environmental factors, such as dietary intake, are largely lacking.",1074e136-7aac-485d-8c6a-f48fb8c00d90
58,discussion11," A recent study has shown that numerous genes, spanning numerous functional categories, were differentially expressed in the CNS of males and females [40]. In general, genes involved in protein degradation, oxidative stress resistance and cell survival were expressed at higher levels in females compared to males, which could suggest a superior ability of brain cells in females to resist oxidative and metabolic stress. Interestingly, the authors of this study found that there was a considerable amount of variability in the number of genes affected by sex among the different regions of the CNS, with the transcriptome of the hippocampus being the most sensitive to sex-differences in response to the one dietary alteration they tested, and the striatum and cerebellum being the least sensitive [40].",99429358-4139-4c7e-a57b-446cbae6a453
59,discussion12," This could potentially explain why, in the calorically restricted females, 14-Unit T-maze learning ability was significantly increased [10], since the hippocampus seems to be very sensitive to dietary energy input information. It is also interesting to note that in the males subjected to 40% CR, the total number of regulated genes was substantially greater than at 20% CR, this is perhaps indicative of a greater genetic response needed to maintain energy homeostasis in the face of severe caloric restriction. In contrast, the 40% CR females that demonstrated the greatest learning improvement in the 14-Unit T-maze in our previous study displayed a much smaller range of genetic modulation, perhaps suggesting the presence of a pre-programmed capacity, or ‘genetic engram’, to change in response to the caloric restriction. In future studies, we plan to relate the present findings and prior behavioral results of dietary manipulations to other cognitive tasks (e.g.",17af3e64-0f34-42da-a56c-7873d159b7c6
60,discussion13," the Morris Water Maze) where females typically show a performance decrement compared to males. Also, it would be very informative to detail changes in other brain structures that contribute to learning and memory besides the hippocampus.  It will be important to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin these sex-dependent alterations that occur in hippocampal transcriptomes in response to different levels of dietary energy intake. Gaining a greater appreciation of how male and female hippocampal cells respond to different levels of caloric intake could illuminate some of the potential downstream signaling pathways that are altered in a sex-dependent manner.",290669b0-e22a-4792-abf8-eacd3c04c76d
