0,background0," The standard of care for treating overweight and obesity is daily caloric restriction (daily caloric restriction (DCR)). While this approach produces modest weight loss, adherence to daily caloric restriction (DCR) declines over time and weight regain is common. Intermittent fasting (Intermittent fasting (IMF)) is an alternative dietary strategy for reducing energy intake (EI) that involves >60% energy restriction on 2–3 days per week, or on alternate days, with habitual intake on fed days. While numerous studies have evaluated Intermittent fasting (IMF) as a weight loss strategy, there are several limitations including lack of a standard-of-care daily caloric restriction (DCR) control, failure to provide guideline-based behavioral support, and failure to rigorously evaluate dietary and PA adherence using objective measures. To date, only three longer-term (52-week) trials have evaluated Intermittent fasting (IMF) as a weight loss strategy.",215504a0-6cd1-4d42-9c7a-2216b51ddd65
1,background1," None of these longer-duration studies reported significant differences between Intermittent fasting (IMF) and daily caloric restriction (DCR) in changes in weight. However, each of these studies has limitations that prohibit drawing generalizable conclusions about the relative long-term efficacy of Intermittent fasting (IMF) vs. daily caloric restriction (DCR) for obesity treatment.

Both groups will receive a guideline-based PA prescription [34] and a comprehensive, group-based behavioral weight loss intervention consistent with current guidelines for obesity treatment [17].  Intervention description {11a}  Intermittent fasting (Intermittent fasting (IMF)) group  Participants in this group will be instructed to limit EI to 20% of estimated individual daily weight maintenance energy requirements on three non-consecutive days per week. Weight maintenance energy requirements will be calculated as resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure (REE)) measured by indirect calorimetry multiplied by an activity factor of 1.5 [35].",5a2ed253-a92b-4b44-aa0f-12ae00a54f2a
13,methods11," On fed days, Intermittent fasting (IMF) participants will eat ad libitum, but will be encouraged to make healthy food and portion choices. This 80% energy restriction on three fast days per week translates to a targeted weekly energy deficit of ~34%. Participants will be guided to target diet macronutrient content of 55% carbohydrates, 15% protein, and 30% fat. Sample fast day menus and individualized fast day calorie goals will be provided to assist in achieving EI targets. On fast days, participants will be encouraged to consume their calories in their dinner meal. However, they will be allowed to consume their fast day calories at other times of the day if they have difficulty with the recommendation to consume all calories at dinner. A previous study using a similar Intermittent fasting (IMF) protocol [36] found that altering times of caloric intake during the modified fast day (i.e.",7e99289c-c447-4412-820b-bccd9c4b19a4
14,methods12,", consuming calories at lunch, dinner, or throughout the day) did not impact weight loss or compliance. Participants in this group will be instructed in calorie counting and food logging but will be asked to count calories and log food intake only on fast days.  We chose a modified Intermittent fasting (IMF) paradigm rather than a zero-calorie Intermittent fasting (IMF) paradigm (i.e., zero-calorie intake on fast days) for several reasons. First, our review of the scientific and lay literature revealed that the strategy largely endorsed is a modified Intermittent fasting (IMF) protocol (rather than a zero-calorie Intermittent fasting (IMF) protocol); thus, we felt a modified Intermittent fasting (IMF) protocol was the most clinically relevant paradigm to study. Second, in a prior study of a zero-calorie Intermittent fasting (IMF) intervention, the level of self-reported hunger remained high throughout the study [37].",04ac0da5-a07b-4dfe-85ee-097cea0714b0
15,methods13," In contrast, in studies using a modified Intermittent fasting (IMF) approach, hunger decreased [38, 39] or remained unchanged [40, 41] compared to pre-intervention levels, suggesting that long-term compliance may be better with a modified Intermittent fasting (IMF) protocol. Third, a cross-over study among n = 10 adults with overweight or obesity examined food intake 2 days after varying degrees of energy restriction: (1) isoenergetic intake, (2) partial 75% energy restriction (i.e., modified fast day), and (3) 100% energy restriction (i.e., zero-calorie fast day) [42]. Results suggested that a modified fast day produces a similar energy deficit as a zero-calorie fast day over a 3-day period because there is less compensatory increase in EI on the post-fast day with the modified fast [42].",31256967-6b2d-458c-9743-27dbe1d2e549
16,methods14," Lastly, we administered a brief online survey to 82 adults with overweight or obesity, who had recently completed a behavioral weight loss interventional trial with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria at our CU-AMC Anschutz Health and Wellness Center; 78% of respondents indicated that they would be more likely to adhere to a modified Intermittent fasting (IMF) protocol as compared to a zero-calorie Intermittent fasting (IMF) protocol in the context of a 52-week behavioral weight loss program.  Daily caloric restriction (daily caloric restriction (DCR)) group  Participants in this group will be given a calorie goal designed to produce a 34% energy deficit from baseline estimated individual weight maintenance energy requirements for the duration of the 52-week intervention. As in the Intermittent fasting (IMF) group, weight maintenance energy requirements will be determined as (measured resting energy expenditure (REE) × activity factor of 1.5) [35].",5143c301-d747-420b-b0f0-4e68727f32aa

PA prescription  Participants in both groups will also receive a recommendation to gradually increase moderate intensity PA to 300 min/week over the initial 26 weeks and to maintain this level of PA for the duration of the study (see Table 1 for ramp-up). This target is consistent with current PA guidelines for weight management [34, 43].

Evidence-based dietary approaches to energy restriction that are effective long-term are needed to provide a range of evidence-based options to individuals seeking weight loss. Intermittent fasting (IMF) may represent a promising dietary strategy to help more people achieve weight loss and improve their metabolic health. A recent systematic review identified 27 Intermittent fasting (IMF) trials (published between 7/1/2019 and 1/1/2000) reporting weight loss ranging from 0.8 to 13.0% of baseline weight, with no serious adverse events [16].",f7059a92-9fed-4dd5-b1ea-d65526e386b8
71,discussion1," However, the current evidence base has significant limitations including lack of a standard-of-care daily caloric restriction (DCR) control, failure to provide guideline-based behavioral support, and failure to rigorously evaluate dietary and PA adherence using objective measures. To date, only three longer-term (52-week) trials have evaluated Intermittent fasting (IMF) as a weight loss strategy [19–21]. None of these longer-duration studies reported significant differences between Intermittent fasting (IMF) and daily caloric restriction (DCR) in changes in weight. However, each of these studies has limitations that prohibit drawing generalizable conclusions about the relative long-term efficacy of Intermittent fasting (IMF) compared to daily caloric restriction (DCR) for obesity treatment.",e7ca8488-9d6d-4606-84e1-70b3d35f7316
72,discussion2," Thus, greater scientific rigor is required from interventional trials than found in the current literature and well-designed trials are needed to demonstrate long-term effectiveness and to understand the impact of Intermittent fasting (IMF) on energy balance.  daily caloric restriction versus intermittent fasting (DRIFT) will fill this gap in the literature by examining the effectiveness of Intermittent fasting (IMF) as a dietary strategy to achieve weight loss compared to daily caloric restriction (DCR), the current standard-of-care, within the context of a 52-week, guideline-based behavioral support program for obesity treatment. We will use objective methods to measure EI (doubly labeled water (DLW) intake-balance method) and PA (activPA level (PAL) device) to allow for an accurate comparison of adherence to the dietary and PA prescriptions between the Intermittent fasting (IMF) and daily caloric restriction (DCR) groups.",43b07e9e-e6b0-4fe1-8671-4c951f0d07be
73,discussion3," This trial is also unique in that it will be one of the first obesity treatment trials to implement the recommendations from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Accumulating Data to Optimally Predict obesity Treatment (ADOPT) framework to evaluate selected biologic, behavioral, environmental, and psychosocial predictors of weight loss response [24–28]. Our findings may have significant public health implications as this study will generate robust data regarding long-term weight loss effectiveness of Intermittent fasting (IMF) as compared to daily caloric restriction (DCR). We anticipate that results will further our understanding of the impact of Intermittent fasting (IMF) on energy balance and will provide preliminary insight into predictors of weight loss response within Intermittent fasting (IMF) and daily caloric restriction (DCR).

74,discussion4," Outcome measures at 78 weeks are expected to be completed by 12/19/2022. We were unable to submit our protocol manuscript prior to completing participant recruitment due to the substantially increased investigator and research staff burden necessitated by COVID-19-related clinical research shutdown activities, followed by COVID-19-related clinical research reactivation activities (including developing, obtaining approval for, and implementation of protocols to safeguard clinical research staff and participants as required by CU-AMC). The additional research burden related to COVID-19 protocols was compounded by frequent staff quarantines and limited access to research offices which required us to focus all investigator and research staff effort on study conduct.
