0,introduction0," Intermittent fasting, including alternate day fasting (alternate day fasting (ADF)), has grown in popularity as it can produce clinically significant metabolic benefits and is often considered to be easier to adhere to than other types of diets such as chronic calorie restriction. However, the effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) on diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction, and the role of adipose-derived hormones, i.e., adipokines, in mediating its effects, remain largely unknown.  Objective  We aimed to test the hypothesis that alternate day fasting (ADF) protects against diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, at least partly through modulating adipokine profiles. ",bfa3dd4e-c4de-4ac9-8f08-5cb76dcb683a
1,methods0," Control mice (m Leprdb) and diabetic mice (Leprdb) were treated with 12-weeks of alternate day fasting (ADF). Glucose metabolism, endothelial function, and adipokine profile were assessed.   Animal Models and Treatment  The procedures followed were in accordance with approved guidelines set by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Missouri (Columbia, MO, United States). Mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, United States). Homozygote type 2 diabetic mice (Leprdb; BKS.Cg-Dock7m + / + LeprdbJ, JAX 000642, black and obese) are wildtype for Dock7 and homozygous for Leprdb (10, 11). The heterozygote control mice (m Leprdb, black and lean) from the colony are heterozygous for Dock7m and heterozygous for Leprdb. Because of the sterility of Leprdb homozygotes, the misty (Dock7m) mutation has been incorporated into stocks for maintenance of the diabetes mutation (10, 11).",38d22346-c64d-4144-a569-38c135429ccf
2,methods1," The repulsion double heterozygote facilitates the identification of heterozygotes for breeding (10, 11). Mice that are homozygous for Dock7m and wildtype for Lepr from the colony (gray and lean) are discarded (10, 11). The Leprdb mice demonstrate morbid obesity, chronic hyperglycemia, and are polyphagic, polydipsic, and polyuric (10, 11). Heterozygotes control mice (m Leprdb) are normal in body weight, blood glucose, and plasma insulin (10, 11).  Mice were maintained on a standard rodent diet. Twelve to sixteen week-old, male, 20–35 g m Leprdb, and 40–60 g Leprdb mice were used in this study. Mice were fed ad libitum on alternate days and then moved to a separate cage without food (starting at 9 a.m.) for 24 h to prevent food from being stored in the bedding. Mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and between 18–23°C according to animal protocols and NIH guidelines.",f29cf3f1-8d6e-4936-9833-caafd8744c39
3,methods2," To determine the effects of recombinant resistin treatment, Leprdb mice were treated with murine recombinant resistin (Biovision, Cat# 4560-100, 15 μg/per mouse/day, i.p. injection, for 4 days) as previously described (26).  Measurement of Body Weight and Abdominal Girth  Body weight was determined using an electronic balance. Abdominal girth was measured with the use of a soft ruler (27).  Measurement of Blood Parameters  After animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg i.p.), whole blood samples were obtained from the vena cava. A whole blood sample was held for 30 min at room temperature to allow clotting. The sample was centrifuged at 2,000–3,000 g for 10 min at 4°C; the serum was transferred to separate tubes without disturbing blood clots and stored at −80°C until analysis. Commercial ELISA kits were used to measure serum levels of adiponectin (Millipore, EZMADP-60K), resistin (R&D, MRSN00), and leptin (Millipore, EZML-82K) (28).",03950c1f-8efe-4419-b791-9b5a1ede2404
4,methods3," Similarly, total cholesterol levels were assessed using spectrophotometric assays (Biovision, K603-100) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (28).  Measurement of Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance  Fasting blood glucose levels were measured by OneTouch Ultramini glucometer (LifeScan). Fasting serum insulin level was measured with the use of a commercial kit (ALPCO, 80-INSMSU-E01). Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance; homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) using the following formula: HOMA-IR = (glucose [mmol/L]) × (insulin [mU/L])/22.5 (21).  Insulin Tolerance Test  Mice were fasted overnight and weighed. The tail was nicked with a fresh razor blade by horizontal cut of the tip and a OneTouch Ultramini glucometer was used to measure baseline blood glucose after overnight fasting. 1.0 unit per kg body weight of diluted porcine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.",f9d145a3-e1ee-48fa-b781-d2505b676c54
5,methods4," Louis, MO, United States, I5523) was subsequently injected into the intraperitoneal cavity. Blood glucose was sampled from the tail of each mouse by gently massaging a small drop of blood onto the glucometer strip at 0 (baseline), 15, 30, 60, and 90 min following insulin injection (29).  Adenovirus-Mediated Gene Transfer  Adenovirus vector containing the gene for full-length mouse adiponectin (Ad-APN) was generously gifted by Dr. Shinji Kihara (Department of Internal Medicine and Molecular Science, University of Osaka, Osaka, Japan) (30). HEK-293 AD cells were passaged two to three times before infection and cultured until the floating monolayer was 90–100% confluent. Cells were replenished with 15 ml new growth media containing 10% FBS per 75-cm2 flask with either Ad-APN or adenovirus containing β-galactosidase (Ad-βgal) added to the culture. After 24 h, 10 ml growth media was added to the culture flask, and the viruses were allowed to produce for another 24 h.",86f66773-35cc-496e-b6b3-3de18fb2e0dc
6,methods5," When all cells were floating, the culture flask was gently shaken, and all media, including the cells, were transferred to a 50-ml sterile tube, which was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 0.8 ml culture medium. The adenoviruses were released from the cells by repeated freeze-thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen. After centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected for immediate purification of adenoviruses using a commercial purification kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, United States). The concentration of purified adenovirus was measured using the commercial QuickTiter Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay Kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Either Ad-APN or Ad-βgal at 1 × 109 plaque-forming units was injected intravenously via the tail vein of m Leprdb and Leprdb mice. All mice were euthanized 7 days after virus injection.",aa471d6b-1c5c-4418-94e5-0da58ef8a331
7,methods6," Mice that did not show an increase in serum adiponectin levels (as measured by ELISA) were excluded from the functional assessment (20).  Functional Assessment of Small Mesenteric Arteries  Mesenteric arteries (first order of main branches) with internal diameter of 200–250 μm were cut into 2 mm long rings and mounted in a Myograph 610M (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, United States) (31). The passive tension-internal circumference was determined by stretching to achieve an internal circumference equivalent to 60–70% of that of the blood vessel under a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg. Vessels were maintained in Physiological Saline Solution (Physiological Saline Solution (PSS)) bubbled with 95% O2–5% CO2 at 37°C for the remainder of the experiment. Physiological Saline Solution (PSS) contained 118.99 mM NaCl, 4.69 mM KCl, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 1.17 mM MgSO4•7H2O, 2.50 mM CaCl2•2H2O, 14.9 mM NaHCO3, 5.5 mM D-Glucose, and 0.03 mM EDTA.",f1160887-8537-44f2-b70b-d6a088d2fb4a
8,methods7," After an equilibration period of 45 min, vessels were precontracted with 1 μmol/L phenylephrine (PE). A cumulative dose–response curve was obtained by adding acetylcholine (ACh, 1 nmol/L–10 μmol/L) and sodium nitroprusside (Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 1 nmol/L–10 μmol/L). Relaxation at each concentration was measured and expressed as the percentage of force generated in response to 1 μmol/L PE. NO availability was evaluated by ACh concentration-response curve repeated after incubation with the NO synthase inhibitor N-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 μM, 20 min). PE-induced vasoconstriction was evaluated by cumulative addition of PE (1 nmol/L to 10 μmol/L). The contraction induced by PE was normalized to the maximal force of contraction induced by 120 mM of KCl (27, 32).",de045388-8b09-470b-bd30-4d6d786464e5
9,methods8,"  Determination of mRNA Expression by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction  Total RNA was extracted from 10 mg of mesenteric adipose tissue (mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT)) using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, United States) (27, 32). The quality and quantity of total RNA were determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nano Drop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Total RNA (1.0 μg) was processed directly to cDNA synthesis using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed using an i-Cycler (I-Q5, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, United States). Reactions were carried out in triplicate in a total volume of 25 μl using SYBR green qPCR Master Mix (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The 2–ΔΔCT method (–ΔΔCT = CT,target gene – CT,Actb, where CT is threshold cycle) was used to analyze the change of target gene expression.",8efbeabc-4574-4935-8bb3-1fc2cdbb45d2
10,methods9," The housekeeping gene Actb was used for internal normalization. Mean CT values for both the target and internal control genes were determined. Results are presented as fold change of transcripts for target normalized to internal reference (Actb), compared with m Leprdb (defined as 1.0 fold) (27, 32). The primer sets were designed by Primer3 (33): mouse Adipoq (forward primer: 5′-AGGTTGGATGGCAGGC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GTCTCACCCTTAGGACCAAGAA-3′), Retn (forward primer: 5′- TTCCTTGTCCCTGAACTGCT-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-CAAGACTGCTGTGCCTTCTG-3′), Lep (forward primer: 5′- TGTCCAGGGTTGATCTCACA-3′and reverse primer: 5′- TCCCACTGGAACAAAACTCC-3′), and Actb (forward primer: 5′-GCTCTTTTCCAGCCTTCCTT-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-CTTCTGCATCCTGTCAGCAA-3′) (20). The efficiency of the PCR reaction was determined using a dilution series of a standard mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) sample.",d36d026c-1dac-4055-baf0-8832590c1d11
11,methods10,"  Protein Expression by Western Blot Analyses  In total, 10 mg of mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT), or 4-6 branches of small mesenteric arteries (small mesenteric arteries (SMA)) were homogenized in lysis buffer (Cellytic™ MT Mammalian Tissue Lysis/Extraction Reagent, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). Protein concentration was assessed using BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL, United States), and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Protein expression was detected using anti-nitrotyrosine primary antibody (Abcam, Cat#ab7048, 1:500) anti-tubulin primary antibody (Abcam, Cat#ab6160, 1:5,000), Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used. Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, United States), scanned densitometrically using Fuji LAS3000 and quantified with Multigauge software (Fujifilm).",b8c67bd4-eba2-40c0-b67e-ece13939356d
12,methods11," The relative amounts of protein expression were quantified to those of the corresponding m Leprdb control, which was set to a value of 1.0 (27, 32).  Data Analysis  All data were presented as mean ± SEM except as specifically stated. For insulin tolerance tests and vasomotor responses under various dosages, two-way repeated ANOVA was used to determine how the responses were affected by two factors (alternate day fasting (ADF) × Time as the repeated measure for insulin tolerance tests, and alternate day fasting (ADF) × dosage as the repeated measure for vasomotor responses), followed by the post hoc Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. For other data obtained from the four groups (m Leprdb, m Leprdb + alternate day fasting (ADF), Leprdb, Leprdb + alternate day fasting (ADF)), one-way ANOVA was used to compare the groups defined by one factor, followed by the post hoc Fisher’s Least Significant Difference test for multiple comparisons.",d623a9d4-7101-484c-8cf0-ab403d097f01
13,methods12," Statistical analyses were performed using SPhysiological Saline Solution (PSS)11.5. Significance was accepted at P < 0.05. The sample size was empirically determined based on our previous studies examining the metabolic and endothelial function of Leprdb mice and their respective m Leprdb control mice (20, 27, 28, 32, 34, 35). Mice were grouped by genotype and weight-matched thus not randomized. Blinded analysis was not performed because of feasibility. ",b60ab4e3-bfba-4e1a-80cc-6b213402a43b
14,results0," The Effects of Alternate Day Fasting on Body Weight, Abdominal Girth, Fasting Total Cholesterol, Fasting Glucose, Fasting Insulin, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance in Control and Diabetic Mice  Mice on the alternate day fasting (ADF) diet were allowed to eat ad libitum for one day, and then given no food the next day. This regimen was maintained for 12 weeks. Meanwhile, mice without alternate day fasting (ADF) were continually allowed to feed ad libitum. Food intake was measured on the feast day for mice with or without alternate day fasting (ADF) once per week. alternate day fasting (ADF) led to a net reduction of food intake at 41.8 ± 4.1% in m Leprdb mice and 40.2 ± 4.7% in Leprdb mice. As expected, the Leprdb diabetic mice showed higher body weight, abdominal girth, total cholesterol, blood glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the m Leprdb control mice.",555ae338-23ce-4636-950d-e0affc136137
15,results1," In m Leprdb control mice, 12-week alternate day fasting (ADF) reduced body weight, abdominal girth, and insulin. Although alternate day fasting (ADF) modestly reduced total cholesterol, glucose, and HOMA-IR in m Leprdb control mice, the P-values were greater than 0.05, we thus cannot conclude that significant differences exist. In Leprdb mice, alternate day fasting (ADF) did not significantly reduce body weight, abdominal girth, and total cholesterol. alternate day fasting (ADF), however, remarkably reduced blood glucose and HOMA-IR without affecting insulin levels (Table 1), supporting the profound effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) on improving glucose metabolism despite the lack of effects on weight loss in diabetic mice.

16,results3," Insulin tolerance tests revealed that diabetic mice (Leprdb) had impaired glucose metabolism compared with control mice (m Leprdb). Twelve weeks of alternate-day fasting (alternate day fasting (ADF)) improved insulin sensitivity in both Leprdb and m Leprdb mice.

Alternate Day Fasting Rescued Endothelial Dysfunction of Small Mesenteric Arteries in Diabetic Mice  small mesenteric arteries (SMA) represent resistance arteries contributing to vascular resistance and regulation of blood flow. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was impaired in small mesenteric arteries (SMA) of Leprdb diabetic mice vs. m Leprdb control mice. alternate day fasting (ADF) remarkably improved the endothelial function of diabetic mice (Figure 2A).",b31f6680-4b32-4b90-99d0-66e0a6a357eb
17,results4," Sodium nitroprusside (Sodium nitroprusside (SNP))-induced endothelium-independent vasorelaxation (Figure 2C) and phenylephrine (PE)-induced vasoconstriction (Figure 2D) were comparable among groups. Incubation with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) largely attenuated the alternate day fasting (ADF)-induced improvement of endothelial function in diabetic mice (Figure 2B). In m Leprdb mice, alternate day fasting (ADF) also showed a trend toward increasing the % of maximal relaxation at an ACh concentration of 10–7 mol/L. alternate day fasting (ADF) did not affect endothelium-independent vasorelaxation or PE-induced vasoconstriction in m Leprdb control mice (Figure 2).

19,results6,"  Alternate Day Fasting Modulates Circulating Adipokine Profile and Their Expression by Adipose Tissue  Adiponectin levels were lower in the serum of Leprdb mice, and alternate day fasting (ADF) increased serum adiponectin back to the level of m Leprdb control mice (Figure 3A). Serum resistin was lower in Leprdb mice than in m Leprdb control mice. alternate day fasting (ADF) increased resistin in both m Leprdb control mice and Leprdb diabetic mice (Figure 3B). As expected, Leprdb mice showed dramatically increased serum leptin, i.e., hyperleptinemia due to the lack of leptin receptor. alternate day fasting (ADF) reduced serum leptin in m Leprdb control mice, yet further increased serum leptin in Leprdb mice (Figure 3C).  FIGURE 3 alternate day fasting (ADF) modulated circulating levels and adipose expression of key adipokines, including adiponectin, resistin, and leptin in mesenteric adipose tissue (mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT)) of both m Leprdb and Leprdb mice.",57230608-3118-4a67-a26a-8463b7ed5dd7
20,results7," Circulating levels of adiponectin (A), resistin (B), and leptin (C) were determined by ELISA. mRNA expression of Adipoq (D), Retn (E), and Lep (F) were determined by qRT-PCR in mesenteric adipose tissue (mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT)).

Adipose tissue is the primary source of adipokines released into circulation (36). We further determined mRNA expression of these adipokines in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT). Consistent with the trend of circulating adipokine levels, Leprdb mice showed increased Lep mRNA (encoding leptin) in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) (Figure 3F), while reduced Retn mRNA (encoding resistin) (Figure 3E) compared with m Leprdb control mice.",3d77b3d7-6c52-4b37-8f80-ce57b8b19cb8
21,results8," Adipoq mRNA (encoding adiponectin) in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) was not statistically different between m Leprdb and Leprdb mice (Figure 3D). alternate day fasting (ADF) increased Adipoq mRNA in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) of m Leprdb control mice, though circulating adiponectin in m Leprdb control mice was not altered by alternate day fasting (ADF) (Figure 3D), likely suggesting post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms limiting a further increase in circulating levels. alternate day fasting (ADF) further increased Lep mRNA in the mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) of m Leprdb control mice, though serum leptin was reduced by alternate day fasting (ADF) (Figure 3E).  Overall, in Leprdb mice, adipokine levels in the serum and mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) showed consistent directionality following alternate day fasting (ADF).",ec2b344a-7172-4de7-b692-219a3f3a1b9c
22,results9," In m Leprdb control mice, however, the increase in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) mRNA expression of Adipoq and Lep did not correlate with change in the circulation, likely suggesting possible feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis in non-diabetic control mice.  The Endothelial Protective Effects of Alternate Day Fasting Were Partly Mediated Through Enhanced Adiponectin  To determine if alternate day fasting (ADF) improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation through modulating adipose-derived hormones, we treated control and diabetic mice with adenovirus expressing adiponectin (Ad-APN) or β-galactosidase (Ad-βgal) as the control. As we have previously described (20), mice were euthanized one week after adenovirus treatment and increased circulating adiponectin levels were confirmed by ELISA. Indeed, adiponectin supplementation partly improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in Leprdb mice (Figure 4A), without affecting endothelium-independent vasorelaxation (Figure 4B).",4cfd6aff-cfc6-4443-8b34-dfac550a1dbf
23,results10," To dissect if other adipokines were also involved in alternate day fasting (ADF)-mediated endothelial protective effects, Leprdb mice were treated with recombinant murine resistin (15 μg/mouse/day for 4 days, i.p.) according to a previously published protocol (26). The short-term treatment of resistin did not impair or improve endothelium-dependent or -independent vasorelaxation (Figures 4C,D), suggesting that short-term resistin administration may not affect vascular function. Similarly, Leprdb mice showed increased circulating leptin due to leptin receptor deficiency. Circulating leptin was further enhanced by alternate day fasting (ADF), suggesting that an increase in circulating leptin itself was unlikely to prevent the vascular benefits of alternate day fasting (ADF). Thus, our study provided some mechanistic insights into the contribution of adipokines to alternate day fasting (ADF)-mediated vascular effects in type 2 diabetes.",f2c776bc-9b6a-4f54-92c9-7171ba5964eb

27,discussion0," Studies demonstrate that intermittent fasting improves cardiometabolic risk factors such as blood pressure, levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, insulin resistance, and HbA1c (5). A better understanding of how intermittent fasting affects cardiovascular function and the underlying mechanisms will facilitate its clinical application in obesity and diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications. Our study revealed the profound benefits of alternate day fasting (ADF) in rescuing endothelial dysfunction. The benefits are at least partly mediated through enhanced adiponectin, while resistin and leptin were unlikely to be involved. Adiponectin thus provides a mechanistic link between the role of alternate day fasting (ADF) in regulating adipokine profile and endothelial function in type 2 diabetes.",fe462deb-6966-47ad-a0cf-35f0c4ad8990
28,discussion1," alternate day fasting (ADF) reduced the marker of oxidative stress in resistance arteries but not adipose tissue, suggesting tissue-specific regulatory roles by alternate day fasting (ADF). alternate day fasting (ADF) may also exert metabolic and vascular benefits in non-obese control mice. Overall, our data support that alternate day fasting (ADF) presents as promising lifestyle intervention for treating diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction.  Intermittent fasting is emerging as a popular alternative dietary intervention strategy. Despite limited numbers of clinical trials directly comparing the long-term effects of intermittent fasting and daily calorie restriction, current evidence supports equivalent or superior metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting (5).",05fa5993-7dc3-403a-994f-036c171e9e13
29,discussion2," Comparative studies in a 12-month study of insulin-resistant participants support that alternate day fasting (ADF) may produce greater reductions in fasting insulin and insulin resistance compared with calorie restriction despite similar decreases in body weight (37). Experimental studies in C57BL/6J mice suggested that alternate day fasting (ADF) produces similar beneficial modulation of body fat distribution and adiponectin levels as does daily calorie restriction (38). In Leprdb type 2 diabetic mice and streptozotocin-treated type 1 diabetic mice treated with a fasting-mimicking diet, both intermittent fasting and continuous calorie restriction significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity. Yet, intermittent fasting performed significantly better than continuous calorie restriction in improving glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in Leprdb type 2 diabetic mice (39).",4f0208d1-9de8-4213-9ae5-8363cced1670
30,discussion3," Clinical studies, conducted over multiple years, that directly compare different regimens will provide important insights into the long-term cardiometabolic benefits of these diets.  There are currently no clinical studies determining the vascular benefits of long-term alternate day fasting (ADF) in patients with diabetes. Clinical trials of short-term alternate day fasting (ADF), e.g., 8–12 weeks, have, however, provided promising evidence. In obese subjects (n = 32), alternate day fasting (ADF) with a low-fat diet, but not a high-fat diet, for 8-weeks showed improved brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (40). Increases in adiponectin were positively associated with augmented flow-mediated vasodilation post-alternate day fasting (ADF) in those subjected to alternate day fasting (ADF) with the low-fat diet (40). alternate day fasting (ADF) also reduced plasma resistin and leptin, which were not correlated with changes in flow-mediated vasodilation (40).",cedbea6f-5359-4b6e-89fa-09f8ed542b79
31,discussion4," In a study involving 54 obese non-diabetic subjects with an 8-week alternate day fasting (ADF) protocol, brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation was positively correlated to adiponectin concentrations (41). Another study involving 64 obese subjects supported that a 12-week period of alternate day fasting (ADF) improved brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (42). Our experimental data strongly support the profound endothelial protective effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) in mice modeling severe type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study determining the role of alternate day fasting (ADF) in diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction. The above clinical studies in obese subjects and our experimental study in type 2 diabetic mice provide premises to further explore the clinical benefits of long-term alternate day fasting (ADF) in diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications.",7e14ec6e-45bb-46f1-81cb-308761c52f6c
32,discussion5,"  Our study has shed light on the mechanisms of the endothelial protective effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) partly through enhanced circulating adiponectin. Adiponectin is well known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative roles in endothelial cells (43) and its protective effects against neointimal formation in response to vascular injury (44) and atherosclerosis (45). Our previous work has also supported that adiponectin abates diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction by suppressing oxidative stress, adhesion molecules, and inflammation in type 2 diabetic mice (20). Specifically, adenovirus-mediated adiponectin supplementation improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of aortas in Leprdb mice (20). Adiponectin supplementation reduced aortic nitrotyrosine protein levels, via suppressing protein expression of gp91phox, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and increasing protein expression of SOD3, an antioxidant enzyme (20).",7b2a70af-c1cd-4a59-949b-39d341b0345c
33,discussion6," Aortic expression of inflammatory genes, Tnf, Il6, and Icam1, was also suppressed by adiponectin supplementation (20). These pathways are likely responsible for the endothelial protective and anti-oxidative effects of adiponectin in mesenteric arteries of Leprdb mice undergoing alternate day fasting (ADF). The adiponectin-independent endothelial protective and anti-oxidative effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) remain to be further dissected, and we speculate that the metabolic benefits of alternate day fasting (ADF) may play important roles.  Alternate day fasting exerts profound metabolic benefits in both control and diabetic mice with remarkably improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. The effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) on weight loss and visceral adiposity were, however, modest. In particular, alternate day fasting (ADF) led to ∼4% weight loss in Leprdb mice that did not reach statistical significance (Table 1).",9cb464c0-6d93-487a-8c72-6a06e59579e8
34,discussion7," Consistent with our observation, an independent study also suggested that a 13-week period of intermittent fasting, using a fasting mimicking diet protocol, improved glucose homeostasis in Leprdb mice without causing weight loss (39). Our previous study examining the effects of bariatric surgery in Leprdb mice demonstrated a ∼15–18% weight reduction following gastric bypass surgery that was accompanied by significantly improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity (27). Thus, the metabolic benefits of alternate day fasting (ADF) in Leprdb diabetic mice are likely not entirely dependent on weight loss effects. Since the Leprdb mice resemble severe type 2 diabetes, whether alternate day fasting (ADF) may also exert limited benefits in weight management in patients with type 2 diabetes, despite profound metabolic effects, should be studied clinically.",350ce177-d13b-42c6-9666-fe0a0963a222
35,discussion8," In m Leprdb control mice, alternate day fasting (ADF) led to statistically significant weight loss (∼11%, Table 1), and further improved glucose metabolism with a trend toward improved endothelial function. Further, the benefits of alternate day fasting (ADF) in non-obese, healthy humans thus may also warrant further investigation.  There are many questions that remain to be explored. Future studies may further elucidate if the knockout of adiponectin abolishes the vascular protective effects of alternate day fasting (ADF), the involvement of other adipokines, and the molecular mechanisms by which alternate day fasting (ADF) modulates adipokine expression and secretion. Comparative studies are required to tackle how different intermittent fasting regimens affect metabolic, vascular, and hormonal parameters. Findings generated from such studies could inform whether one regimen is superior to the others and elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the cardiometabolic benefits.",a299d332-a554-4441-a4a9-0dc2d042a9b3
36,discussion9," The discovery of pharmacological agents mimicking fasting can potentially provide novel therapeutic strategies. A potential limitation of the present studies is that they were performed only in male mice and mesenteric resistance arteries. Given possible sexual dimorphism in regard to obesity/diabetes-related macrovascular and microvascular disease, it will be important to extend our observations to females and in multiple vascular beds, such as aorta and coronary arteries, as well as the microvasculature.  Conclusion  In summary, our study examined the role and mechanisms of alternate day fasting (ADF) in diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction using murine models of type 2 diabetes. We have revealed that alternate day fasting (ADF) in type 2 diabetic mice exerts profound endothelial protective effects, partly through modulating the adipose-derived hormone, adiponectin.",59add2cb-7df8-4e56-978a-c02911ae5ee5
37,discussion10," Thus, this study improves our understanding of how alternate day fasting (ADF) affords significant protection against endothelial dysfunction partly by regulating adipose-derived hormones. Our work also elaborated on the metabolic benefits and potential cardiovascular protective actions of alternate day fasting (ADF) in the management of type 2 diabetes.
