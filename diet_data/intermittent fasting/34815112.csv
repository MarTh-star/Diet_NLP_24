0,methods0," Experimental Animals  Six-week-old wild-type male C57BL/6NTac mice (n=150) were obtained from InVivos, Singapore and housed upon arrival at the National University of Singapore Animal Facility. As shown in Figure 1A, at eight weeks of age, the mice were randomly assigned to either the ad libitum (AL) or the intermittent fasting (IF) diet regimen. Mice under the IF regimen underwent 16 hours of fasting every 24-hour period, with food available for the remaining 8 hours from 07:00 to 15:00 for four months (Lights on at 7:00, lights off at 18:00). All in vivo experimental procedures were approved by the National University of Singapore, Singapore Animal Care and Use Committee and performed according to the guidelines set forth by the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research, Singapore. All efforts were made to minimize any suffering and number of animals used.",15e41743-ea5d-4d78-9c4a-ce3741957e54
1,methods1," All sections of the manuscript were performed and reported in accordance to ARRIVE (Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. In a separate set of experiments, animals from both AL and IF groups (10-20 animals per group) underwent physiological measurements such as body weight, blood glucose and ketone levels throughout the four months as shown in Figure 1B-D.  Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Stenosis (bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)) Mouse Model  At six months of age, AL and IF experimental animals were further divided into three experimental groups: Sham, 15-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)) and 30-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). C57BL/6NTac mice were subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion injury by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)) surgery, as previously described 20.",f01ed185-b898-43c4-8a2d-a0940299c443
2,methods2," Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5- 2% at a flow rate of 0.4-0.8 litre/min), and a vertical midline incision was made in the neck. The left and right common carotid arteries were isolated from surrounding tissues and exposed individually, and loosely ligated with silk thread for easy manipulation of the arteries. The common carotid arteries were each constricted with microcoils of an internal diameter 0.18mm, specifically designed for the mice (microcoil specifications: piano wire with gold plating, piano wire diameter 0.08mm, coiling pitch 0.5mm, and total length of 2.5mm; Sawane Spring Co. Ltd, Japan). The silk threads were removed, and the site of surgery was closed. The mice were monitored post-surgery until they were awake. Sham animals were subjected to a midline cervical incision and their common carotid arteries were exposed, but no microcoils were inserted around the arteries.",af7f62c7-f589-49ac-b50f-b475dabb8ed4
3,methods3," The animals received bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) surgery during feeding hours in the daytime between 8am-12pm. All animals were euthanised at their respective endpoints after bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) for subsequent experimental analysis.  Cerebral Blood Flow Measurements  The Laser Speckle Contrast Imager (PSI system, Perimed Inc.) was used to obtain high-resolution cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)) measurements before bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) (baseline), immediately after bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) surgery (post-bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)) and finally at the end points of bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) (before sacrifice). As shown in Figure 1E, the brain regions of interest (regions of interest (ROI)) between the bregma and the lambda were selected to measure arbitrary units of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the area between the cerebral hemispheres.",9c78766c-6518-4f30-9cf5-b47cdb67182c
4,methods4," Briefly, the fur on the head was removed by shaving and the skull was exposed via a midline skin incision. The skull was cleaned gently using a cotton applicator with 1×phosphate-buffered solution (PBS). Throughout the imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF), the skull was kept moist and in order to improve imaging resolution, a non-toxic silicon oil was applied on the skull. Body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5ºC throughout the measurement periods. In the PeriCam PSI System, a CCD camera (2448×2048 pixels) that can take images in real-time was installed 10cm above the skull (speed 120 frames per second). Images were then acquired and analysed using a dedicated software package (PIMSoft, Perimed Inc.).  Immunoblot Analysis  Animals were euthanized by inhaled carbon dioxide and the brains were harvested at their respective time points.",7d676010-b217-4d48-b6b7-e8ff29d7f7ad
5,methods5," Different brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) were isolated immediately on ice and frozen in dry ice for future analysis (n=4-7 in each experimental group). Detailed immunoblot analysis procedures were performed as previously described 43. Briefly, brain tissues were homogenised in lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #78510) and combined with protease (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #78443) and phosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #78428) inhibitors to prevent proteolysis and dephosphorylation of proteins respectively during extraction, and then combined with 2x Laemelli buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Protein samples were then separated on 5-12.5% v/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) gel matrixes. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-treated proteins were separated based on their sizes. The proteins on the gels were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes to allow for probing.",7a573b8e-93c2-40dd-bced-7b30e92a731e
6,methods7," Following primary antibody incubation overnight, membranes were washed for 10 minutes thrice with 1×TBST before incubation with horseradish peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase (HRP))-conjugated secondary antibodies of dilution 1:1000 (Goat Anti-Rabbit - Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; Goat Anti-Mouse - Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation. Following secondary antibody incubation, membranes were washed for 10 minutes thrice with 1×TBST. Finally, the membranes were imaged using ChemiDocXRS+ imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) after the substrate, enhanced chemiluminescence (enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)), was added (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). ImageJ software (Version 1.46; National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to quantify proteins in relation to their corresponding housekeeping gene (β-actin/Vinculin).",0a8c943d-844d-4648-9649-d6b9faf4635c
7,methods8,"  DiI Vasculature Staining  At the end of each timepoint, a subset of animals (5 animals per experimental group) were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane, and perfusion through the heart was performed as described previously 44. Cardiac perfusion began with 25mL of chilled 1×PBS (pH 7.4) followed by perfusion of 10mL DiI solution (Sigma Aldrich, D-282, #42364, Invitrogen), and finally perfusion with 25mL of chilled fixative 4% paraformaldehyde. Once the perfusion was completed, the brains were harvested and placed in vials containing 4% paraformaldehyde solution for immersion-fixation overnight at 4ºC. The brains were then embedded in 5% agarose before sectioning by a vibratome (Leica VT1200) at a 100μm thickness and collected on slides. The tissue sections were viewed under a confocal microscope under a Texas Red Fluorescence Filter (TissueGnostics, TissueFAXS Slide Scanner).",cd0d6902-7f4b-425a-8555-2a7a9e256ae4
8,methods9," 100 coronal sections to represent the area between the bregma and lambda of each brain were examined under the confocal microscope. The representative image chosen were consistent at the 50th percentile, to best represent the area closest to the bregma.  Evans Blue Staining  At the end of each timepoint, a subset of animals (6-7 animals per experimental group) underwent Evans Blue (EB) Staining analysis as described previously 45. Briefly, the animals were anesthetised using isoflurane. 2% EB solution (Sigma Aldrich, E-2129-10G, diluted in 1xPBS and filtered, 2ml/kg) was injected through the femoral vein into the mice. The EB was allowed to circulate in the mice for 30mins. At the end of the 30mins, the mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide. Cardiac perfusion of 20ml 1×PBS was performed to remove residual EB in the blood, after which the brain was harvested and stored in dry ice.",9e1ad6c3-3cde-42fc-82bc-138a1b80a60e
9,methods10," Brain tissues were weighed, and the amount of 50% trichloroacetic acid (trichloroacetic acid (TCA)) solution (diluted in 0.9% saline) was calculated based on a 1:2 ratio of weight (mg): volume (μl). The tissue was homogenised in trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution. The mixture was then sonicated (10 cycles, 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off). Subsequently, the mixture was then allowed to incubate overnight at 4ºC on a rotator to allow for the complete extraction of EB from the brain tissues. The trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-lysate mixture was then centrifuged (30mins, 15,000rcf, 4ºC) and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was loaded in a 96-well plate with supplementation of 95% ethanol in a 1:3 ratio, respectively. The plate was then placed into a spectrophotometer at 620nm to determine the EB concentration.",9f3deb2a-0527-47b2-96fe-ff1602fb9db6
10,methods11,"  Luxol Fast Blue and Cresyl Violet Staining  Luxol fast blue (Luxol fast blue (LFB)) staining and expression of myelin basic protein (myelin basic protein (MBP)) revealed myelin integrity, while cresyl violet staining and expression of cell death markers were indicative assessments for neuronal loss in the hippocampus and different brain regions. Mouse brain tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then processed into paraffin wax blocks. Coronal sections (3μm thick) were obtained via microtome sectioning (Leica Biosystems, RM2255) and collected on slides (Trajan Scientific and Medical, Australia). Luxol Fast Blue (Luxol fast blue (LFB)) staining was performed to detect the severity of white matter lesions (white matter lesion (WML)s) in 5 regions (corpus collosum paramedian, corpus callosum median, caudoputamen, internal capsule and optic tract) in the brain.",9765d2cf-97c2-494d-9994-ce011780d0d6
11,methods12," Briefly, tissue sections were de-waxed and rehydrated before immersion into the Luxol fast blue (LFB) solution (Abcam, UK) at 37ºC overnight. Excess staining was removed using 95% ethanol treatment followed by washing in deionized water. Gray and white matter differentiation was initiated with the treatment of 0.05% aqueous lithium carbonate (Abcam, UK) for 20s, followed by 70% ethanol until the nuclei was decolorized. Sections were then immersed in Cresyl Violet solution (Abcam, UK) for 5 mins and the excess staining was washed in deionized water. The sections were then dehydrated in an ethanol gradient (70-100%), and finally cleared in xylene and mounted onto the slides (Fluoromount-G Mounting Medium, Invitrogen). Brightfield images were taken under ×60 magnification using an Olympus upright Fluorescence Microscope BX53.",e7725770-1ab0-496e-8db4-53d349285d6c
12,methods13," A white matter lesion (WML) severity index was calculated by giving each brain region a grade of either: Grade 0 (normal), Grade 1 (disarrangement of nerve fibres), Grade 2 (formation of marked vacuoles), or Grade 3 (disappearance of myelinated fibres). The severity of the white matter lesion (WML)s was scored by three blinded examiners and the number of neurons in CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus were counted as previously described 46.  Statistical Analysis  Experimental data were analysed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). All values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean. One-way analysis of variance was used, followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test to determine the significance between experimental groups. A P-value < 0.05 was deemed to be statistically significant. All experimental groups were compared against AL Sham conditions. ",9b9e5d9e-22dc-4a16-9cc2-125fe15d9bfc
13,results0," Intermittent fasting reduces body weight and increases plasma ketone levels, while improving cerebral blood flow recovery following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion  The summarized study design includes the timing of interventions, and blood and tissue collection (Fig. 1). At eight weeks of age, the mice were randomly assigned to either the ad libitum (AL) or the intermittent fasting (IF) diet regimen (Fig.1A). Male C57BL/6NTac mice were fed a normal chow diet (on a caloric basis: 58% carbohydrate, 24% protein, and 18% fat). Mice were randomly assigned to Sham, 15-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and 30-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) groups at six months of age when surgeries were performed. First, we monitored the physiological effects of IF on these mice. The IF group had a significantly lower body weight, a non-significant reduction in blood glucose level and a significant increase in blood ketone level than AL mice (Fig. 1B-D).",55ceac15-4a6f-4677-800a-51e4bd829c31
14,results1," We examined dynamic changes and recovery of cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow (CBF)) in the animals (Fig. 1E) using the Laser Speckle Imaging Technique. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured at three time points i.e. baseline, post-surgery and before sacrifice in both AL and IF animals over 15 and 30 days following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). At baseline, animals from all experimental groups had high cerebral blood flow (CBF) as indicated by the red perfusion colour. Sham did not show any reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF), as no microcoils were inserted onto the common carotid arteries. However, expectedly, following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) surgery (Post-surgery), AL and IF groups had a significant reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) compared to their corresponding Sham counterparts.",43f840b9-f16d-4ed9-9a14-b1d6872d7e3a
15,results2," Before sacrifice, at 15 days and 30 days post-surgery, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was found to increase and be restored in bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) animals. Interestingly, for the first time in the VaD model, we show that IF was able to demonstrate a better cerebral blood flow (CBF) recovery as compared to AL following hypoperfusive injury.  Intermittent fasting decreases microvascular leakage and maintains blood-brain barrier integrity following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion  We next analysed the effect of IF against hallmark vascular pathologies involving cerebrovascular structural and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrities following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). The first vascular pathology examined was the number of microvascular leakages that occurred following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) injury.",02fce18a-c580-4123-bdde-3fd0411dfa6c
16,results3," Fluorescence imaging of vasculature staining using a carbocyanine dye perfusion indicated a significant increase in the average number of microvascular leaks at 30 days after bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) in AL animals, while IF significantly reduced the number of microvascular leaks (Fig. 2A-B).  The second vascular pathology examined was the extent of blood brain barrier (BBB) damage following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) injury. We analysed blood brain barrier (BBB) damage using the Evans Blue technique and additionally examined TJ protein expression levels via immunoblot analysis in the AL and IF mice following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) (Fig. 2C-J). blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability after Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) was found to be significantly increased following 15 and 30 days of bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) under AL conditions.",e68588ef-f1a2-49ef-ade8-3dc67d0c9878
17,results4," In contrast, IF reduced blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability in both sham and bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice (Fig. 2C-D). To further analyse the structural integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB), we next examined the expression levels of TJ proteins between endothelial cells in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellar regions (Fig. 2E-J). There was evidence of reduced TJ expression following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) compared to Sham in AL animals, and IF was able to increase and maintain higher levels of TJ expression in all three brain regions. TJ protein zonula occludens (ZO-1) showed a significant reduction in expression levels following 30-day of bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) at the cortex and the hippocampus, and a non-significant reduction in the cerebellum. Conversely, IF increased the expression of ZO-1 in the cortex and cerebellum at both 15-day and 30-day time points (Fig. 2E-J).",224c9b37-0e43-4683-ab42-942589c1e34d
18,results5," Expression of occludin was significantly reduced following 15-day and 30-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) at the cortex and cerebellum regions in AL animals, while IF increased occludin expression significantly at both 15-day and 30-day timepoints in the cortex and cerebellum, but only at the 30-day timepoint in the hippocampus (Fig. 2E-J). Claudin-5 levels were maintained following 15-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS), but increased following 30-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) in the cortex and cerebellum. In the hippocampus, Claudin-5 levels showed a significant reduction in AL mice following the 30-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) timepoint. IF increased Claudin-5 levels in the cortex at the 15-day timepoint, and reduced Claudin-5 levels at the cerebellum at the 30-day timepoint.",867c3032-6797-4cc2-ab81-437fd188556a

Junctional adhesion molecule (junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A) expression was reduced significantly in AL animals following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) in the cerebellum and non-significantly in the cortex, but maintained in the hippocampus. IF maintained junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A expression levels in the cortex and hippocampus, but increased expression at the 15-day timepoint in the cerebellum (Fig. 2E-J). These data thus indicated that IF likely protected against Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown by maintaining TJ proteins compared to the AL diet.",cb624b11-d89c-4d0e-aaef-36e0b3525519
20,results7,"  Intermittent fasting attenuates white matter lesion injury, hippocampal neuronal loss and cell death following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion  We next analysed the effect of IF on neuronal pathologies such as white matter (WM) integrity, neuronal loss and cerebral cell death. The first neuronal pathology we examined was WM integrity and the corresponding WM protein known as myelin basic protein (myelin basic protein (MBP)) (Fig. 3). WM integrity after 15 or 30 days of Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) was assessed in 5 brain regions including the corpus callosum (paramedian), corpus collosum (medial), caudoputamen, internal capsule and optic tract (Fig. 3A-K). The severity of WM damage was significantly increased in the corpus callosum (paramedian) at the 30-day timepoint (Fig. 3B-C) and caudoputamen at 15-day and 30-day timepoints (Fig. 3F-G) in AL mice following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). At the corpus callosum (medial) (Fig. 3D-E) and internal capsule (Fig.",bf24f524-2726-43e6-99b6-084cb8eff263
21,results8," 3H-I), AL animals showed a non-significant, but more severe disruption in white matter compared to their IF counterparts. We found no change in white matter disruption at the optic tract (Fig. 3J-K). IF was able to generally maintain a lower WM severity score as compared to their AL counterparts at all 5 regions, specifically significant at the internal capsule in Sham and 15-day timepoints. We found a significant decrease in the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the cortex and cerebellum at the 30-day timepoint in AL animals (Fig. 3L-M, P-Q). IF increased myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in the cerebellum in bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice at the 15-day timepoint (Fig. 3P-Q).  The second neuronal pathology examined was hippocampal neuronal loss. bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS)-induced neuronal loss was evident in hippocampal regions (Fig. 4A-F).",e5eaa9dd-4e0c-4ebe-adbd-72605a742872
22,results9," Sham controls in all three regions showed densely packed nuclei, but there were signs of neuronal loss at CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions evident following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) in AL animals. In the CA1 region, neuronal count was reduced at the 30-day timepoint in AL animals (Fig. 4A-B). In the CA2 region, the neuronal count showed a non-significant reduction in neuronal numbers following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) in AL animals (Fig. 4C-D). In the CA3 region, there was a reduction in neuronal numbers at the 15-day timepoint following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) in AL animals (Fig. 4E-F). IF was able to rescue degeneration of neurons significantly at the 15- and 30-day time points as compared to their AL counterparts in all three hippocampal regions (Fig. 4A-F).  The third and final neuronal pathology examined was cerebral cell death following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH).",3bae5e52-a115-4368-9838-a639223435fe
23,results10," Therefore, we analysed the expression levels of caspase-3 in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum as a marker for apoptotic cell death (Fig. 4G-L). Our data shows that although total caspase-3 levels remained unchanged in all three brain regions. Cleaved caspase-3 was found to show little change in the cortex (Fig. 4G-H), a non-significant increase in the hippocampus (Fig. 4I-J), and a significant increase at the 15-day timepoint at the cerebellum (Fig. 4K-L) in AL animals, which suggests Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-mediated brain loss to be partly mediated by activation of the apoptotic caspase pathway. IF animals had reduced expression of cleaved caspase-3 at the sham and 30-day bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) timepoints at the cortex, and at the 15-day timepoint at the cerebellum.",c4274248-be0b-4777-b910-b9425cdc0740
24,results11,"  Intermittent fasting decreases matrix metalloproteinase and oxidative stress levels in the brain following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion  As various cellular and molecular pathways have been implicated in Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced brain injury, we postulated the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)s) in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix in the brain that could mediate both vascular and neuronal pathologies (Fig. 5). Our data established evidence for significantly increased expression of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)) at the cortex, and non-significant increase in MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) (Fig. 5A-F).",6a21695a-07dd-4fdc-84f9-9e45b28f46aa

Another mechanism we postulated to be involved in Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced brain injury was oxidative stress. We, therefore, analysed oxidative stress markers in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum (Fig. 5G-L).",fe7ad82b-9078-433c-b8dd-ae8364448584

Antioxidant glutathione levels were non-significantly lower in AL animals at the cortex and cerebellum following bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS), and at the hippocampus, glutathione levels remained unchanged. IF was able to significantly increase expression levels of glutathione at the cortex and cerebellum at the 30-day timepoint, but showed no change at the hippocampus (Fig. 5G-L).

29,discussion0," Our study establishes a consensus of the beneficial effect of IF against age-related diseases. The effect of IF achieved through intermittent metabolic switching which implies recurring periods of a bioenergetic challenge. IF leads to depletion of liver glycogen stores and production of ketones from adipose-cell-derived fatty acids, followed by recovery period. This metabolic switch results in coordinated molecular and cellular adaptations involving various signaling cascades. Current findings indicate such a metabolic switch protects against Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced neurovascular pathology in an animal model of vascular dementia. Prophylactic IF attenuated microvascular leakage, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, TJ breakdown, white matter injury, neuronal loss and cell death through a reduction in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and oxidative stress levels (Fig. 6).",1a1b5a51-5d30-4acc-b27d-f6174a8f1513
30,discussion1," Collectively, these data are the first to demonstrate the effect of IF on vascular and neuronal pathologies following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) injury, identifying IF as a potential therapeutic intervention for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI).  Following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), several hemodynamic changes occur in response to decreased blood flow in the brain. bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) surgery induces a reduction of global cerebral blood flow by approximately 30-40% before collateral development and recovery of blood flow 46. Microscopic imaging of capillaries in the brain have revealed local heterogeneities in cortical blood flow supply during hypoperfusion, such as reduced red blood cell perfusion 47.",2472affa-6365-4d13-b965-31ebd9ec8ad1
31,discussion2," Our present data demonstrate that IF can alleviate vascular damage induced under hypoperfusion conditions, as IF animals had greater cerebral blood flow recovery at 15 and 30 days after bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) surgery. In order to investigate the deep structural changes, we used a vasculature staining technique to observe vascular integrity. We showed that the number of microvascular leakages was lower in IF than AL animals during Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Leaky microvasculature are structural abnormalities on small vessels that lead to reduced cerebral perfusion, and are associated with aging and cognitive decline 48,49. Interestingly, we observed a rightward shift of leaky vessel formation in the brain at increasing time points. While we did not collect data between 15- and 30-days' time points to study the gradual changes of microvessel leakage, it may be attributed to repeated compromise of the blood vessels due to deteriorating brain pathology.",0f37faea-b536-4edc-ad88-f178822c0e04
32,discussion3," Nevertheless, we are able to provide strong evidence that IF maintained vascular integrity, which improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the brain following hypoperfusion.  We investigated blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), and the effects of prophylactic IF on the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) in order to understand the mechanisms involved. Increased blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability has been reported in animal models of Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) patients 50. However, there were no previous studies on the effect of IF on blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. We showed that prophylactic IF was able to maintain the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) under hypoperfused conditions via the Evans Blue technique.",a1aec0ae-67e2-4893-b8bd-9b058d083ef0
33,discussion4," Interestingly, the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) was improved even under Sham conditions, that may posit the possibility that IF improves blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity under normal physiological conditions. Investigation into the expression levels of molecular targets of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity, namely the TJ proteins, revealed that blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity was maintained with IF following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) via upregulation of TJ protein expression. TJ proteins such as zonula occludens (ZO-1), Occludin, Claudin-5 and junctional adhesion molecule (junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A) act as molecular gates between endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) 51. Our data are consistent with similar effects of IF on TJ proteins in the gut vasculature 52.",d9ccdc51-7e0e-4160-9792-3ac3553534bb
34,discussion5," While TJ protein expression levels were assessed, immunofluorescence studies to visualise the localisation of these TJ proteins may prove useful to be examined in future studies. Pericyte coverage and count, a property of the blood brain barrier (BBB) that contributes to its integrity was not examined in this study, but has been reported to be decreased in the brains of bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mice 53. The effect of IF on pericyte coverage may prove to be useful in future studies on blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity during Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH).  Following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), white matter lesion (WML)s are reported to have a presumed vascular origin, and are associated with cognitive decline in the elderly 54. Reduced blood flow to the white matter regions have been shown to predict the clinical development of white matter lesion (WML)s in the brain 55.",15ddec7f-3e34-489f-98bd-c55d3cf05f9f
35,discussion6," At the tissue level, the breakdown of myelin sheaths causes myelin basic protein (myelin basic protein (MBP)) network disassembly. A decrease in myelin basic protein (MBP) expression with Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) therefore demonstrates structural disruption of the myelin sheath and hence formation of white matter lesion (WML)s 56. We showed a striking difference between the severity of white matter lesion (WML)s and myelin basic protein (MBP) expression levels in animals under AL and IF diets. We observed that IF animals subjected to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) exhibited less white matter injury and maintenance of myelin basic protein (MBP) levels compared to those on the AL diet. Similar results have been reported in multiple sclerosis mouse models where IF reduced demyelination in the spinal cord 57.",a3f98385-2b06-4ab8-b25d-c3eb6c4316a8
36,discussion7,"  Another macroscopic neuronal pathologic lesion during Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is neurodegeneration which involves the loss of neurons particularly at the hippocampus that is associated with memory, behavioural changes and cognition 58. Sub-regions of the hippocampus - CA1, CA2 and CA3 are responsible for memory coding and retrieval. Specifically, the CA1 region is involved in the formation, consolidation, and retrieval of hippocampal-dependent memories 59; the CA2 region is involved in the formation of social memory 60, and the CA3 region is involved in memory processes and neurodegeneration 61. Tightly orchestrated programmed cell death signalling events are activated in response to Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), for which cell death markers such as caspase-3 play an important contributing role in apoptosis and hippocampal atrophy 56.",370ecfc5-bc00-4b90-927b-af2185bd0afe
37,discussion8," We found that neuronal loss, and apoptotic cell death activation were present in AL animals following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), consistent with a previous study 56. In this study, we demonstrate less neuronal loss in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 hippocampal regions in IF mice following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). This implicates a mechanism through which IF may improve cognitive functions. Previous evidence suggests that the cerebellum is involved in cognition and behaviour of animals 62. Hence, due to the increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 observed in the cerebellum, it may also be closely linked to cognitive loss during Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). We showed that IF attenuated cerebellar caspase-3 activation, which thus may mediate improved cognitive performance.",82777608-032a-4b1b-850a-9756524ea394
38,discussion9," Moreover, IF was also able to decrease cleaved caspase-3 levels in the cortex of Sham animals implying that it was able to suppress apoptotic cell death at basal conditions for reasons and mechanisms that remains to be fully elucidated.  It is important to elucidate the mechanism(s) at the molecular and cellular levels by which IF alleviates both vascular and neuronal pathologies following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Here, we investigated pathways previously implicated in blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, namely the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)s) and oxidative stress. Previously, an increase in matrix metalloproteinases, particularly matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 under Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) has been reported 63,64.",715dd0d7-1134-4164-8057-e17c33ac3658
39,discussion10," In our study, we showed a similar finding that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 was upregulated during Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), and IF reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in the brain. While the expression levels were assessed, the enzymatic activity of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)s may prove useful to examine in future studies. Similarly, there is also evidence that increased oxidative stress levels occur in the brain following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). We observed that IF reduced Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced increases in malondialdehyde levels, suggesting that reduced lipid peroxidation in the brain is a plausible mechanism through which IF attenuates neurovascular pathologies. Furthermore, IF increased anti-oxidant glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels in the brain following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH).",1f2d3fbf-c95c-44ad-978a-d91cc5b61a0f
40,discussion11," Our study suggests that IF exerts protective effects against vascular and neuronal pathologies through reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and oxidative stress.  The precise mechanisms through which IF promotes VaD pathological tolerance is not yet completely deciphered. Nevertheless, future work in systematically studying these mechanisms and the molecular pathways are warranted. However, it was previously established that IF protects against age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and neurodegeneration by targeting dysregulated energy mechanisms, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired lysosome and proteasome function, inflammation, cellular senescence and promoting the expression of genes by modulating epigenetic mechanisms that are essential for plasticity and regeneration 65,66,67,68. These pleiotropic adaptations of IF sets the stage for future work in the field of VaD.",ea6fb8a4-25af-481d-a8fb-e529cc46c758
41,discussion12,"  In summary, we have provided substantial evidence that prophylactic IF is effective in reducing vascular and neuronal pathologies following Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). While our study establishes IF as a potential therapeutic approach for attenuating vascular cognitive impairment (VCI)-related pathologies, further research is needed to test its clinical potential.
