0,introduction0,"Advanced age is the major risk factor for metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders . Mounting evidence from clinical studies and basic research indicate that metabolic dysfunction and brain function decline are causally linked. Type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to be a severe risk factor for developing dementia and neuromotor disease including Parkinson’s disease (PD; Athauda and Foltynie, 2016). Interestingly, insulin resistance in PD patients is associated with a more severe progression of the disease (Athauda and Foltynie, 2016) and insulin resistance has been proposed to be a good predictor of cognitive decline in humans . In experimental models, such phenomenon seems to be caused by increased dopaminergic neuron degeneration.",2369ee9a-839c-4361-a746-ad3695f7d65b
1,introduction1," Actually, fat overload in murine models of PD exacerbates neurodegeneration by stimulating iron deposition and specific basal ganglia changes in substantia nigra (SN) leading to impaired nigrostriatal dopamine function .  All these findings lead researchers to study whether reducing calorie intake by caloric restriction or fasting-based dietary strategies could prevent neurodegeneration. The molecular events activated by fasting are conserved from yeast to human and share the ability to protect brain function and metabolic health (Lettieri Barbato et al., 2012, 2015; Lettieri Barbato and Aquilano, 2016). Intermittent fasting (IF) is a generic term used to describe different forms of fasting such as alternate day fasting, periodic fasting, time-controlled fasting.",4b23b666-494c-4edf-9b3c-a6a58045a767
2,introduction2," Experimental evidence demonstrates a preventive role of IF in cognitive decline and many neurodegenerative disorders including PD both in rodents and human (Anton and Leeuwenburgh, 2013; Wahl et al., 2016; Mattson et al., 2017).  Omics approaches are an emerging field to evaluate the metabolic changes occurring after treatments or pathophysiological conditions. Lipids are a vast and heterogeneous class of compounds playing a plethora of functions in the brain including myelin formation , signaling (Michel and Bakovic, 2007), inflammation and neuroprotection  and are strongly related to neurological diseases . Food restriction was effective in preventing phospholipid turnover dysfunction in the brain during aging (Babenko and Shakhova, 2014). Shotgun lipidomics showed that caloric restriction determines important changes in myelin composition in the brain .",2f5df05a-8253-460e-8be2-f06df8eef33f
3,introduction3," Specific nutrient restrictions such as methionine restriction have important effects on brain lipid compositions. It has been observed that methionine-restricted mice undergo phospholipid changes and become more resistant to oxidative stress . This highlights a potential mechanism by which restriction of nutrients may improve brain functionality by phospholipids remodeling. Peculiar increases of brain amino acids, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, define several brain dysfunctions (Sheldon and Robinson, 2007). Notably, fasting strongly impacts on amino acid profile promoting significant reductions in plasma and tissues.  Environmental chemicals represent risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases including PD (Cannon and Greenamyre, 2011). The majority of PD cases are sporadic and chronic exposure to pesticides, such as the complex I inhibitors rotenone (Rot), may play a major role in the pathogenesis (Ascherio and Schwarzschild, 2016).",c73fd730-9878-45fd-b59b-40641e24d81b
4,introduction4," Whether IF may be protective also in this paradigm is currently undefined. Herein, we characterized the effect of IF in modulating brain metabolism and dopaminergic neuron degeneration by using metabolomics approaches. In particular, we treated mice with Rot in combination with IF. Rot is able to induce selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and PD-like features in animals . We found that 1 month IF was not sufficient to induce metabolic changes in SN; however, IF exacerbated Rot-mediated dopaminergic degeneration that was associated with increased inflammatory phospholipids and excitatory amino acids levels.

Experiments were carried out according to institutional safety procedures. Thirty-two C57BL/6J adult (8 weeks-age-old) male mice (purchased from Harlan Laboratories S.r.l., Urbino, Italy) were randomly divided in four groups: control mice (Ctr), IF-treated mice, Rot-treated mice (Rot) and IF/Rot-treated mice (IF/Rot). Rot (30 mg/Kg/day; R8875 Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water supplemented with 4% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (419273 Sigma-Aldrich) and 3% chloroform and daily dispensed via gavage for 28 days .

Rotarod analyses were performed both at the baseline prior the first rotenone administration (not included in the results) and 2 days before the end of treatment (at the fasting day and prior rotenone administration). Mice were placed on the rotarod (for mice, Cat N° 47600, Ugo Basile s.r.l., Italy) and sequentially tested at different speeds from 7 rpm to 25 rpm. When mice felt of the rotarod, they were placed back on it for the remaining time. On testing days, each mouse performed one pre-trial (not included in the results) to enable the mice to habituate to the rotarod. The trial was carried out after 2 h of rest.

Dopaminergic region was identified starting at approximately Bregma −4.30 mm to Bregma −2.63 mm according to Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. This area was cut in 25 μm cross sections with a Leitx rotary microtome. Seventy sections were placed on 13 slides in order to have complete posterior-anterior series and consecutive slides with adjacent sections. Slides were stained with tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:100, sc-14007 Santa-Cruz Biotechnologies) or alpha-synuclein (α-syn) monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:100, ab138501 Abcam). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300 Bio-Rad) and aminoethylcarbazone (AEC Kit, Sigma-Aldrich) as HRP chromogenic substrate were then used.

(2012). Briefly, mean gray values of stained and unstained (background) regions were calculated and converted to optical densities by applying the conversion formula in ImageJ (optical density = log10(255/mean gray value). Final optical densities were calculated as the difference in staining between stained and unstained regions. To ensure accuracy of the data, immunohistochemical procedures were simultaneously performed on each sample and all images captured by using Axiolab A1 Zeiss microscope connected to a digital camera (Axiocam ICC5) in the same conditions of bright field illumination and time of exposure.

14,results0,"To reproduce brain mitochondrial dysfunction, we treated mice once per 24 h with Rot for 28 days according to Inden et al. (2011). Treatment with the pesticide Rot in rodents inhibits mitochondrial complex I and induces striatal degeneration thus reproducing features of age-related neurological disorders such as PD and parkinsonisms . Furthermore, the Rot-treated mouse has been suggested to provide an interesting animal model for preclinical examinations of neuroprotective strategies . To evaluate the effects of IF, we compared Rot-treated (Rot) mice with a group of Rot-treated mice subjected to IF (Rot/IF). In line with other studies, Rot did not cause changes in body weight , whereas IF caused about 10% decrease of body weight that was comparable to that observed in Rot/IF-treated mice (Figure 1A). These findings are in line with previous works revealing the slimming effect of IF (Lettieri-Barbato et al.",4383d662-a9ac-48a1-87d5-1fc3222117c3

Bioclinical analyses reported in Table 1 revealed that all groups did not manifest metabolic alterations as assessed by analyzing fasting glycaemia, blood cholesterol and triglycerides. Also, the analysis of blood creatinine, creatine phospho kinase (CPK), alanine transaminase (ALT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) indicated that kidney, skeletal muscle and liver damage were not induced. The analysis of serum IGF-1 levels showed that they were decreased both in IF and Rot/IF groups with respect to Ctr and Rot groups (Table 1). This result confirmed the effectiveness of IF, as lowered IGF-1 levels are found upon different dietary restriction regimens in rodents and human (Mitchell et al., 2010; Lettieri-Barbato et al., 2016).

To assess the possible acquisition of motor dysfunction, we carried out an accelerating rotarod test. As reported in Figure 1B, IF did not lead to alteration in the motor function, while a significant decrease in the mouse ability to sustain the test was observed in Rot and Rot/IF group.

Rot treatment induced significant changes in the SN. Actually, we observed a decrease in the number of TH-positive neurons (Figures 2A,B) accompanied by a reduction in overall SN volume (Figure 2C) with respect to controls. Notably, this tissue damage was higher in Rot/IF with respect to Rot-treated mice (Figures 2A–C). Differently, IF did not induce changes in the number of TH-positive neurons and SN volume (Figures 2A–C). We also performed an immunohistochemistry determination of α-syn. According to the data obtained analyzing TH-positive neurons, we found that α-syn accumulation was well detectable in Rot-treated group and its immunoreactive levels were further increased when Rot was used in combination with IF (Figures 2A,D).

19,results6," Altered levels of excitatory amino acids characterize several neurodegenerative disorders including PD (Salińska et al., 2005; Blandini, 2010). Thus, we measured the levels of all the amino acids in the SN-enriched region of the brain.

22,discussion0,"In this work, we reproduced PD-like features through Rot treatment in mice and demonstrated that the concomitant administration of IF imposes significant metabolic alterations in SN-enriched regions that are associated with the aggravation of dopamine neuron degeneration as well as motor dysfunction.  Our results are in contrast with many others showing that dietary restriction exerts a neuroprotective function. In these studies, dietary restriction was applied for very long periods prior to a neurotoxic insult allowing the activation of neuronal stress responses that could mitigate the neurodegenerative processes. In particular, IF was found to protect hippocampal or dopaminergic neuron degeneration when applied prior excitotoxic insults or mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)) treatment in rodents (Bruce-Keller et al., 1999; Duan and Mattson, 1999).",7cc7c699-2b67-438b-b5f6-bf94183389b7
23,discussion1," Pre-treatment with dietary restriction was also found to protect dopaminergic neurons in a murine PD model using lactacystin . Attenuated motor deficits were observed in monkeys that were fed with 30% of calorie reduction for 6 months prior to treatment with methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) . The protective effects of dietary restriction have been ascribed to its ability to lower mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and raise antioxidant levels  or to enhance the production of neurotrophic factors (i.e., glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor) with consequent activation of neuroprotective signal transduction pathways in domaminergic neurons .  A study from the group of Armentero et al.",431fa2d3-ee24-4ca0-82f2-d1593be5c682
24,discussion2," (2008) showed that dietary restriction was instead not able to prevent the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rodents treated with the PD toxin 6-hydroxydopamine. These authors suggested that the lack of protection was due to the too short period of dietary restriction regimen preceding 6-hydroxydopamine treatment that did not allow the development of stress resistance signaling pathways.  To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first study investigating the effect of IF concomitant to an environmental insult and demonstrating a deleterious effect of IF. We show that even though IF lowers body weight and IGF-1 plasma levels, IF alone did not produce significant alterations in SN.",762bcc46-d1d6-4251-b6bb-c7fea80e0c15
25,discussion3," Intriguingly, when administered in combination with Rot treatment, IF leads to significant increase of excitatory amino acids as well as phospholipids levels in SN and exacerbates dopamine neurons degeneration, arguing that IF was likely unable to activate neuroprotective response against Rot toxicity.  The loss of dopamine due to the degeneration of the neurons in the SN elicits alterations of the neurotransmitter circuitry in the basal ganglia  and, as consequence, an imbalance of neurotransmission may develop in the nigrostriatal system (Cobb and Abercrombie, 2003; Bradner et al., 2013). Amino acids play an important role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters. When present at high levels in the brain they can be toxic to neurons, a phenomenon known as “excitotoxicity”.",db760393-d277-4fe5-943d-3bf942108114
26,discussion4," N-methyl-D-aspartate ionotropic glutamate receptor (N methyl D aspartate ionotropic glutamate receptor (NMDA)) is a ligand-gated ion channel that is crucial for excitatory neurotransmission and its excessive activation plays a key role in mediating some aspects of synaptic dysfunction in several neuronal disorders including PD (Lau and Tymianski, 2010). Increased excitatory neurotransmitters have been found in plasma and brain of PD patients and mice models . Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (Meldrum, 2000). Glutamine represents a precursor of the excitatory transmitter glutamate and aspartate (Holten and Gundersen, 2008).",6356a8ce-a4be-478c-9c0c-90053af8a5a1
27,discussion5," Glycine exerts excitatory effects in the cortex as well as hippocampal neurons by acting as a N methyl D aspartate ionotropic glutamate receptor (NMDA) receptor co-agonist increasing the affinity of N methyl D aspartate ionotropic glutamate receptor (NMDA) receptors for glutamate . With all this in mind, it is conceivable that the exacerbation of Rot-mediated neurodegeneration triggered by IF could at least in part depend on the increase of excitatory amino acids that we observed in SN.  Changes in the lipidome profile could occur in regions undergoing significant neuronal loss and inflammation. Actually, a number of phospholipids are involved in inflammatory cascades, and maintenance of phospholipids homeostasis is fundamental for assuring physiological function of cell membrane of brains cells (Posse de Chaves and Sipione, 2010; Aureli et al., 2015).",69976a26-ffbe-4120-8d4b-e29a8e858897
28,discussion6," In addition to the degeneration of dopaminergic system, gliosis is a prominent feature of PD (Członkowska and Kurkowska-Jastrzębska, 2011) that can be observed also in PD animal models . Our data suggest that IF worsens the harmful effects of Rot by favoring lipid membrane disturbances and raising the brain concentration of potentially inflammatory and neurotoxic phospholipids. In support of this assumption, elevated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were found to lead to brain injury  and are likely involved in the pathogenesis of PD . Furthermore, it has been reported that elevated lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels in the brain are potent attraction signals for phagocytes such as activated microglia, astroglia and macrophages .",22204ba3-3602-49fd-9227-d6138b29f1cb
29,discussion7," The increased levels of SM could imply a disruption of cell membranes, and in particular myelin composition, and a pro-inflammatory state. Interestingly, aberrant accumulation of sphingolipids in the prefontal cortex may also contribute to dysregulation of synaptic vesicle fusion and trafficking of N methyl D aspartate ionotropic glutamate receptor (NMDA) receptors , thus explaining the detected imbalance of excitatory amino acid profile.  The exact molecular mechanisms by which, in our model, IF sensitizes dopaminergic neurons to the toxic effects of Rot remain to be more deeply elucidated yet and are currently under investigation in our laboratory. A hypothetical explanation could be that upon fasting neurons have scarce levels of nutrients and the concomitant inhibition of complex I by Rot triggers a harmful energetic drop.",94ecd827-629a-41f1-955d-7a5ea35eac34
30,discussion8," It is now widely accepted that excessive N methyl D aspartate ionotropic glutamate receptor (NMDA) receptors stimulation aggravates PD via the enhancement of mitochondrial damage . An increase of inflammatory lipids could also contribute to damage mitochondria (Currais, 2015) and further create an energetic drop that sensitizes neurons to Rot upon IF. Based on this evidence, we can speculate that an increased death of dopaminergic neurons could be operative in Rot/IF group and at least in part due to an energetic crisis.",6c97461b-b340-40f0-991e-18c954e32933
31,discussion9,"  In conclusion, even though our results remain correlative, as we have not tested the level of astrocytes and microglia markers as well as dopaminergic neuron death, our work indicates that IF should not to be always considered of safe application but be followed with caution possibly only when external insults are limited; indeed, it may produce important side-effects, such as elevation of inflammatory lipids and excitatory amino acids levels that could exacerbate dopaminergic neurons degeneration and accelerate brain aging.
