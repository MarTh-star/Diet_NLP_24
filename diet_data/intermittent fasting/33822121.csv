0,background0, There is a dearth of studies on intermittent fasting in Saudi Arabia outside of Ramadan. The aim of this research was to study and describe the practice of intermittent fasting outside of Ramadan among Saudi people. ,d3211d32-85bd-4266-bdaf-cd851d8b17b6
1,methods0," Study design andsample  This cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted with Saudi adults who used social networks. The questionnaire link was publicized through social media (Twitter, WhatsApp, and Telegram), and responses were collected over 1 month. When participants accessed the web-based survey, they were greeted with the name and purpose of the study, as well as a statement about the anonymity and confidentiality of the information collected. Next, the screening criteria (18 years old or older, practicing intermittent fasting outside of Ramadan, etc.) were presented. If a participant met the criteria, s/he was directed to a statement of informed consent that asked them to check agree/disagree. Once a participant agreed to provide informed consent, s/he was able to complete the survey.  All information—from the study name to the final question—was presented textually.",ab6b64ce-e3d3-4e30-a7ff-108860093a36

Questionnaire development  Given the scarcity of descriptive studies on intermittent fasting practices, as noted by Cuccolo and colleagues [24], a questionnaire was developed with the aim of addressing this gap and to better understand intermittent fasting practices. The questionnaire was created after reviewing the existing literature. An examination of multiple sources yielded a pool of questions deemed relevant to the study goals [31, 35].  Regarding content validity, the questionnaire was sent to five health and academic professionals who had collectively published numerous studies that included survey-based research. Based on their recommendations, the survey was rewritten for clarity, relevance, and consistency.",4e93a558-4f2b-4983-8dea-5d52e71d0654

Sixty-one respondents reported information (age, height, etc.) that excluded them from the study. Even after identifying as Saudi, over 18 years of age, and practicing intermittent fasting outside of Ramadan, participants were asked in two later survey checkpoint questions if they 1) practiced intermittent fasting outside of Ramadan and 2) to report their specific age and height for the calculation of body mass index (body mass index (BMI)); 47 respondents reported that they did not practice intermittent fasting outside of Ramadan, which excluded them from the study, and ten respondents entered values for height or age that excluded them from the study. Ultimately, 514 respondents were selected for analysis, of which 11.9% (61/514) were male and 88.1% (453/514) were female.",7b06ee4d-74a1-4856-b022-767cad9b98d9

It was interesting to observe that 67.3% (346/514) of the respondents considered themselves to be in good or excellent health, and nearly the same percentage of respondents either reported themselves as being overweight or suffering from moderate or severe obesity, or were calculated as such based on their reported height and weight. These results are in agreement with findings from the Saudi National Survey, which showed that risk factors such as obesity were not associated with Saudis’ self-rated health [38].  The most prevalent medical conditions that the respondents reported were obesity (7.6%, 39/514), high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels (5.3%, 27/514), and hypothyroidism (2.3%, 12/514). A total of 30.5% (157/154) of the respondents had a body mass index (BMI) in the normal range, and 67.",0abf1bec-a23f-4262-bd4c-5566a3d513b9

Intermittent fasting for one to 3 months (25.5%) was the most prevalent duration, and a 12-h (26.3%, 135/514) fasting pattern was the second most prevalent pattern.  In terms of hydration during fasting, 88.3% (454/514) of the respondents kept themselves hydrated by drinking fluids during intermittent fasting. On the other hand, 11.7% (60/514) of the respondents did not drink any fluids for religious reasons (63.3%, 38/60), because they forgot to hydrate (11.6%, 7/60) and/or (25%, 15/60) or for other reasons such as sleep and laziness. The results related to intermittent fasting patterns, practices, and diets are shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1 Fasting practices among Saudi adults. A Fasting duration, B Fasting pattern, C Hydration status and D Diet. Data are represented as an overall percentage  It was noteworthy that among the respondents, the majority of Saudi adults did not follow any specific diet plan (58.2%, 299/514).",46a34524-4814-4b32-9f5b-54691e9453e0

The effect of fasting on state of health  To evaluate the full impact of intermittent fasting, weight loss was studied. The physical impact of intermittent fasting on eating habits, health status, and the changes felt by the participants were also studied. Most participants (62.5%, 321/514) reported consuming less food than usual. The eating habits of 34% (175/514) of the respondents were not changed. However, 18 (3.5%) participants responded that they ate more food than usual after intermittent fasting, and 60.7% (312/514) of the participants lost less than 5 kg after intermittent fasting (as shown in Table 3).Table 3 Impact of fasting on the participants’ health  Variables	Total	 After intermittent fasting, is the amount of food you eat:	  Less than usual	321 (62.5%)	  Unchanged	175 (34.",75688124-3e5d-4ee4-bd5a-d25b91d4d2b4

In terms of reported physical symptoms during intermittent fasting, 36.6% (188/514) of the participants did not experience any physical effects during intermittent fasting, and a small number (7.4%, 38/514) experienced hunger while practicing intermittent fasting.  Fasting goals and the use of technology  The primary goal of practicing intermittent fasting was to lose weight among 44.9% (231/514) of the respondents who reported that they wanted to lose some weight (as shown in Table 4). However, the rest of the respondents practiced intermittent fasting for multiple reasons, such as the optimization of health preservation and religious reasons. In addition, approximately 36.8% (189/514) of the participants were planning to continue practicing fasting until they reached their goals, and 21.",205bd356-1658-469f-9d38-a6270e8f3577
12,results8,"4% (110/514) planned to continue to practice intermittent fasting for the rest of their lives. It is possible that the simplicity of the intermittent fasting regimen—as well as the complex relationship among intermittent fasting, religious practices, health, weight goals, and lifestyle—may explain why more than one-fifth of the participants planned to continue intermittent fasting throughout their lives.Table 4 Knowledge about fasting goals and the use of technology among the study population  Variables	Total	 Why do you practice intermittent fasting?	  To lose weight	231 (44.9%)	  To be healthy	56 (10.9%)	  Religious reasons	36 (7.0%)	  Multiple reasons	172 (33.5%)	  Other	19 (3.7%)	 How long do you plan to continue to practice fasting?	   < 1 year	52 (10.1%)	   > 1 year	26 (5.1%)	  Until I reach my goals	189 (36.8%)	  For the rest of my life	110 (21.4%)	  I do not know	137 (26.7%)	 How did you learn about this practice of fasting?	  From a health program on TV	24 (4.",2cafe47b-a6c2-4468-850a-12ca4606c404

Most participants who used intermittent fasting management applications reported using the Zero app (35.4%, 28/79).  Body mass index (body mass index (BMI))  body mass index (BMI) is a metric used by clinicians and public health organizations in predicting and determining overweight and obesity (weight status category). In addition to self-reported weight change (or stasis), body mass index (BMI) was used for determining any post-intermittent fasting weight changes. Linear regression was used to determine the interaction between the fasting status and pattern and hydration status with body mass index (BMI) among the study population (F = 8.199, p < 0.001; adjusted R-Square = 0.040; as shown in Table 5). Approximately 4.0% of the variance in the body mass index (BMI) scores could be explained by the fasting status and pattern and hydration status of the participants.",28750e0e-d568-4e16-87c0-01ff11076020
15,results11," The findings show that the overall body mass index (BMI) status of the respondents was significantly (P < 0.05) affected by practicing intermittent fasting for a long period of time and by hydration status (P < 0.001 and 0.005, respectively).

18,discussion0," The study sought to explore intermittent fasting patterns among a sample of Saudis to better understand the practice of intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting has shown an increase in popularity as a method for weight loss and health optimization, and previous research has found promising results for its utility [39]. The current study collected data on intermittent fasting duration and habits, as well as health perceptions, and aggregated data exploring intermittent fasting trends and impacts. Unsurprisingly, although this study was not focused on sex, it should be noted that the majority of the participants were female; it is well known that males are less likely to participate in surveys [40, 41].  The results found in the present study align with the previous literature in a myriad of ways. Most participants (43.8%) reported that they followed a 16/8 fasting pattern, which is supported by a recent systematic review [30].",5e65b222-62e5-422b-8054-0e54ba9255eb
19,discussion1," Welton and colleagues reported that the ideal period of a fast for positive weight change appears to be 16 h [24, 30]; our results are in accordance with these findings and indicate that the optimum intermittent fasting period is already inherent to Saudi intermittent fasting practices. Furthermore, consistent with the findings of previous research that noted that long-term intermittent fasting and hydration with noncaloric beverages contributed to a reduction in body mass index (BMI) and stomach circumference [39], we observed that the overall body mass index (BMI) status of the respondents was significantly affected (P < 0.05) by the hydration status and duration of intermittent fasting. Finally, Haines [42] found, as the current study concluded, that at least 50% of participants planned to continue the practice of intermittent fasting for some duration beyond the time of the survey.",a36bb02e-5a20-42c5-8ffe-8a3fa448dd7a
20,discussion2,"  In terms of studies focused on intermittent fasting in Arabic-speaking countries, in another study on voluntary fasting in Saudi Arabia [43], survey participants identified that the most common reasons for fasting were weight loss (47.59%; 44.9% in our study). However, another study on intermittent fasting in Saudi Arabia [35] also found that intermittent fasting was “useful and effective for weight loss.” The same study also identified a predisposition toward using intermittent fasting as a culturally familiar weight-loss tool in the Middle East and noted that intermittent fasting “was prevalent among Arabs because of their habituation toward it.” In the present study, more than half of the participants reported that they lost less than 5 kg after intermittent fasting. It is well known that a weight loss of 5% is defined as clinically meaningful weight loss that lowers the risk of many diseases [44] and can be a measure of lifestyle weight-loss program efficacy [45].",50d27756-e411-4b62-adc2-c66e03071f58
21,discussion3,"  Sutton and colleagues [46] observed no significant change in self-reported hunger during a two- or four-week period of intermittent fasting. In another study [47], researchers noted a significant increase in participant hunger levels. However, our study found that after practicing intermittent fasting, the majority (75%) of the participants reported decreased hunger levels. A small number of our participants also reported other physical symptoms in response to intermittent fasting, such as headaches, dizziness, a sensation of being cold, and constipation after intermittent fasting.  Further clinical studies are warranted to assess the risks associated with long-term intermittent fasting, and factors such as protein malnutrition, vitamins, and mineral malnutrition should also be considered [48].",8ff61c5f-b4a2-403d-810f-40cc6c11cfbe
22,discussion4," It has been reported that long-term intermittent fasting could adversely affect health, and due to insufficient energy intake, it may cause potential side effects such as dizziness, nausea, headaches, weakness, and excessive hunger [48]. Therefore, studies on the short- and long-term physical symptoms related to intermittent fasting have shown mixed results and justify more research and discussion.  Although most participants learned about the practice of fasting through social networking sites, surprisingly, smartphone applications did not play a significant role in intermittent fasting management for Saudis. Given that Saudi Arabia has the most social network users in the Middle East and is ranked second worldwide in terms of the percentage of social media users [49], clinicians should consider using social networking as a public awareness and community health information tool.",6fed2cf3-ed78-4b0f-b688-4ed3f1d3925b
23,discussion5," A culturally adapted and religiously sensitive fasting application that is available in Arabic might attract more users from Arabic countries, particularly Saudi Arabia [50].  Study analyses have revealed that there is a relationship between hydration status and body mass index (BMI). Our finding was in agreement with a previous national survey of 9528 adults [51]  that also found a strong association between poor hydration levels and a higher body mass index (BMI). Another recent study among 8699 adults [52] from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey discovered a greater probability of hypohydration in participants with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2.  Our study revealed that the overall duration of intermittent fasting practices was significantly impacted by the sex and age of the participants. The results showed that women practiced longer periods of intermittent fasting than men.",0611cf6d-a50f-4d43-ad8d-6f397e778afc
24,discussion6," Additionally, the analyses pointed out that older respondents practiced longer periods of intermittent fasting than younger participants. In another study [53], researchers found a positive correlation between intermittent fasting and body composition in women aged 60 and older. Gupta & Singh [54], curiously, found that more men than women practiced intermittent fasting. Interestingly, contrary to our findings, they also observed that young adults practiced intermittent fasting more than middle-aged or older adults. Future research into sex, age, and intermittent fasting practices might help provide valuable insights into the sociodemographics of intermittent fasting practices and motivations.  The limitations of our study include the following. First, the use of purposive sampling was one of the study’s main limitations.",968a3375-cb23-4323-b5ba-b9e82eb3eff5
25,discussion7," Although this is a cost- and time-effective sampling strategy, its main limitation is that the results are not representative of the population and are not generalizable [55, 56]. Second, information bias, or reporting bias more specifically, may have negatively affected the accuracy of our survey, which was reliant on self-reported data. Self-reported data, such as weight loss and body mass index (BMI) data, might be biased and misreported. It is well documented [57] that self-reported body weight, for instance, is often underestimated. Additionally, because we could not independently verify participants’ self-reported values, self-reported bias must be considered. Third, 61 participants reported information that excluded them from the study, so this also limited the scope of the research and further limited any potential generalizability of the study. Fourth, the design of the Google Forms questionnaire did allow for the determination of a response rate.",216c3bae-2817-446d-85ee-523297c1f6c7
26,discussion8," Finally, because of time and financial considerations and COVID-19 restrictions, the study relied on single-mode online data collection. As such, we could not ensure that a wider pool of potential participants was reached through a variety of survey opportunities and data collection modes. Additionally, online data collection may be a barrier for individuals with physical or internet accessibility issues, those who are not on social media or infrequent users of social media. Therefore, selection bias occurred in this study and is one of the study’s limitations. To overcome the limitations encountered in the present study and to gain a more in-depth understanding of intermittent fasting practices, future research should consider qualitative approaches, such as participant focus groups and interviews, as well as mixed-mode or multimodal data collection methods, such as mail, phone, and online survey access.",4d27bd18-4e63-420c-a713-7d5c33019498
27,discussion9,"  Conclusion  This research sought to assess and better understand the Saudi practices of intermittent fasting outside of Ramadan, and hoped to continue the conversation on intermittent fasting practices. We discovered that most participants practiced intermittent fasting for a duration of less than 3 months. It was observed that 16-h intermittent fasting was the most common intermittent fasting practice among Saudi individuals. Additionally, weight loss was found to be the main purpose for practicing intermittent fasting. In fact, the data showed that intermittent fasting significantly reduced weight and body mass index (BMI) among participants who were practicing intermittent fasting for a long period of time, with or without hydration. Furthermore, our findings indicated that the majority of the participants were satisfied with the outcomes of their fasting practices and noted a general improvement in their health.",d4953232-9f2e-41b1-b1ca-884771e18db7
