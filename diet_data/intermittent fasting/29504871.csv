0,introduction0,"Stimulation of the peripheral immune system is known to bring along changes in brain function and behavior. One widely studied example in this context is the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP)) lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). When applied to the periphery, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) evokes an immune reaction by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is a subgroup member of pattern recognition receptors (pattern recognition receptors (PRR)) that are part of the innate immune system and contribute to the first-line immune response evoked by invading pathogens (Poltorak et al., 1998; Kawai and Akira, 2011). Alike most pattern recognition receptors (PRR)s, TLR4 is found on the surface of numerous immune cells, and its stimulation leads to elevated cytokine levels in the plasma of organisms exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Kawai and Akira, 2011). Furthermore, animals injected intraperitoneally (i.p.",89ba26c4-161e-49e4-823a-ef011a90f0f3
1,introduction1,") with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also show enhanced expression of cytokines within the brain and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)) axis as reflected by elevated circulating corticosterone (corticosterone (CORT)) levels (Lenczowski et al., 1997; Farzi et al., 2015b; Mayerhofer et al., 2017). These findings attest to a close immune synergy of the periphery and brain. While some of the changes observed in the brain are adaptive physiological processes that help the individual to overcome infection, in humans elevated cytokine levels as well as circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were found to correlate with symptoms of depression and anxiety .  There is increasing interest in how to interfere with undesired mirroring processes along the immune-brain-axis and to restrict the pro-inflammatory state within the periphery and brain.",6c884888-fe8d-4187-a0eb-365fb51c0484
2,introduction2," One novel approach is to subject rodents that are challenged by bacterial infection or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to a fasting regimen (Matsuzaki et al., 2001; Radler et al., 2014; Godinez-Victoria et al., 2014). It has been reported that a 50% calorie restriction suppresses sickness behavior in mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increases hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (neuropeptide Y (NPY)) mRNA expression, which has been indirectly correlated with a reduction of microglial activation . While these reports attest to beneficial effects of calorie restriction on the adverse effects of TLR4 stimulation by bacterial pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP)s, little is known about other pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP)s that stimulate distinct pattern recognition receptors (PRR)s and evoke expression of a different pattern of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",ece7bb07-f9c7-4f47-b803-a3c89312ae97
3,introduction3," Therefore, it was the overall aim of this study to evaluate whether sickness induced by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)] is mitigated by intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary regimen which allows ad libitum (AL) feeding every other day interrupted by 24 h periods without food. Poly(I:C) is a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule that activates the innate immune system in a similar manner as viral infection, stimulating TLR3 in certain immune cells, including myeloid dendritic cells and macrophages (Watanabe et al., 2011; Jensen and Thomsen, 2012). TLR3 is present in endosomal compartments, thus Poly(I:C) must be internalized to stimulate an immune response, which is thought to be mediated partly by CD14-dependent and clathrin-mediated mechanisms.",8030f1be-0978-4150-a204-4dfa0d99b164
4,introduction4," Following endocytosis, the synthetic dsRNA molecule binds to Mex3B which promotes the binding of Poly(I:C) to TLR3 and eventually causes downstream signaling, including upregulated expression of interferons (interferons (IFN)) of type I, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) .  The specific objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of a 9 days IF regimen on the effects of a sub-septic dose of i.p. administered Poly(I:C) (12 mg/kg) on cytokine, neuropeptide and neuroendocrine readouts in blood plasma and brain as well as on behavior of C57BL/6N mice. A particular advantage of IF is that mice maintain their overall food intake and body weight when compared to animals with food AL, while they enjoy the same health benefits seen in other fasting interventions like calorie restriction .",4d38893e-bf43-4bb0-9d31-fce8fa2f6a41
5,introduction5," First, the time course of the sickness response to Poly(I:C) was explored in a homecage-like environment to determine when the disturbances of locomotor, exploratory and ingestive behavior reach their maximum. The second experiment assessed whether IF might affect exploratory behavior of Poly(I:C) treated mice in the open field (OF) test at the time when sickness climaxes. Furthermore, we measured cytokine levels in blood plasma and pro-inflammatory cytokine and neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus. In addition, the activity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis was determined by measuring corticosterone (CORT) levels in the plasma.  ",907b8e8c-a1cf-4b21-a993-e984a9d317e6
6,methods0,"Experimental Animals Male C57BL/6N mice (n = 45), received from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) at the age of 8 weeks, were habituated to the new environment for at least one week before any intervention was undertaken. Tap water and standard laboratory chow were provided AL, unless stated otherwise. The animals were kept in groups of two under a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 h, lights off at 18:00 h). The room temperature was set at 22°C, and a relative air humidity of 50% was maintained. All housing conditions were tightly controlled.  Ethics Statement All experiments and the number of animals used were approved by an ethical committee at the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy of the Republic of Austria (BMWF-66010/0102-WF/V/3b/2017). The procedures were performed according to the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 (2010/63/EU).",ce17cc89-d404-4b31-b6b8-223f2bca5efd
7,methods1," Special care was taken and the experiments were designed in such a way that the suffering and the total number of animals used was minimized.  Reagents and Dosing The synthetic analog of dsRNA, Poly(I:C), was purchased from Invivogen (Toulouse, France, catalog number: tlrl-picw; free from microbial contaminants; low molecular weight: 0.2–1 kb). Poly(I:C) was dissolved in pyrogen-free sterile saline provided by Invivogen, as suggested by the manufacturer. Poly(I:C) and pyrogen-free sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) were injected i.p. at the same volume (10 μl/g body weight). For the induction of a TLR3 dependent sickness response in mice a dose of 12 mg/kg Poly(I:C) was chosen (Cunningham et al., 2007; Michalovicz and Konat, 2014).  Behavioral Testing Mice were habituated to the test room for at least 24 h (lights on at 6:00 h, lights off at 18:00 h, temperature set point 22°C, relative air humidity 50%, maximal light intensity 100 lux).",37ab1cc1-80d3-4cb5-81d7-2209e54bc4c6
8,methods2,"  LabMaster Test Locomotion, exploratory behavior as well as water and food intake of the test mice (aged 9–10 weeks) were continuously recorded in the homecage-like environment of the LabMaster system (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany), as described previously . In short, transparent LabMaster test cages (type III, 42.0 × 26.5 × 15.0 cm, length × width × height) were surrounded by two frames sending out infrared beams to measure vertical exploratory behavior (rearing) as well as horizontal locomotor activity by counts of infrared beam interruptions. The lower infrared frame was positioned 2.0 cm above the cage floor, while the upper frame was positioned at a distance of 4.3 cm above the lower one. Furthermore, two weight transducers attached to the cage lids were used to evaluate ingestive behavior, as a feeding bin, filled with standard rodent chow, and a drinking bottle were attached to the transducers throughout the experiment.",36a2d77a-0df6-4683-a73c-a6a470fffc3a
9,methods3," All recording devices were connected to a personal computer which was used to collect and analyze the data with the LabMaster software. Food and water intake was expressed in grams of food ingested per body weight (g/g) and milliliter of water ingested per body weight (ml/g), respectively. The animals were conditioned to the drinking bottles used in the LabMaster system and to single housing for at least 72 h before placing them in the test cages. Another habituation period of at least 24 h enabled the mice to get used to the LabMaster cages before the experiment was started. Within the LabMaster system, mice were kept one by one in order to enable accurate activity measurements of each mouse. All LabMaster parameters were recorded for 12 h after the injection of either saline or Poly(I:C). Injections were performed approximately 1 h before the dark-cycle began, at 17:00 h.",bfe2ff22-c836-48c3-af88-41fae45aebf7
10,methods4,"  Open Field (OF) Test The OF box (50 × 50 × 30 cm, length × width × height; opaque gray plastic) was illuminated by 35 lux at floor level . Mice (aged 11 weeks at the time of the OF test) were placed individually into one corner of the OF and their behavior was recorded and tracked by a video camera above the center of the OF (VideoMot2 software; TSE Systems). The OF box ground area was divided into a 36 × 36 cm central area, surrounded by the outer border zone, and mice were allowed to explore the new environment for 5 min. After each trial, the OF was cleaned with 70% ethanol, followed by water.  Experimental Protocols Two experiments were performed (Figure 1).

However, while some studies suggest that a restriction of calories might also ameliorate the sickness due to TLR4 stimulation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Inoue and Luheshi, 2010; MacDonald et al., 2011), this is the first study to assess the impact of IF on the peripheral and cerebral immune responses and behavioral manifestations due to TLR3 stimulation by the viral mimic Poly(I:C). We chose IF as the feeding intervention for the current study as it represents a milder form of fasting compared to calorie restriction .",b3fb473a-a60b-4108-a984-acec23fef213
30,discussion1," In this context it should be noted that rodents under calorie restriction are usually provided once daily with food containing a certain amount of calories and will additionally undergo a period of IF after finishing their meal, which exacerbates the fasting effect. In the present study the animals were subjected to a strict IF scheme for 9 days, and the interaction between IF and the Poly(I:C)-induced immune and sickness response was evaluated on the following day after withdrawal of food.  IF Exaggerates the Behavioral Sickness Response to Poly(I:C) The current data show that activation of the TLR3 pathway by i.p. administration of the dsRNA mimic Poly(I:C) (12 mg/kg) leads to a behavioral sickness response in the homecage-like environment of the LabMaster system. The signs of sickness observed in this system included a decrease in locomotor activity and exploratory rearing behavior, as well as a diminution of water and food intake.",d21e7dfb-b241-43b1-a239-f3b3608a2c84
31,discussion2," Taking all measurements into account, a clear sickness response was evident around 4–6 h post-injection, which is in line with several other reports that the same dose of Poly(I:C) causes a peak of sickness about 4 h following treatment (Cunningham et al., 2007; Michalovicz and Konat, 2014; Weintraub et al., 2014). For that reason, the impact of IF on the molecular and behavioral response to Poly(I:C) was further analyzed at this time point.  In contrast to the observations in the homecage-like LabMaster setting, i.p. Poly(I:C) alone failed to significantly alter exploratory behavior in the OF test 4 h post-injection. This is in line with previous reports showing stronger sickness behavior in the LabMaster compared to the OF (Farzi et al., 2015b). The OF test involves exposure of the animals to a novel environment and in this aspect differs markedly from the LabMaster setting in which the animals were allowed to habituate for at least 1 day.",5ac35b1d-c1b0-4182-a8f0-a4f20703bc1b
32,discussion3," We therefore suppose that the intrinsic motivation of mice to explore new environments may have overridden the obvious but moderate sickness response that was evident in the LabMaster system. We are affirmed in this conclusion by the observation that under IF conditions Poly(I:C) was able to induce particular signs of sickness behavior in the OF test along with distinct molecular perturbations in blood plasma and brain. At this point, it should be mentioned that IF itself did not notably influence the parameters under study and that mice maintained their overall body weight during IF, which has already been reported by others .  Unlike the beneficial effect of food restriction on the immune and sickness response to TLR4 stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), various molecular and behavioral effects of TLR3 stimulation by Poly(I:C) were exaggerated by IF.",e04a9495-c925-498d-a16a-8a6059f2c136
33,discussion4," On the basis of this unexpected outcome we propose that the metabolic effects of IF may be disadvantageous for particular neuroimmune processes. It might be the metabolic change that comes along with the withdrawal of food that amplifies the immune reaction and thereby evokes the behavioral changes seen. This is in line with work of Wang et al. (2016) who showed that a comparably high dose of Poly(I:C) (30 mg/kg) injected retro-orbitally followed by i.p. 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of glycolysis, was lethal in mice within a 24 h period after treatment, while mice in the control group co-injected with vehicle survived the Poly(I:C) challenge.",246ff11d-59ab-474b-9b4a-e48a447b48a5
34,discussion5," The adverse effect of Poly(I:C) in 2-DG-treated animals was not due to a difference in the inflammatory response (cytokine secretion) itself but due to impaired tolerance to viral inflammation by interference with the endoplasmatic reticulum stress response, which emphasizes the important role of the metabolic state of an organism in the face of viral insults . The current study is the first to report that fasting exaggerates the inflammatory response to Poly(I:C) challenge, as reflected by an increase of peripherally secreted cytokines, which may explain the aggravated sickness response to TLR3 stimulation following IF.",efb8976b-e947-4a92-8896-38ff54a6d2a9
35,discussion6,"  Elevated Cytokine Expression in the Periphery as a Mechanism Behind the Amplified Sickness Behavior in IF Mice One major route of communication between the peripheral immune system and the brain are circulating cytokines that either directly enter the brain via areas such as the circumventricular organs that have a more permissive blood-brain-barrier or stimulate specific receptors at the peripheral fibers of the vagus nerve, both leading to a transfer of the pro-inflammatory stimulus to the brain . In order to assess possible mediators of the IF-induced exacerbation of Poly(I:C)-evoked sickness behavior, both circulating cytokines as well as cytokine mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, a brain region involved in both energy balance and central response to peripheral inflammation , were evaluated.",98f232bf-0bd5-4a18-82c3-00b722f7a8a1
36,discussion7,"  The overall circulating cytokine levels measured in the AL + Poly(I:C) group were lower than the concentrations found in other studies using the same dose of Poly(I:C) (Cunningham et al., 2007; Weintraub et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2015). Apart from assay type and sensitivity, these differences may be due to the purity of Poly(I:C) (i.e., absence of endotoxin), length of the dsRNA molecule used, time of analysis post-injection, and differences in the experimental animals (e.g., strain, sex, housing) (Kato et al., 2008; Michalovicz and Konat, 2014; Murray et al., 2015; Mayerhofer et al., 2017).  The ability of IF to exaggerate the immune response to peripheral TLR3 stimulation is highlighted by the observed elevation of circulating cytokines. Most strikingly, only mice that were both fasted and injected with Poly(I:C) showed a significant increase in TNF-α, IL-6, and interferons (IFN)-α levels when compared to vehicle-treated controls.",5b611806-3602-459a-ab2b-3d61779a8f78
37,discussion8," In fact, one key mechanism of the exacerbated sickness response to Poly(I:C) by IF might be the enhanced release of TNF-α, since circulating TNF-α is known to be a crucial mediator in the mirroring of pro-inflammatory signals from the periphery to the brain (Bluthé et al., 2000a; D’Mello et al., 2009). Hence, this cytokine is very likely to contribute to the augmented behavioral sickness response in the IF group. The inability of Poly(I:C) alone to significantly elevate plasma TNF-α might be a factor explaining the absence of an overt sickness behavior in the novel environment of the OF. Furthermore, the enhanced secretion of IL-6 and interferons (IFN)-α in the Poly(I:C)-treated IF group found in the current study could explain the advanced sickness response. IL-6 is known to be required for the manifestation of behavioral responses to systemic immune stimulation, and interferons (IFN)-α in concert with IL-6 is thought to additively induce hypoactivity (Bluthé et al.",33702b4b-678e-4c8f-9bcd-c609ba8b8880
38,discussion9,", 2000b; Murray et al., 2015).  Additionally, interferons (IFN)-γ and MCP-1 levels were elevated significantly only in IF mice treated with the dsRNA mimic. Although interferons (IFN)-γ alone is not likely to induce a strong sickness response, it is believed to play a role in maintaining the expression of other cytokines in chronic stress models (Litteljohn et al., 2010; McCusker and Kelley, 2013). interferons (IFN)-γ may therefore be another factor of relevance, especially in view of the mild stress that is likely to occur with IF.  The IF-related boost of the overall cytokine response to Poly(I:C) included the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which is in line with a similar increase in circulating IL-10 levels 4 h following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to calorie-restricted rats  and might reflect an attempt to limit excessive inflammation.",53a098bf-0684-49fb-947a-0da81255a64e
39,discussion10," IL-10 is an important immunoregulatory factor as it is known to inhibit the TLR4-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β (Fiorentino et al., 1991; Grutz, 2005). The present findings indicate that TLR3 activation triggers a similar mechanism orchestrating the overall immune response.  Moreover, plasma interferons (IFN)-β was increased to a lesser extent than in other studies following treatment with the same Poly(I:C) dose . This discrepancy is difficult to disentangle because the size and structure of the dsRNA molecule used are not specified in detail and because female mice were used.  Given the inefficacy of IF to impact the Poly(I:C)-induced cerebral cytokine mRNA expression, our results suggest that the circulating cytokine levels enhanced by IF have a bigger influence on the exacerbated behavioral sickness response to Poly(I:C) as compared to central cytokine expression.",35e35f48-e337-4297-9b10-75279f140aaf
40,discussion11," In the hypothalamus we quantitated cytokine expression only at the mRNA level for three reasons. First, the assay of cytokine mRNA in the brain enabled us to measure cerebral cytokine expression independently of any cytokines that have entered the brain via the circulation. Second, quantitation of cytokine mRNA reflects the dynamic process of gene transcription  at the peak of the behavioral response to Poly(I:C). Measurement of cytokine mRNAs in the brain has also been the preferred method to characterize the neuroinflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Turrin et al., 2001; Bay-Richter et al., 2011). Third, previous work in the authors’ laboratory has shown that the pattern of cerebral cytokine expression 3 h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment is similar at the mRNA and protein level although the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response is more sensitively mirrored by mRNA than protein changes (Farzi, 2015).",ea4d8764-344d-4f57-80e1-9bc2e6f4765a
41,discussion12,"  corticosterone (CORT) Is Elevated in IF Animals, but Does Not Influence the Cytokine Response to Poly(I:C) The IF regimen markedly enhanced the corticosterone (CORT) levels in the plasma of vehicle-treated mice, which is in accordance with other reports in rodents showing that circulating corticosterone (CORT) rises both after a brief fasting episode as well as calorie restriction over short or long periods (Wan et al., 2003; Lowette et al., 2014; MacDonald et al., 2014). Although the Poly(I:C)-treated IF group presented with significantly enhanced plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels, the IF-related change in glucocorticoid secretion did not influence the pro-inflammatory effect of the dsRNA mimic.",aff3faa0-56d4-4d74-bfc8-cebcc2edf234
42,discussion13," By inference, the immune response to TLR3 stimulation seems to be less sensitive to glucocorticoid inhibition than the response to TLR4 stimulation, given that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and sickness are thought to be blunted by calorie restriction through stimulation of corticosterone (CORT) secretion . Subsequently, the elevated corticosterone (CORT) levels caused by metabolic stress due to IF might contribute to a bouquet of effects of the viral mimic in the central nervous system. Of note, IF animals treated with Poly(I:C) presented with lower corticosterone (CORT) levels than vehicle-injected IF mice, which suggests that Poly(I:C) might dampen the IF-stimulated hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis.",5de3ba9a-4d92-43e2-b4b5-96dc6aa073cf
43,discussion14," A similar observation was made in a study of bacterial infection in which lower corticosterone (CORT) levels were found in IF mice after Salmonella typhimurium infection than in non-infected mice (Godinez-Victoria et al., 2014). This might reflect a negative feedback mechanism instigated by IF, blunting the release of corticosterone (CORT) and its effect on the central nervous system .  Elevated neuropeptide Y (NPY) Levels in the Hypothalamus Do Not Abate Sickness in IF Mice Treated With Poly(I:C) The orexigenic neuropeptide neuropeptide Y (NPY) is expressed throughout the peripheral and central nervous system and thought to protect against behavioral disturbances in response to immune challenge (Ferreira et al., 2011, 2012; Farzi et al., 2015a; Radler et al., 2015). In line with other reports (White and Kershaw, 1990; Chua et al., 1991; Marks et al., 1992; Gotthardt et al.",6b513691-21cb-44d1-b130-0771b43553d4
44,discussion15,", 2016), IF significantly increased neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the hypothalamus. Unlike immune stimulation by bacteria-derived components (Freund’s adjuvant, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), which impacts the cerebral neuropeptide Y (NPY) system , Poly(I:C) failed to significantly boost hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression. It has been proposed that the effect of fasting to attenuate TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide (LPS))-mediated microglial activation may indirectly be due to neuropeptide Y (NPY) induction in the brain . In the present study, however, the IF-evoked elevation of neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the hypothalamus failed to suppress the sickness response to TLR3 stimulation. Whether neuropeptide Y (NPY) is indeed unable to blunt Poly(I:C)-induced sickness behavior awaits to be explored by the use of neuropeptide Y (NPY) antagonism or deletion.",b65ce3a8-ccdc-48f5-85bd-655367e52f46
45,discussion16,"  Nevertheless, neuropeptide Y (NPY) may differentially affect TLR3- and TLR4-mediated disturbances of brain function and behavior, as there are some distinct differences in the mechanisms whereby Poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce immune responses and behavioral changes (Hopwood et al., 2009; Kong et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). Thus, i.p. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is thought to enter the circulation and subsequently to access various peripheral and central sites of action including the blood-brain-barrier and cells of the circumventricular organs . Poly(I:C), on the other hand, is readily degraded by ubiquitous RNases and therefore will only activate TLR3 present at the site of injection (Lenczowski et al., 1997; Romanovsky et al., 2000; Konat, 2016).",4432609f-802e-4820-b5f2-910f9355fb7d
46,discussion17," As a consequence, peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly(I:C) take different routes to signal to the brain, which is likely to explain why bacterial and viral immune stimulants act on different brain regions . Finally, glucose deprivation is known to differentially influence immune stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly(I:C) and has beneficial effects during bacterial, but deleterious consequences during viral, inflammation .  Conclusion Taken together, this study shows that (I) the TLR3 stimulant Poly(I:C), given i.p., induces a sickness response attenuating physical activity and ingestive behavior in a homecage environment 4–6 h post-injection. (II) TLR3 signaling causes peripheral secretion and hypothalamic expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (III) IF exacerbates the effects of Poly(I:C) to stimulate peripheral cytokine expression and the sickness response.",8c10c783-afcc-4b68-bb30-08cb1c0465ad
47,discussion18," (IV) This fasting regimen enhances the plasma levels of corticosterone (CORT) and the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hypothalamus, but these molecular reactions do not prevent the immune and behavioral responses to TLR3 stimulation. Collectively, our findings highlight an adverse influence of IF on TLR3-mediated immune stimulation and sickness behavior which is likely mediated by the boost in peripheral cytokine levels.
