0,methods0,"4.1. Cell Culture Human Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) cells were obtained from Prof. Dr. M. Wabitsch (University of Ulm, Germany) [12]. Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) pre-adipocytes were cultured in 6-well plates (Corning, Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) with Gibco™ Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12, 1:1) media supplemented with 66 mmol/L biotin, 34 mmol/L D-pantothenate, 10% fetal calf serum (Bodinco BV, Alkmaar, The Netherlands) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands) as described before [17]. Differentiation started once pre-adipocytes reached 90% confluence.",0ca9f740-134e-4eef-b6a6-c71176af5196
1,methods1," During two weeks of differentiation (T0–T14), Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) cells first went through four days with quick differentiation medium (serum-free DMEM/F12 medium containing 2 mg/mL human transferrin, 200 µmol/L human insulin, 5 mmol/L Cortisol, 20 µmol/L triiodothyronine, 1 mmol/L 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 5 mmol/L rosigilitazone). The other 10 days cells remained in 3FC medium (serum-free DMEM/F12 medium containing 2 mg/mL human transferrin, 200 µmol/L human insulin, 5 mmol/L Cortisol, 20 µmol/L triiodothyronine) as described before [17]. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) unless otherwise stated.  For GR, mature adipocytes on day 14 (T14) were cultured in basic DMEM/F12 medium (without glucose and phenol red (Cell Culture Technologies, Gravesano, Switzerland)), supplemented with 20 nmol/L human insulin and 0.1 mmol/L D-glucose for 96 h (T18GR).",19707ae7-2d9a-44af-9f98-ef618772da1b
2,methods2," As the feeding control, mature adipocytes at T14 originating from the same pre-adipocytes were cultured for 96 h in NF medium (T18): DMEM/F12 medium without glucose and phenol red, but supplemented with 20 nmol/L human insulin and 17.5 mmol/L D-glucose.  For RF, after 96 h of GR, the cells were transferred to DMEM/F12 medium without glucose and phenol red (Cell Culture Technologies) but supplemented with 20 nmol/L human insulin and 17.5 mmol/L D-glucose for another 96 h (T22RF). From T14 onwards, the medium was gently refreshed every second day. Figure 3 provides an overview of the experimental approach.  4.2. Collection of Secretion Medium In order to avoid interference of phenol red with MS, for collecting the secretome at T14, adipocyte medium was changed to collection medium: basal medium (DMEM/F12 (1:1) without glucose and phenol red (Cell Culture Technologies, Gravesano, Switzerland)), supplemented with 20 nmol/L human insulin and 17.5 mmol/L glucose for 48 h (T12–T14).",c1ce9cd4-40ab-4adb-bb5d-37a182627e27
3,methods3," The collection medium at T14 was collected in a separate vial for each well. For NF, GR and RF, the medium was already without phenol red from T14 onwards. To collect the secretome after NF, GR and RF, the medium was collected at day 18 (T18 and T18GR) and day 22 (T22RF) from each well separately. The collected medium (4 mL per well) was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min (Universal 30 RF, Hettich Benelux B.V., The Netherlands). Thereafter, the supernatant was gently moved to a new tube. The whole experiment was performed three times with triplicate samples. The first time the experiment was performed, the triplicate medium samples per time point were pooled to serve proper protocol assessment. For the second and third time that the experiment was performed, the triplicate samples were kept separately. This provided seven replicate samples per time point with in total 28 samples. These were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis.  4.3.",3d92ef87-f5f9-41f5-913d-e67ba977cce8
4,methods4," Sample Preparation All samples were treated similarly according to the FASP protocol as described by Wisniewski et al. [80]. In short, after thawing and brief vortexing, the medium of each vial was added to a pre-rinsed filter device (Amicon® Ultra−4 Centrifugal Filter Units, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), centrifuged at 4000× g at 20 °C for 30 min. The fluid was discarded and the concentrated protein sample on the filter was washed with 3.5 mL 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate and centrifuged at 4000× g at 20 °C for 30 min. For reduction, 15 µL of 200 mmol/L dithiothreitol was added and the filter was incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Next, to accomplish alkylation 18 µL of 400 mmol/L iodoacetamide solution was added and the filter was incubated at room temperature in the darkness for another 45 min. To stop the alkylation, 30 µL of 200 mmol/L dithiothreitol was added and the filter was incubated at room temperature for 45 min.",f2ae6666-c841-4b7a-8fb3-01fa34090503
5,methods5,"  The alkylated protein sample on the filter was washed with 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate at 4000× g at 20 °C for 40 min. To each concentrated protein sample 3 µg trypsin/Lys-C Mix was added, and after gentle mixing the filter device was incubated at 37 °C overnight. Peptide concentration was measured by the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay according to the manufacture’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific (#: 23275), Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). Then, digested peptides were diluted to the same final concentration of 0.25 μg/μL by 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate.  4.4.",26f15b4c-b41e-4353-9a8d-6b6827e9325d
6,methods6," Label-Free Protein Identification and Quantification The mass analysis was performed using a nanoflow HPLC instrument (Dionex ultimate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands), which was coupled on-line to a Q Exactive mass-spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands) with a nano-electrospray Flex ion source (Proxeon, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). An equal amount of Pierce Digestion Indicator peptides was added to all peptide samples as internal standard. 5 μL of this mixture was loaded onto a C18-reversed phase column (Acclaim PepMap C18 column, 75 μm inner diameter × 15 cm, 2 μm particle size, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). The peptides were separated with a linear gradient of 4–68% buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.08% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min for 120 min.",928b4b35-185b-46fe-9cf6-2394f460b6f9
7,methods7,"  MS data were acquired using a data-dependent top-10 method, dynamically choosing the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (280–1400 m/z) in positive mode. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 and a maximum injection time of 120 ms. The dynamic exclusion duration was 30 s. Isolation of precursors was performed with a 1.8 m/z window and a maximum injection time of 200 ms. The resolution for HCD spectra was set to 17,500 and the normalized collision energy was 30 eV. The under-fill ratio was defined as 1.0%. The instrument was run with peptide recognition mode enabled, but exclusion of singly charged and charge states of more than five. The entire experiment was repeated three times.  4.5. Database Search and Quantification The MS data were searched using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 Sequest HT search engine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands) based on the UniProt human database [81]. The false discovery rate was set to 0.",519d8299-8c0a-4ed1-b030-8b3efe7aa02a
8,methods8,"01 for proteins and peptides, which had to have a minimum length of six amino acids. The precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm and the fragment tolerance at 0.02 Da. One miss-cleavage was tolerated, oxidation of methionine was set as a dynamic modification as well as carbamidomethylation of cysteines. Label free quantitation was conducted using the Minora Feature Detector node in the processing step and the Feature Mapper node combined with the Precursor Ions Quantifier node in the consensus step with default settings within Proteome Discoverer 2.2.  4.6. Data Normalization The LC-MS-analysis was done in seven runs, each run containing a sample from each time point (T14, T18, T18GR and T22RF). Data normalization was done in two steps.  First, to correct data for possible differences between runs, we chose the 426 proteins, which were present in all of the test samples.",296509e1-54d3-473d-9462-b2754d9b9f47
9,methods9," We calculated the mean abundance of those 426 proteins in all seven runs (M) and mean abundance of those 426 proteins per run (mx for run x). Normalization factor 1 for run x (f1x) = M ÷ mx. Data were firstly corrected (D1) as follows: D1 = f1x × original tested protein abundance in run x.  Additionally, the Pierce Indicator added to each sample was normalized by f1. The second normalization was then performed to stratify the protein abundances according to the Pierce Indicator. Normalization factor 2 for sample y (f2y) = Pierce’s mean abundance from all 28 samples ÷ Pierce abundance in sample y. In general, the second normalization step was: D2 = f2 × D1. More specifically, the abundance of a protein in sample y of run x was normalized as f1x × f2y × original tested protein abundance.  4.7.",db40235f-260e-43ee-b1ca-49959cc05bef
10,methods10," Validation of Secreted Proteins and Imputation of Missing Values To verify the secreted nature of the identified proteins, their amino acid sequences were obtained from UniProt and analyzed with SignalP and Deeploc. SignalP 4.1 Server [46,82] was used to recognize classical secreted proteins by the fact that they contain a signal peptide for secretion, Deeploc−1.0 [49] was used for prediction of the subcellular localization by creating a recurrent neural network relying on protein sequence information per se. Proteins containing a signal peptide or located in the extracellular space were chosen as secreted proteins for further analysis.  Performing LC-MS analysis of proteins, values could be missing for various reasons [83]. When per time point three or less of the seven samples had missing values, the Multiple Imputation routine of SPSS was used to impute those values.",c293fe6e-3604-4422-a8a2-2ed78b60d398
11,methods11," Finally, only proteins recognized as secreted and with no more than three missing values were used for further analysis.  4.8. Statistical Analysis Data were described as mean ± SEM, variable abundances were log2-transformed. To determine possible effects over time between NF and RF after GR, two-tailed dependent T-test was carried out with a cut-off for significance of p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 22.0 Chicago, Illinois, USA). Fold changes (FC) from T18 to T22RF were calculated as follows: FC = 2 (log2 T22RF − log2 T18).  5. Conclusions In summary, in this study we reported for the first time 94 proteins being secreted by adipocytes. In addition, our in vitro study demonstrated that GR followed by return to NF leads to changes in the secretome of adipocytes in comparison with NF alone.",3d6d90f9-750c-4b5f-914c-e1e9ff02733c
