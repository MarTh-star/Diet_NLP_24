6,discussion0," This RCT shows that the 5:2 diet can be a non-pharmacological tool in the management of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by improving not only specific markers of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) but also several cardiometabolic parameters. More specifically, we demonstrated significant reductions in body weight, body mass index (BMI), WC, body fat, ALT, aspartate transaminase (AST), fibrosis and steatosis scores, TG, hs-CRP (mg/L), and CK-18 (ng/ml) after 12 weeks on the 5:2 diet. On the other hand, the 5:2 diet did not alter the levels of HDL-C, TC, LDL-C, glycemic markers (FBS, insulin, and HOMA-IR), and total antioxidant capacity. Taken together, these results are in line with our hypothesis, given that we expected some improvements in cardiometabolic and hepatic markers with accompanying weight loss and decreased adiposity. So much so that massive research shows beneficial effects of different IF regimens in this regard (31–37).",caf933d2-58bc-42d5-b833-c3432bebdff2
7,discussion1,"  Different types of IF regimens have been used to improve body composition and anthropometric indices in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), from the Ramadan fasting to the 5:2 diet. Ramadan is a type of IF regimen that can reduce body weight, body fat, body mass index (BMI), and WC in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) compared to non-fasting (38), but, overall, our results tend to be better due to the longer length of intervention since Ramadan lasts approximately 4 weeks. Our findings are more similar to the study by Holmer et al. (7), who performed an RCT for patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n = 74) and observed a decrease in body weight by 7.4 kg and in body mass index (BMI) by 2.4 kg/m2 over a 12-week period on a 5:2 diet, whose effect was similar to a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet and better than a standard of care (7). We observed a lower decrease in body weight (−3.7 kg) and body mass index (BMI) (−1.",efbd1edb-89da-45c9-86c4-642a080f7de0
8,discussion2,"3 kg/m2) lower than in the study by Holmer et al. This was probably because there was a mean reduction of 590 kcal/d at the end of the study by Holmer et al., whereas we observed a mean reduction of 260 kcal. It must be noted that Holmer et al. prescribed the 5:2 diet, guiding a daily intake of 500 kcal for 2 non-consecutive days a week, followed by a general recommendation based on an intake limit of 2,000 kcal/d for women and 2,400 kcal/d for men, while we estimated the patients' basal metabolic rate using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation and, therefore, providing more reliable data in terms of individual care. Moreover, we observed reductions in WC (−3 cm) and fat mass (−2.8 kg), while, seemingly, Holmer et al. did not assess these parameters.  It is important to note that both the intervention and control groups had a significant decrease in total energy intake compared to the baseline (the intervention group: ~2,863– ~ 2,602 kcal/day, p < 0.",1cb19c66-e698-460a-8c5c-bba228fd84f8
9,discussion3,"001; the control group: ~3,121–2,967 kcal/day, p = 0.001), but without the inter group differences (p < 0.05). In summary, there was a modest reduction in calorie intake in both groups (261 kcal and 154 kcal for intervention and control groups, respectively). Although the control group was instructed to consume the habitual diet, there was a reduction in calorie intake that probably may have occurred because the participants were part of a clinical study. However, reduced calorie intake on the 5:2 diet had a greater clinical magnitude than the control group regardless of the absence of significant intergroup difference, as the 5:2 diet was more effective in improving body composition and laboratory parameters. It is crucial to highlight that we adjusted the intergroup variables at the end of the study for body mass index (BMI), body weight, WC, and energy intake.",178efc9c-ed9c-40ae-93e3-e1eb7d54c40f
10,discussion4,"  Reducing energy intake can be considered the main mechanism leading to improvement in adiposity parameters and cardiometabolic markers (38). Decreased energy intake within an IF diet plan may promote mobilization of free fatty acids, increase fat oxidation and production of ketones, as well as can improve circadian rhythm by modulating clock genes and anti-inflammatory molecules with a myriad of metabolic improvements (e.g., melatonin) when the dietary strategy creates a health routine for the subject (39–43). Regarding the molecular basis involving the interplay between liver and lipids, Santos and Macedo suggest that IF reduces the production of apolipoprotein B and thereby increases fatty acid oxidation and decreases hepatic TG content, yielding a reduction in circulating levels of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C, and small-dense LDL-C (44).",6389b8bf-20de-40ae-a810-364a4a2c4ce2
11,discussion5," The latter parameter shed light on the anti-atherogenic effects of IF diets, as the small-dense LDL-C represents the LDL particles with highest affinity for arterial damage (45). In contrast, there is a debate about the effects of IF regimens on improving lipid indices, as discussed thoroughly below.  Employing an alternate-day fasting, i.e., alternating between an ad libitum feeding day and a 75% energy-restricted fasting day, Cai et al. (46) found improvement in TC and TG within a relatively short length of intervention (4–12 weeks) in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but LDL-C and HDL-C levels did not change (46). Holmer et al. found a decrease in TG, TC, and LDL-C levels by 35, 19, and 14 mg/dL, respectively, in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) undergoing a 5:2 diet for 12 weeks, while HDL-C did not alter (7). In our study, we found a decrease in TG (~43 mg/dL), with a clinical magnitude similar to the reduction by Holmer et al.",d7083890-ec5c-4e90-b2af-7682ea601264
12,discussion6,", but we did not observe changes in other lipid parameters.  In patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver tests (ALT, aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and GGT) are routinely included in the clinical evaluation. We demonstrated a decrease in ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels by 13 and 8 U/L, respectively, after the diet 5:2. Johari et al. (47), in turn, found a decrease in ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels by 25 and 8 U/L, respectively, in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) after 8 weeks of alternate-day calorie restriction (47). The authors explained this reduction in liver enzymes by the improvement of visceral fat or steatosis in the liver (47). Likewise, we demonstrated improvement in steatosis and fibrosis scores alongside a decrease in GGT levels (~11 U/L).",9c5fe0e2-12fd-4f1b-b66e-5814c0af2c53
13,discussion7," Collectively, these results can be considered the central tenet of our research, as the primary goal of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) treatment is to improve specific parameters of this ailment, which is secondarily associated with several metabolic benefits.  Increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) might affect the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. CRP is a protein produced by the liver under stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the hs-CRP assay is a recommended marker of low-grade inflammation for screening the risk of cardiovascular diseases (48–50). It is no wonder that hs-CRP is a non-invasive complementary marker of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its high levels are common in this population due to the interplay between fatty liver and cardiometabolic problems (51). Aliasghari et al. (38) reported decreased levels of hs-CRP after Ramadan fasting (38).",df6c722f-3946-43da-98de-7f897b228621
14,discussion8," In our research, the group that underwent a 5:2 diet had lower levels of hs-CRP at the end of the study both compared to the baseline (−0.6 mg/L) and end levels of the control group (−0.4 mg/L). CK-18 is another inflammatory marker that circulates as a consequence of oxidative stress, hepatocyte apoptosis, or inflammation in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (52). In a meta-analysis, CK-18 levels proved to be an important tool for diagnosing non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (52), and, in our work, we showed a reduction in CK-18 levels after the 5:2 diet. The reduction in CK-18 levels after the 5:2 diet is not impressive, but, at least, it has a modest clinical magnitude, as we observed a reduction from ~13.2 to 11.9 ng/ml, and a proposed CK-18 cutoff value to detect steatosis (S ≥ 2) in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is 11.7 ng/ml (53).",b81556dc-1c91-43a9-b781-4b2fc0c848a4
15,discussion9,"  Recently, in 2022, IF has been highlighted as a safe and effective tool to improve liver histology in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (54). Behind the scenes of histology, fasting-induced AMP-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) is the main biological rationale in this regard, whose enzyme is a master regulator of energy metabolism that activates fatty acid oxidation and breakdown (54), but it is crucial to know that this mechanism is enhanced by carbohydrate restriction and mainly by skeletal muscle contraction during exercise (55). Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis are two of the most studied histological parameters due to their importance in disease diagnosis and staging (56). In patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), excess visceral fat lipids and accompanying inflammation sharply increase the risk of developing complications of chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (57).",416fba2d-6edc-4a46-aaa8-2c3053811ae9
16,discussion10," Advanced fibrosis is the most significant predictor of mortality in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (58). In our study, since 5:2 was associated with improved fibrosis and steatosis scores, we provide evidence that such a dietary regimen is a viable non-pharmacological strategy to improve key clinical parameters that are a result of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathology, but RCTs performing liver biopsies are needed to analyze the non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) histology.  Type 2 diabetes is a recognized risk factor in the non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) severity (59). Patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who underwent Ramadan fasting had reduced FBS, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels but not in the non-fasting group (38). Overall, in a meta-analysis consisting of 12 articles (545 participants), IF diets were associated with a significant decline in FBS (weighted mean difference, −4.16 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, −6.92– −1.",e442e696-39f3-4cda-ab89-95c9a142be77
17,discussion11,"40) when compared with a control diet (60). In our study, we did not find significant changes in FBS, insulin, and HOMA-IR. These null effects may be a result of many patients in our sample being normoglycemic, but mean FBS levels were within the range of pre-diabetes, and this fact cannot be ruled out. At best, there was a non-statistical decrease in FBS by ~5 mg/dl after the 5:2 diet that nearly corrected mean FBS levels from the pre-diabetic stage to normoglycemia (from ~106 to ~101 mg/dl).  Current guidelines suggest that dietary intervention and exercise are first-line therapy for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (61, 62). Correspondingly, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)) guidelines focus on lifestyle changes through diet and habitual physical activity and emphasize that diet-induced weight loss is the only treatment to ameliorate liver damage without severe liver fibrosis (63).",8c48bdff-e703-4aa8-9d30-752f5246a414
18,discussion12," Given that these guidelines recommend a pragmatic and individualized approach and do not advocate any specific diet for the treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), our findings are noteworthy as a means of expanding the effect of IF regimens as one of many dietary strategies that can be employed through a personalized perspective, but this does not imply that IF is the best dietary approach. Bearing in mind the importance of personalized dietary plans, the addition of functional foods and supplements could also enhance the effect of IF or other dietary patterns in the management of liver parameters and cardiometabolic markers (64–70).  As for strengths, our data reach different spheres of medicine, as we observed improvement in several laboratory markers with clinical relevance.",c3c6c6ec-51a4-48f5-92df-c9966a5c6642
19,discussion13," For instance, (i) ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) are biomarkers for screening liver function; (ii) fibrosis and steatosis are important determinants of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosis (71); (iii) associated atherogenic dyslipidemia is often observed with increased plasma levels of TG in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of mortality in this population (72); (iv) hs-CRP is recommended for coronary risk assessment in adults and is significantly higher in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (51); (v) CK-18 (ng/ml) is one of the biomarkers in the circulation as a result of oxidative stress, hepatocyte apoptosis, or inflammation in response to lipid metabolism disorders because of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (52).",d60018b8-8a0f-4795-9031-3e0e55d208cd
20,discussion14," In addition, we assessed body composition alongside anthropometric indicators of obesity that is easily replicated in clinical practice and used in nutrition science (73–76).  As for limitations, we did not use gold-standard methods for body composition and energy expenditure nor did we perform liver biopsies. In addition, we used a physical activity questionnaire to assess physical activity. Ultimately, we encourage further research focusing on non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and accompanying diseases, such as dyslipidemia and diabetes, to better expand the clinical magnitude of the 5:2 diet and other types of IF regimens.  Conclusion  The 5:2 diet can reduce weight loss and related parameters (fat mass and anthropometric indicators of obesity), as well as hepatic steatosis, liver enzymes, TG, and inflammatory biomarkers (hs-CRP and CK-18) in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",95bba4d5-066d-4b86-8b58-9b8e345b4529
21,discussion15," However, the intervention did not change the levels of HDL-C, TC, LDL-C, glycemic markers, and total antioxidant capacity. In other words, the 5:2 diet can be a non-pharmacological tool in the management of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by improving not only specific markers of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) but also several cardiometabolic parameters.
