0,methods0," Animals  Fifty-four male Sprague Dawley rats at 7 weeks of age were received from Envigo Labs, Indianapolis, IN. They were housed individually under controlled laboratory conditions (12-hour light/dark cycle with lights on at 7:00 PM at a room temperature of 20.0–22.2°C) in solid-bottom cages with aspen chip bedding. All protocols described were approved by the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (040618-CG2).  Diet  Upon arrival, animals were randomly placed into one of the 2 diet groups. The first 6 weeks of the study consisted of inducing obesity by feeding one group of rats a high fat diet (HFD) (n = 28; formula D12492 from Research Diets Inc) while the rest received a SD (n = 26; Mazuri rat chow 5663; Table 1).  10.1371/journal.pone.0275684.t001 Table 1 Macronutrient composition (Niepoetter et al. 2021).  	high fat diet (HFD)	SD	 Fat (kcal)	60%	17%	 Carbohydrate (kcal)	20%	56%	 Protein (kcal)	20%	27%	 Energy Density (kcal/g)	5.",5c9e1219-d890-4b25-9081-b0f121639321

Metabolic testing  Capillary blood sampling was used to obtain overnight fasting glucose (mg/dL) and BHB (mmol/L) levels between 7:00 and 9:00 am on day 6 each week. Blood samples for this testing were obtained by pricking the rats’ tail veins using 26-gauge lancets. Results were obtained immediately using a Keto-Mojo (Napa Valley, CA) glucose and ketone meter (model TD-4279). Previous studies have used capillary sampling and ketone test strips to measure circulating levels of BHB [40, 41].  Intermittent fasting  Once diet-induced obesity (diet induced obesity (DIO)) was achieved and behavioral tests were completed, the animals that were fed high fat diet (HFD) were referred to as obese (OB), and those that received SD became non-obese controls (C).",2b50c8af-f1a4-45c5-959c-38861f7557ab
2,methods2," Both the high fat diet (HFD) and the SD groups were divided into four subgroups each (Fig 1; Table 2): obese high fat diet (HFD) ad libitum (OB-high fat diet (HFD)-AL), obese high fat diet (HFD)-IF (OB-high fat diet (HFD)-IF), obese SD-AL (OB-SD-AL), obese SD-IF (OB-SD-IF), non-obese high fat diet (HFD)-AL (C-high fat diet (HFD)-AL), non-obese high fat diet (HFD)-IF (C-high fat diet (HFD)-IF), non-obese SD-AL (C-SD-AL), and non-obese SD-IF (C-SD-IF). Animals in the IF groups were fasted for 18 hours per day, 7 days a week. Animals were on IF for 2 weeks before behavioral testing was initiated. After 2 weeks on IF, behavioral tests were repeated to evaluate physical and mental fatigue.  10.1371/journal.pone.0275684.g001 Fig 1 Illustrates the groups and their treatments.

4,methods4," The common definition of physical fatigue is the inability of muscles to maintain a needed level of power during and after physical activity, which is measured in a variety of ways in humans, but is commonly assessed by OF in rodents [16, 29]. During OF, movements such as the number of line crossings, distance/time moving, and motion freezing are recorded [29]. OF measures exploratory behavior and movement to indicate the physical health of rodents. The OF apparatus utilized a 100 cm x 100 cm opaque plexiglass arena with central and peripheral zones. The animal was placed into the arena to explore freely for 6 minutes. The movements were tracked using ANY-maze video tracking system (Stoelting, Wood Dale, Illinois). The total distance traveled was recorded to examine the locomotor activity of the animal. OF was performed for eight consecutive days in the dark under red light conditions during their night cycle.",11b93cad-63e1-40a1-9568-f1bbe1804fbf
5,methods5," Mental fatigue, the impairment of cognitive performance due to the reduced mental alertness or the feeling of absence of energy, is evaluated by novel object recognition (NOR) testing in rodents [42, 43]. novel object recognition (NOR) testing measuring recognition memory provides an indirect assessment of cognition [42]. After the completion of OF testing over 8 consecutive days, the animals underwent a novel object recognition (NOR) study. Five objects of different shapes, colors, and dimensions were utilized for this study. During the familiarization phase, one object was placed in the same opaque plexiglass arena as used in OF, and the rats were then allowed 5 minutes to investigate the object within the arena. The animal was then returned to a holding cage for an inter-exposure interval (inter exposure interval (IEI)) before being returned to the arena. The familiarization phase was immediately followed by the first inter exposure interval (IEI) called the 0-hour test.",3ade0668-4a70-4197-b460-9d4f5e39bc7d
6,methods6," The remaining inter exposure interval (IEI)s occurred at 24-hours (one day), 72 hours (3 days), and 168-hours (7 days) after the initial 0-hour test. The duration spent by the rats investigating the new object compared to the familiar object translates to the animal’s recognition and provides a numerical measurement for memory [34, 42].

7,analysis0," A priori power analysis and data quality assurance  G*Power (version 3.1.9.4) was used to calculate the sample size needed to obtain a power of at least 0.8 at an α = 0.05. Power calculations were based on a moderate correlation among repeated measurements (r = 0.5) and a moderate effect size (η2 = 0.15). If rats did not gain at least 10% on the high fat diet (HFD) relative to the mean of the SD control, these animals were excluded from the analysis. As such, the initial calculated sample size of 44 individuals was increased by a factor of 22.7% (10 individuals) to buffer against non-responders.  a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of individual variables  Measurements of body weight, blood glucose and ketones as well as the behavioral data analysis during diet induced obesity (DIO) is previously published [34].",3c6f5392-4a15-4a4d-83dc-ce205487a11e
8,analysis1," In this study, body weight, blood glucose, and blood ketones were measured once per week and the averages of each of these variables analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)) in PROC MIXED of SAS (version 9.4).

Diet type had a significant effect on glucose levels in both non-obese and obese rats, with high fat diet (HFD) exhibiting higher glucose levels than SD-fed rats. Glucose levels were significantly lower in the non-obese rats undergoing IF, when compared to AL rats (p<0.01; Fig 2).

13,discussion0," This study utilized a diet induced obesity (DIO) model to examine whether IF would result in mental and physical fatigue in obese and non-obese rats. It was found that IF, regardless of diet, led to decreased weight gain and lower blood glucose levels [13, 44, 45]. These findings are supported by Bhoumik et al. (2020), which used Wistar rats to evaluate the effects of a time-restricted feeding model of IF (18- hour fast, 6- hour fed) or alternate day fasting (24 hours fed, 24 hours fasted) compared to AL controls over a 4-week time period. At the end of the study, it was found that both time-restricted feeding and alternate-day fasting resulted in decreased body weight and lower fasting blood glucose levels compared to AL rats [44]. In a study by Spezani et al.",913cb13f-6253-46e5-b549-8c32ab768b11
14,discussion1," (2020), male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to IF (alternating between 24-hour access to food and 24-hour without access to food) for a period of 4 weeks while being fed either a standard (10% kcal fat), high-fat (50% kcal fat), or high-sucrose (50% kcal sucrose) diet. After 4 weeks on the IF regimen with these diets, all the mice exhibited weight loss and lower fasting glucose levels [13].  Weight loss and lower glucose levels are often associated with the metabolic switch that occurs during an IF regimen, which results in an increase in BHB levels due to lipid metabolism [10, 12]. In this study, obese rats fed SD on IF had higher ketone levels than their AL-SD counterparts. The group that exhibited the greatest difference in blood ketone levels were the C-AL-high fat diet (HFD) and C-IF-high fat diet (HFD) groups. In a study by Dedaul et al.",f3d0453b-669b-489c-939a-50d230810bd5
15,discussion2," (2019) using non-obese male C57BL/6 mice that were fed high fat diet (HFD) fasted for 8 hours a day for 4 days or fed AL, IF alone increased beta-oxidation but high fat diet (HFD) paired with IF further increased this process, thus resulting in higher ketone levels [46]. It was shown that mice fed high fat diet (HFD)-IF had greater metabolic flexibility as evidenced by the increase in phosphorylation of lipid metabolism regulators and greater ability to activate lipolysis in white adipose tissue [46].  While differences in ketone levels were not significantly different between all of the IF groups compared to AL groups (Fig 1), higher ketone levels, whether induced by diet or the IF regimen, were correlated with increased distance traveled during OF, indicating a resistance to physical fatigue. Ketones provide an alternative fuel for oxidative phosphorylation and makes oxidation a preferential process, which minimizes glycolysis [47].",32398639-d29a-4118-9c0d-96a91ba5a7de
16,discussion3," Increased ketone levels have been associated with improved physical performance and decreased fatigue in previous studies [23, 24]. A study by Nozawa et al. (2009) demonstrated the benefits of increased blood ketone levels in combating physical fatigue with mice exposed to bonito extract, an agent that increases ketone levels. Mice exposed to bonito extract were put through a forced swimming test and forced walking model to test for physical fatigue. Mice on bonito extract exhibited increased ketone levels as expected and resistance to physical fatigue [23]. This finding is further supported by a study by Murray et al. (2016) where rats fed a 30% ketone diet produced higher ketone levels and ran 32% further than control rats during a treadmill walking test [24].  Similar to OF testing results, the novel object recognition (NOR) testing results showed that IF had no negative impact on recognition memory which is an indirect measure of cognition.",71ca3d25-8b39-4243-8f7a-8dbf43345042
17,discussion4," While many studies have reported improved cognition with IF regimens, these studies utilized longer duration of IF [30, 48, 49]. A study by Elesawy et al. (2021) saw improvements in cognition via elevated plus maze testing after 12 weeks of IF (16-hour daily fast). It was reported that IF rats had an increase in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3, which they contributed as the factors improving cognition [49]. A study by Anson et al. (2003) utilized an alternate day fasting model in C57BL/6 male mice over a period of 20 weeks and measured IGF-1 signaling as evidence of neuroprotective qualities. It was found that IF rats had higher levels of IGF-1 signaling compared to AL groups, suggesting that IF may have a beneficial effect on cognition [48]. An improvement in cognition was also demonstrated in a study by Li et al. (2013).",e34def2f-77c7-4cd9-a6f9-997688561102
18,discussion5," After exposing 7-week-old mice to control, high fat diet (HFD), or alternate-day fasting with SD conditions over 11 months, the animals underwent a Barnes maze test to measure spatial working memory by recording the amount of time it took to enter the correct target box that was previously introduced during a habituation phase. The mice in the fasting condition outperformed mice in the other groups [30].  One limitation of this study was the shortened duration of exposure to IF. Though 2 weeks of exposure produced noticeable differences in body weight and glucose levels, it is possible that extending the duration of IF could enhance the results of behavioral tests as well as ketone levels. The IF regimen in our study did not cause a significant increase in the ketone levels in the OB-IF-high fat diet (HFD) versus OB-AL-high fat diet (HFD) group or the C-IF-SD versus C-AL-SD groups, potentially due to the shorter duration of IF.",a4bfdcee-fbe7-458b-9cdc-c65f20daeb7d
19,discussion6," Other studies have shown increases in ketone levels when exposing rodents to IF over a long-term duration [48, 50]. A study by Anson et al. (2003) utilized an alternate day fasting regimen in male C57BL/6 mice for a period of 20 weeks. By the end of the study, these mice exhibited decreased glucose levels and increased plasma ketone levels while the body weight was maintained throughout the study [48]. These findings were reiterated in a study by Park et al. (2020) in an 8-week study of rats fed either a ketogenic diet, 30% high fat diet (HFD), IF (24 hours fed, 24 hours fasted), high carbohydrate, or control diet. Rats on IF had higher plasma ketone levels and decreased body weight, but did not exhibit a difference in fasting glucose levels [50]. Additionally, measuring food consumption and calculating caloric intake could be used to further explain the observations from this study.",9a5583c9-8714-41c3-8f20-fcfabcfed09e
20,discussion7," Future studies should include food intake measurements and an extended timeline to overcome these limitations.  In conclusion, this study validates the use of IF for improved fasting glucose levels and decreased weight gain irrespective of the nature of the diet in both non-obese and obese groups. IF for 2 weeks does not contribute to mental or physical fatigue but longer duration may offer more benefits. Furthermore, increased ketone levels were correlated with increased physical activity, suggesting a protective role of ketones against physical fatigue.
