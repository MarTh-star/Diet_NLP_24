0,discussion0," In view of the commonly reported reduced physical activity during Ramadan, we strongly believe that WF would be the ideal choice of physical activity for populations with varying levels of physical fitness, hence, encouraging fasting Muslims to be active and remain physically active thereafter.  No studies have yet been conducted that have specifically examined the chronic effects of concurrent training on WF and RF. However, studies that have examined the impact of chronic exercise training in the fasted state (but non-Ramadan specific fasting) have shown positive outcomes.  Continuous endurance exercise training (3 days per week, progressively from 25 to 40 min at 60–75% HRmax) for 12 weeks showed a significantly greater reduction in body weight and favorable lipid profile when the endurance training was performed in conjunction with an alternate day fasting regimen relative to performing either alternate day fasting or exercise on their own among obese subjects (22).",91994308-b958-4ccc-aa66-a4fbcb404d92
1,discussion1," This study by Bhutani et al. (22) was among the first to show experimental evidence that the combination of alternate day fasting and exercise produces superior changes in clinical and health markers when compared to either modality alone.  Likewise, Edinburgh et al. (23) showed that in obese participants, 6 weeks of chronic exercise (3 sessions per week cycling at 50–55% peak power output) improved insulin sensitivity and increased skeletal muscle glucose transporter type 4 levels by two times more when performed in the fasted state (overnight fasting) relative to being performed in the fed state.  With regard to cardiovascular exercise performance, Stannard and colleagues showed a significantly greater magnitude of improvement of 9.7% in VO2max among healthy participants who underwent 4 weeks of endurance exercise (5 d·wk−1, 25–100 min incrementally at 65% VO2max) in the overnight fasted state group relative to the 2.5% improvement in VO2max in the fed group (24).",8f259c93-1fdc-4026-ba78-fb30f1fd7003
2,discussion2," Indeed, in their review, Knuiman and colleagues suggested that exercise training in the fasted state can lead to a much greater metabolic stimulus to the working muscles which could amplify training-induced adaptations relative to the same exercise training performed in a well-fed state (25).  While WF does elicit many cardiovascular and metabolic health benefits to participants, we reiterate that the main advantage of WF relative to other forms of exercise and physical activity programs is its inherent social attractiveness. WF is played in small groups of individuals requiring close teamwork to be successful. The integral socially friendly format of this exercise mode fits nicely and naturally appeals to the physically and metabolically challenged older age group. Indeed, it has been argued critically that WF is likely to be a sustainable form of exercise for older adults (18).  Ramadan Fasting and WF  To our knowledge, there have not been studies on WF during RF.",0b61a123-7ac9-401d-84e7-88e133a09f43
3,discussion3," Future studies looking into health outcomes of WF in RF and the non-fasted state as well as studies comparing WF with other low-intensity exercises during RF in an age-adjusted and gender-adjusted manner would be useful to promote exercise in a more physically active Ramadan to reap the maximal health benefits from RF.  Conclusion  Fasting and exercise can independently provide health benefits. Hence, we hypothesize that the combined effects of RF and WF training will likely show relatively greater cardiovascular and metabolic health benefits than either RF or WF alone. While more studies directly examining the effects of WF on health in the Ramadan fasted state is needed to provide evidence to support our proposed hypothesis, we propose to encourage fasting Muslims to engage in physical activity, specifically in WF, for cardiometabolic and psychological benefits, in keeping with the spirit of discipline and social interactions encouraged in the Ramadan month.",811318ec-21e2-4843-b6d4-867c8147cd8a
