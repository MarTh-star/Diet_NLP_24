0,background0,"Time restricted and Calorie restricted diets are orthogonal interventions that constraint when and what is eaten. Calorie restriction is among the most reproducible life-prolonging interventions across taxa [1]. Intermittent and periodic fasting are two modalities of diet restriction that improve many cardio-metabolic risk factors and may increase healthspan in humans [2]. Surprisingly, time restricted produces strikingly similar results to calorie-restricted diet [3], despite only restricting the period when meals are consumed and not calorie intake. The reasons behind this have just started to be elucidated, but may involve the circadian rhythm [4]. The circadian rhythm controls a variety of physiological processes, including metabolism, sleep-wake cycle, and feeding. Central to these rhythms is the circadian clock, a transcription-translation feedback loop that can sustain an approximately 24-h cycle.",aaf69366-436f-46de-b712-f362753be041
1,background1," The central clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei but other tissues also have clocks, e.g. heart, liver, kidney and adipose tissue [5]. The phase of the central clock is synchronized by light, but other factors such as mealtimes also entrain the phase of central and peripheral circadian clocks [6]. Both the absence and periodicity of mealtimes induced by intermittent fasting and time restricted diets may improve synchronization among central and peripheral clocks, which may lead to increased amplitude of clock gene expression [2]. Increased amplitude of the circadian rhythm oscillations is hypothesised to improve the overall health and cardio-metabolic status and disruption of circadian rhythm, e.g. shift work can lead to cardio metabolic conditions [2].",89d8e1bc-51a5-4609-a9a3-89dfbfb1bc57
2,background2," However, it is not clear how exactly this contributes to health status [7] or how to reconcile this with the pathogenesis of cardio metabolic disease, particularly the role of diet in connection with risk factors such as triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, and insulin. Downstream pathways in peripheral tissues are plausible mediators of the circadian rhythm effect on health status, but the genes and the biological processes involved remain elusive.  One strategy to identify the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of fasting on health is to identify fasting induced changes in gene expression across the body. Previous studies of the relationship of gene expression with fasting and calorie restriction investigated adipose, blood, skeletal muscle, liver, and mucosa gene expression by contrasting controls with fasting cases [8–10] or calorie restricted individuals [10–19], or by contrasting different times of the day [20].",6070a608-6b54-4400-8c8f-5bcbc7e4d959
3,background3," However, none of these studies looked simultaneously at the effects of hours fasting and time of day on gene expression. Hence, it is not yet clear whether the effect of fasting is conditionally independent of the effect of time of day on circadian rhythms. Likewise, it is not yet clear if fasting and time of day response is independent of cardio metabolic risk factors. Other technical and design issues are also noteworthy, previous studies did not adjusted for the effects of seasonality, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and age, had smaller sample sizes (ranging from 4 to 311), used microarray or panels of genes, all of which may confound or bias the exploration of genes across the dynamic range of expression levels. Most importantly, skin transcriptome-wide gene expression response to hours fasting and time of day is yet uncharacterized.",d2481363-feb7-4fbd-a5fa-58fee87d636e
4,background4,"  Here we conducted an RNA-Seq gene expression association study on hours fasting adjusting for time of day, seasonality, body mass index (BMI) and age in adipose tissue and skin from 625 female twins from the TwinsUK registry. Adipose tissue plays a systemic role in metabolism, in the reproductive axis and in immune system homeostasis [21]. Skin is the largest organ and has an important systemic role on metabolism and the immune system [22] partly due to vitamin D synthesis. Circulating levels of vitamin D are associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis [23].",c8743d5f-240f-4d29-bdd5-664304c8c61a
5,background5," Our aims are: 1) to map the pathways that independently respond to fasting and time of the day, to understand whether any of these pathways are common to both exposures, converging downstream into a common pathway; 2) to identify biological processes shared by both skin and adipose tissue as this may hint at details of the systemic organization of the response to fasting and time of day; 3) to identify novel genes responding to fasting independently of time of day and genes robustly replicating over the literature in multiple tissues in humans, non-humans and across taxa (i.e. both humans and non-humans) as this may hint at functional and/or conserved pathways; 4) to assess the characteristics of common genetic variants regulating the expression of fasting responsive genes, by looking at expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and gene by environment (GxE) eQTL analyses.

6,methods0,"Selection of individuals and embedded design Twin pairs from the Twins UK registry were invited to clinical visit by telephone call and allocated to available time slots in the weekdays. The allocations happened haphazardly but subject to both twin pairs availability. Twins are routinely followed up over the years and multiple observations for some variables are available. We embedded a cross-sectional study on the subset of individuals whose materials for RNA extraction, hours fasting and clinical markers were collected on the same day that the anthropometric measurements were taken, with the exception of DNA which was collected previously. The rationale for using cross-sectional design follows directly from the time-dependent nature of the gene expression response to fasting and time of the day. We collected data over a period of 6 h which is 50% of the elapsed time between maximum and minimum amplitude (average 12 h for a period of 24 h).",b1474544-3cbf-445c-9d93-9b073dc2ae58
7,methods1," For the genes with acrophase at 8h30m or 14h30m the study can detect up to 50% of the total peak-to-peak difference (the maximum signal). We further restricted our analysis to individuals that fasted less than 23 h to avoid recall bias. Out of the ~ 850 individuals in all tissues, 625 individuals that meet all above criteria remained. Twins visits to the clinic were made over a period of ~ 600 days. The analyses of the collected materials were also performed at different times and in different batches. We recorded these dates and batches for investigation of potential confounders.  Tissue collection The study sample included 856 female twins who are a part of the TwinsUK registry and are all of European ancestry. Punch biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue from a sunlight-protected area of the stomach adjacent and inferior to the umbilicus were obtained from consenting individuals.",2308d7f5-7e39-41c0-a153-e9f8c6520fcd
8,methods2," Skin from the punch biopsy was then dissected to separate it from adipose tissue, and both samples were weighed and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. All the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the St. Thomas Research Ethics Committee (reference 07/H0802/84) at St. Thomas Hospital in London. Volunteers gave informed consent and signed a consent form before the biopsy procedure. Volunteers were supplied with an appropriate detailed information sheet regarding the research project and biopsy procedure by post before attending the biopsy.  Genotyping and imputation Genome-wide SNP data for the TwinsUK individuals were generated as previously described. [32]In short, TwinsUK samples were genotyped on a combination of platforms (HumanHap300, HumanHap610Q, and 1 M-Duo Illumina arrays). Quality control and merging of the array datasets has previously been described in detail [32].",f0fd7086-0bf8-4d32-9f6c-61bce1a98bee
9,methods3," The cleaned data were pre-phased with IMPUTE2 with no reference panel and were then imputed into the 1000 Genomes phase 1 reference panel (interim, data freeze accessed November 10, 2010; the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2012). Variants with an INFO score > 0.8 on all platforms and a MAF > 5% were retained for analysis.  RNA-Seq, exon quantification and normalization RNA-seq data were generated, quantified and normalized as previously described [25]. In brief, samples were prepared for sequencing with the unstranded Illumina TruSeq sample preparation kit and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 machine. The 49 bp paired-end reads were aligned to the UCSC Genome Browser GRCh37 reference genome with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. GENCODE v.10 was used to annotate genes. Samples were excluded if they failed to have more than 10 million reads map to known exons or if the sequence data did not correspond to actual genotype data.",12cda5ee-2999-4cc5-b8b9-412bfe015f5e
10,methods4," To quantify exons, all overlapping exons of a gene were merged into one meta-exon. We counted reads as mapping to a given meta-exon if either of its start or end coordinates overlapped a meta-exon boundary. All read-count quantifications were corrected for variation in sequencing depth between samples by normalizing the number of reads to the median number of well-mapped reads. We only used exons that were quantified in more than 90% of the individuals. Exon expression values were rank-based inverse normal transformed for downstream analysis.  Covariates and clinical markers recorded We considered the following previously collected anthropometric and metabolic markers: total cholesterol, total triglycerides, HDl cholesterol, glucose, and insulin.",63d9ec6f-a0d5-4764-8bd4-6e63452ed7b2

The following RNA-Seq technical covariates were collected for each individual: GC content, median insert size, primer index.  Transcriptome-wide association analysis of expression levels Transcriptome-wide analysis were conducted using mixed effects models implemented in lmer package of R. The model used for all analysis unless otherwise stated is: yi=XB+Zu+∈i   Where yi is a vector of n individuals with the expression levels of exon i, X and Z are the design matrices of the fixed and random effects containing n individuals in the rows.",179f3a70-70f1-4646-a2c0-3d17576912ce

Hours fasting and time of clinical visit were modeled as continuous linear variables. The random effects were: Primer index; Date RNA-Seq experiment was conducted for this sample; Family identifier; Clonality identifier defined uniquely for each DNA sequence, such that a pair of MZ twins have the same id (because they have the same DNA) but each twin from a DZ pair have unique ids. These technical factors are an intrinsic part of the study design and should be included in the model.",8f96c07e-5bf1-4116-b6ea-6f628fe22ef8
13,methods7," In addition, gene expression in this sample and others has been shown to be associated with age [33], body mass index (BMI) [31] and season [34]. As dawn time is a major cue for the synchronization of the circadian rhythm, we adjust for seasonality to avoid confounding with hours fasting and time of the day.  Statistical significance of the gene expression association study As expression levels are highly dependent, we corrected for multiple testing by applying the Benjamini Hochberg algorithm to hours fasting and time of the day (sample biopsy) in skin and fat and selecting the most stringent cut-off from all analyses (P < 1 × 10− 5) that guarantees a Benjamini Hochberg FDR ≤ 0.05 in all tissues and all exposures assessed.  Replication of genes in the literature We conducted two systematic searches in pubmed for papers reporting gene expression analysis of the response to fasting and calorie restriction separately in human and nonhuman mammals.",0bedf97f-1c3c-4717-a583-5b4f39465ff8
14,methods8," As the automatic annotation of papers with MESH tags is not perfect, we enriched the search with the following strategies: i) retrieving all papers with “gene expression” keyword, selecting all relevant studies among the most recent top 100 papers; ii) using the same search string on google scholar, mendeley, and google. Once all relevant papers were identified, we extracted the significant genes reported in these studies, we converted probes, gene ids or gene symbols to ensembl ids using ensembl biomart. Studies reporting EST we used Genbank batch query followed by scripts developed in house to extract the RefSeq Id (e.g. NM_91388) and then converted these using the same process described above. Swissprot ids were converted to ensembl id using Swissprot tools. Non-human genes were mapped to ensembl ids using the strategies above and then mapped to human orthologues using ensembl biomart.",30eda414-4c5d-490c-84c1-d742f5a5889d
15,methods9," Once all genes for all species were converted to human orthologues, we calculated the gene overlap between each study, including our study. We analysed two metrics to assess study replicability: Proportion of overlap between gene lists of study A and B was defined as|A∩B|/min(|A|,|B|); The percentage of the study genes replicated was defined as the number of genes that overlaps with at least another study divided by the total number of genes of study Ai:|⋃j (Ai ∩ Aj)|/|Ai|for all j ≠ i.  Gene ontologies enrichment We conducted gene ontology term enrichment using definitions of biological processes GO terms downloaded from R package org. Hs.eg.db, corresponding to a total number of 5828 in fat and 5992 in skin GO terms. All analyses restricted to terms < 500 genes. GO term enrichment was independently conducted on genes significantly associated with Hours fasting and Time of the day using the TopGO package from R. We implemented all enrichment tests present in the package.",ce4364b1-fbe5-4198-bf45-2bb023e02f4a
16,methods10," GO terms that pass bonferroni correction (P < 10− 5) either on Fisher Elimination or Fisher methods were considered significant but results for all algorithms are presented (mostly consistent across all methods). We repeated the enrichment analysis using Ingenuity and ToppFun due to quality of the annotation database. Except for ToppFun, all analyses were conducted considering only the genes expressed in the tissue. The gene annotations with the GO circadian rhythm and ingenuity circadian clock pathway were further confirmed against the literature.  Sensitivity of GO term enrichment to P-value cut-off We tested sensitivity of results to the significance cut-off by applying a more stringent cutoff on P-value and repeating the enrichment analysis.

Identification of potential cardiometabolic risk factors mediating or confounding the expression response to fasting We regressed Glucose, TC, TG, HDL-C on hours fasting adjusting for age, age2, body mass index (BMI), time of day, and the following random effects: Family, Clonality, Biopsy Date using a mixed effects model. We identified the subset of variables that are potential mediators or confounders of the effects of hours of fasting in the circulating levels of these cardiometabolic markers by i) identifying those markers associated with hours fasting, ii) discarding all markers whose association with hours fasting was abrogated after adjusting for a significant cardiometabolic marker.",9cfb33e5-b0ae-4a64-83e3-81b8626bd3bb

26,results0,We analysed 625 female twins cross-sectionally embedded in the TwinsUK registry that satisfied the inclusion criteria (the exclusion was mostly driven by having all variables collected at the same time point). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the individuals in this study. All individuals analysed are females with a mean age of 58 years and standard deviation (S.D.) of 9 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 27 kg.m− 2 and S.D. 5 kg.m− 2. This is in agreement with the rest of the UK population [24] for the age bracket. The hours fasted ranged from 1 to 23 h and the time of day when visits to the clinical facilities for the collection of the biopsy ranged from 08.30–14.30 h. The visits occurred relatively uniformly between Monday to Friday in ~ 226 days out of 365 calendar days for nearly 20 months. A total of 250 women attended clinic between 8:30 and noon (AM) and 444 attended between noon and 14:30 (PM).,01401c58-1b4f-4f59-99d2-281e0505058b

33,results7," (Table 2). The significance of the overlap was inferred with a fisher test as above. We found 71 genes in adipose (Overlap significance P < 10− 16, OR = 37.1) and 19 in skin (Overlap significance P < 10− 16, OR = 67.4) that respond to both hours fasting and time of day. This corresponds to 72% of genes associated with time of day in adipose and 35% in skin (Table 2). The substantial overlap of genes that respond to hours fasting conditionally independent of time of day in adipose suggests that these exposures elicit similar downstream processes.  To assess and compare the magnitude of the response to hours of fasting and time of day, we compared the average magnitude of the effect size (expression standard deviations/hour) of the exons significantly associated with each exposure in adipose and skin (Table 3). We found that the magnitude of adipose and skin response to time of day was around twice that of hours fasting (|βHF| ≅ 0.05 and|βthe day (TOD)| ≅ 0.",b7207a8e-03eb-4881-9942-562f9da35665

Time of day effect is in the opposite direction of fasting for all exons significantly associated with both exposures (Additional file 1: Table S1). These results suggest that the effect of time of day in gene expression is strong in these tissues, and may counteract the effect of fasting around the time clinical examinations occurred.  Genes associated with hours fasting replicate among human tissues and across taxa To replicate our results, and identify genes that are associated with hours fasting consistently across human tissues and taxa, we conducted a literature search for gene expression papers of diet restriction (including fasting modalities) and queried the GenDR database for genetic manipulations in model organisms that cancel out or disrupt the life-extending effects of diet restriction (Additional file 1: Table S2).",3eab107c-9f53-4220-bb66-e34a25934abc

We assessed the replicability of each study by looking at the percentage of their genes replicated in other studies and likewise, we assessed the replicability of each gene by looking at the percentage of studies that reported the same gene (see methods). Among studies sampled from the literature, the median percentage of genes replicable in at least another study was 28.5% in humans and 57% in nonhumans. In both cases, studies on fasting and calorie restrictions show similar pattern of gene overlapping (Additional file 1: Table S2). In our study (Additional file 1: Table S3), 194 genes in adipose and 45 in skin replicated at least in one other study (Corresponding to 53% in adipose and 57% of genes in skin).",6f8b0934-c5cb-470e-ac57-e70f530b1413

Genes associated with hours fasting are enriched for circadian rhythm We conducted a gene ontology enrichment analysis of the significant genes associated with hours fasting in adipose and skin using TopGO (Additional file 1: Table S4), ToppFun (Additional file 1: Table S5), and Ingenuity (Fig. 4, Additional file 1: Table S6).

The subset of genes associated with hours fasting in both skin and adipose (Fig. 3) yielded a stronger enrichment for circadian rhythm than each tissue separately (BH FDR < 0.05), suggesting a systemic response.

Circadian clock pathway response to fasting not mediated or confounded by cardio metabolic risk factors, AM/PM visit and gene sequence parameters To assess whether the enrichment for circadian genes in fasting and time of day were mediated or confounded by cardio metabolic risk factors, AM/PM interaction, residual confounding, gene sequence characteristics, and quantification method, we re-ran several models adjusting for several potential confounders (Additional file 1: Table S9) and repeated the enrichment analysis using TopGO in adipose and skin (Additional file 1: Table S10).",d2c474e5-2874-4743-8ea8-78a1f72d62b1

We stratified the data into AM and PM samples and the enrichment was still present in PM (AM sample was smaller). As restricting the sample to individuals that attended PM visits controls the effect of the time of the day, residual confounding with this covariate can be excluded as a potential explanation for the association of hours fasting with gene expression levels.

We concluded from this analysis that circadian rhythms in gene expression are influenced by hours fasting independently of cardio metabolic risk factors and not confounded with the technical factors and parameters that we can sensibly implicate in the expression response of these tissues.  Relationship between fasting and genetic regulation of gene expression To investigate whether change in expression of the genes responding to fasting and time of day may have a role in disease and other phenotypes, we investigated whether cis-eQTLs of the exposure-responsive genes are coincident with complex trait GWAS signals. As GWAS-coincident cis-eQTLs place modulation of expression of these genes on the molecular pathway between the genetic variant and trait, it is plausible that fasting or time of day-induced changes in expression could also impact the linked trait.",7d5b92dd-61b1-4810-ba1f-e7fb89b821b3

Five genes responsive to hours of fasting (CTPS1, DNM3, HEMK1, SLA3R2, TRIM27, TSEN15) are regulated by cis-eQTLs coincident with height GWAS signals (Table 4). Fasting responsive genes were also regulated by variants associated to Crohn’s disease (PTGER4), Rheumatoid arthritis (PHLDB1), Lung Function (ADAM19) and with cardiac troponin (TNNT2).

47,discussion0,"We conducted an association study between gene expression and hours fasting, adjusting for time of day, seasonality, body mass index (BMI), age and other technical covariates in a large sample of human adipose and skin biopsies. We identified 417 genes associated with hours of fasting in adipose and skin, which partly overlap with 137 genes associated to time of day in these samples. More than 50% of genes responding to fasting in our study were corroborated by a literature analysis of other gene expression studies on fasting and calorie restriction in other species and other human tissues. The response to hours fasting was more extensive in number of genes and stronger in magnitude in adipose tissue than skin, which is not unexpected given the central role of adipose tissue in metabolism.",1efaae0e-78a6-4723-9131-5c775dbf3625
48,discussion1," Interestingly, in genes associated to both exposures, the effect of time of day was stronger and in an opposite direction to the effect of hours of fasting, and thus may counteract the effect of fasting in some genes during the observed time window. This effect is consistent with clinical trials of the physiological response to meal times [27] suggesting improved cardio metabolic risk factors and weight management for those consuming most calories in the first half of the day. This finding may have consequences for deciding the optimal period of the day for fasting and planning of biomedical interventions.  Fasting responsive genes were enriched for circadian rhythm and circadian clock genes among other biological processes. The enrichment for circadian rhythm did not subside after sensitivity analysis, re-running the associations conditioning on cardio-metabolic risk factors, or when restricting to samples collected in the afternoon.",8f956f01-301a-4cd3-86b4-a8991412ea3a
49,discussion2," Genes with transcriptional responses to both exposures in both tissues were even more highly enriched for circadian rhythms and circadian clock suggesting this is systemic component of the fasting response in adipose and skin of humans. A role of gene expression circadian rhythm in time-restricted diets has been hypothesized based on animal models and in vitro studies of human materials [2, 3] but the case for hours fasting is not yet fully established, particularly it was not clear whether the association is not confounded with time of the day, seasonality, and risk factors involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of cardio metabolic disease. Our results contribute to this discussion by providing data from an observational study in multiple human tissues with approximately 625 individuals, the largest so far. Our results consolidate the theory that response to fasting and time of day share common pathways [4], particularly the circadian clock.",edc285d2-17c7-45a7-89e9-e91655c6a322
50,discussion3," The similarity of the beneficial effects on health of both time restricted diet and fasting might be underpinned by this common pathway, independently of known risk factors of the pathogenesis of cardio metabolic disease, such as cholesterol and triglycerides.  Regulation of genes response to time of day and hours fasting was tissue specific, with greater proportion of genes responding in fat, and interestingly the percentage overlap of genes responding to both exposures also larger in fat. We also found a larger proportion of regulatory variants interacting with hours fasting in fat; showing that expression plasticity in response to fasting is tissue specific. This support the notion that gene expression regulation is tissue-specific [28] and that tissue-specific regulatory variants may influence the onset of conditions affecting a particular tissue type.",23e886a2-17d6-4f0f-82df-57f9f7f70fb7
51,discussion4," An idea supported by the fact that several exposure-responsive genes had regulatory variants overlapping GWAS signals of complex diseases.  Some limitations are important to mention, this is an observational twin-study of females with average age of 58 years and the hours fasting was self-reported which may be subject to error, recall bias, social desirability bias and self-selection bias. We removed individuals that fasted more than 23 h to avoid recall bias. Self-selection bias in hours of fasting, e.g. for medical reasons, is small as this is a relatively healthy sample. As the time of the visit was allocated more or less haphazardly, this exposure will be less affected by confounding. The study may have missed circadian rhythm genes with acrophase centred outside the collection interval or that respond less vigorously to time of day in these tissues.",fbabe41b-b5a4-4566-b891-d6f3f2fbf05e
52,discussion5," The circadian rhythm genes (particularly those in the canonical circadian clock) were the most significantly associated genes with time of the day (and with fasting duration), which indicate the response of at least these circadian rhythm genes was vigorous and centred in the sampling interval. In order to identify further circadian rhythm responsive genes, the biopsy collection needs to be extended over a broader time interval, including the night hours. In this case, additional genes whose expression oscillate in a sinusoidal pattern with a period of 24 h could be potentially captured using a cosinor transformation of time of the day. In our study, the collection time range is truncated to 6 h. Hence, mostly genes with moderate and large expression changes between morning and afternoon will be detectable.",d002b4a1-5032-4683-980f-4e5676e5860d
53,discussion6," In this scenario, expending an additional degree of freedom in a cosinor model is less attractive due to the incurred loss of power to fit a more complex model and the risk of over-fitting a cross sectional sample. The fact that we detect most clock genes and large numbers of circadian rhythm genes suggests the linear model was a good compromise. As this is an observational study, individuals that fasted long hours tend to fast overnight. Consequently, there is a chance of a putative interaction or confounding between duration and modality of fasting, i.e. between fasting overnight and fasting long hours. Nevertheless, the effects can still be ascribed to fasting regardless of the underlying characteristic mediating the effect. While our sample size (N = ~ 625) is well powered to detect associations between gene expression and our exposures, it is relatively small for detection of genetic interaction effects, which limits the power of the GxE scan.",7ee6fbf6-6fae-47c7-bb7c-253939bcd17a
54,discussion7," GxE interactions are difficult to detect in humans, but recently have been detected on regulation of gene expression in several studies [29–31] where the reduced search space, large effect size and in some cases use of cell lines allows greater power to identify interactions. As such, we report the results of the GxE scan, but note these results will need to be tested in other datasets to determine their robustness. Some strengths of the study are also worth mention. As we carefully selected only external exposures and avoided endogenous or intermediate phenotypes, the study is more robust to collider bias and confounding.  Conclusions This study identified 417 genes whose expression is associated to hours fasting independently of time of day and seasonality, two important confounders of circadian rhythms. One hundred and seventy-eight of these genes have not previously been implicated in the response to fasting, and another 171 have not been linked to fasting in humans before.",10120a0f-e6e3-44fc-a7e1-1509f134eab5

This study contributes to the characterization of the transcriptional response to fasting in humans. Gene expression studies like this provide unique opportunities to unveil the molecular mechanisms of the response to exposures and therefore contributes to the identification of targets for therapy or drug development, and the conditions under which such targets vary.
