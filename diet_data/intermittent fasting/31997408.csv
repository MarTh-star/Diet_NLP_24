0,introduction0,"There are several forms of intermittent fasting (IF), all using fasting periods that extend well-beyond the duration of an overnight fast and implicating limited feeding time-windows, with or without caloric restriction (1, 2). For example, in time-restricted feeding/eating (time restricted feeding/eating (TRF)), eating is limited to a certain number of hours each day (3). Alternate-day fasting (Alternate day fasting (ADF)) consists of alternating between feasting and fasting days—feasting is compatible with ad libitum energy intake during 24 h and fasting implicates a caloric intake ≤ 25% of daily needs (~ 500/600 kcal during 24 h) (4, 5). Recently, a focus on intermittent energy restriction (intermittent energy restriction (IER)) has emerged in the scientific literature as an alternative approach to continuous energy restriction (continuous energy restriction (CER)) for improving body composition (6).",80f9a38c-66a3-45e7-bea5-b13bf4b7f46f
1,introduction1," It includes periods of energy restriction alternated with periods of habitual intake or minimally restricted dietary intake, allowing wider food choices (6, 7). Various forms of intermittent energy restriction (IER) are currently being used for clinical purposes, including the “5:2 diet” and the “week-on-week-off” (7–9).  The ultimate goal of most IF regimens is to improve body composition. For this reason, they are suggested to maximize the loss of fat mass (FM), while attempting to preserve fat-free mass (fat free mass (FFM)) (3). There is compelling evidence that IF elicits reductions in body weight and FM of ~3–8% (4, 10–14) and ~4–15%, respectively (1, 4, 10–13). Improvements in blood lipid profile, blood pressure and insulin sensitivity have also been consistently reported (5, 14).",e093db4e-891e-4beb-9e81-1896252a3663
2,introduction2," While the majority of studies explored the effectiveness of IF on improving body composition in adults with overweight/obesity (4, 5, 11, 13–15), there are only occasional reports that included normoponderal individuals (10, 13). Despite not being a universal finding (2, 16), IF has also been shown to induce slight increases in fat free mass (FFM) [e.g., (17)]. In this specific study, the authors used a crossover design to compare time restricted feeding/eating (TRF) with an alternative diet involving three meals per day for a period of 8 weeks, with energy intake being individualized to each participant to ensure maintenance of body weight throughout both treatments (time restricted feeding/eating (TRF) and non-time restricted feeding/eating (TRF)). Under these conditions, time restricted feeding/eating (TRF) was shown to be effective in decreasing FM and increasing fat free mass (FFM) (by ~1.5 kg; p = 0.06) (17).",a8097aca-a5ca-4b0f-bd92-a75ed85dde82
3,introduction3," In what concerns intermittent energy restriction (IER), and contrary to the initial belief, it seems to be unrelated to compensatory hyperphagia on ad libitum days; thus, similarly to that seen during continuous energy restriction (CER), intermittent energy restriction (IER) is accompanied by a negative caloric balance and this results in comparable changes in body composition between both interventions after 12 months of treatment (7). However, instead of being externally driven, caloric restriction during intermittent energy restriction (IER) is purely spontaneous (18).  Apart from being used for clinical purposes, IF is also used in many religious practices. A notable example is Ramadan IF, which is the most widely-studied form of IF (19). During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from ingesting food and liquids between sunrise and sunset throughout a month-long period (20, 21). Thus, food and liquid intake becomes exclusively nocturnal.",d6df62c7-18a9-4742-bcb4-346766f04ed1
4,introduction4," Even though Muslims eat ad libitum after sunset and before dawn, caloric restriction often accompanies Ramadan IF (22). Ramadan IF can last ~12–18 h/day, depending on the geographic location and season of the year (23–25). Reductions in body weight, relative FM and resting metabolic rate are common consequences of Ramadan IF (20, 26). It has also been shown that Ramadan-related caloric restriction decreases total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) and fasting blood glucose levels. In parallel, Ramadan IF seems to improve body composition, possibly through enhancements in the ability to mobilize saturated fatty acids for metabolic processes (25). Changes in body composition may also reflect a balance between the unavoidable decrease of meal frequency (i.e., from 3–4 to 2) and sleep duration, together with a reduction of spontaneous daily physical activity and coercive dehydration (27–29).",5f0fff0e-a3d7-458f-b4ca-d1a5b73a0d91
5,introduction5," However, the effects of Ramadan IF on body composition are not conclusive, with some studies indicating significant reductions in body weight (19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30–34) and many other failing to show any relevant changes (21, 22, 27, 35–40). Such inconsistencies might be secondary to the specificities inherent to the participants included in each study. Alternatively, they may be dependent on differences between studies at the level of macro and micronutrient intake, or even arise as a consequence of cultural rituals or the number of fasting hours (23).  Taking all these points into consideration, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at summarizing the existing evidence on the effect of various IF regimens (i.e., time restricted feeding/eating (TRF), Alternate day fasting (ADF), intermittent energy restriction (IER), and Ramadan IF) on body composition.",8584c865-859d-4b40-8169-9c67d0d38981
6,introduction6," In addition, we sought to determine whether Ramadan and non-Ramadan IF exert a differential impact on human body composition. We hypothesized that various types of IF might contribute for improving body composition and that this effect might be further enhanced in circumstances compatible with a non-Ramadan dietary approach. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing such a comprehensive perspective. ",fc425d43-a48b-42e8-a2c8-763ab7a2a9c6

Eligibility Criteria Articles focusing on the interaction between IF and body composition outcomes were retrieved. Only original research published in peer-reviewed scientific journals were considered. Studies were selected for this review if they respected the following criteria: (i) included samples of adults (≥18 years), regardless of sex, (ii) had an experimental or observational design, (iii) investigated any type of IF (i.e., time restricted feeding/eating (TRF), Alternate day fasting (ADF), intermittent energy restriction (IER), or Ramadan IF), and (iv) included body composition outcomes (i.e.",759ecac8-aad0-4714-8286-2a0152154a1c

Review articles, case studies, protocols, as well as abstracts/conference papers were also excluded.  Search Strategy A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed articles was conducted in May 2020 in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science.",9e5964b8-d6b4-4644-ae6f-dfbfda4b50fa
9,methods2," Searches included combinations of two sets of terms: (i) terms concerning the dietary intervention (i.e., IF) and (ii) terms representing the outcome of interest (i.e., body composition).

10,methods3,"  Screening and Data Extraction All titles and abstracts identified from the literature searches were screened for potential inclusion eligibility by three authors (JC, IS and GVM), based on the eligibility criteria mentioned above. Duplicate entries were removed. Relevant studies were fully screened by the same authors.

11,methods4,"  Quality Assessment Study quality was assessed with the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project (Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP)) (42), evaluating five key methodological domains: selection bias, study design, confounders, data collection method and withdrawals/dropouts. Since it is not possible to blind participants regarding a fasting condition, the sixth item of the original scale (blinding) was not assessed. Each domain was classified as strong, moderate or weak methodological quality. A global rating was determined based on the scores of each component. The five domains and overall quality were rated independently by two authors (JC and IS), and discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached. Inter-rater agreement across categories varied from moderate (Cohen's k = 0.6) to strong (k = 1).",eabeb1ce-5f27-43c6-83cf-b4f4179c582c
12,methods5,"  Data Synthesis For each study, results were summarized by: (i) intervention characteristics (intervention protocols, methods and duration), (ii) changes in body weight, (iii) changes in body mass index (BMI), (iv) changes in absolute and relative FM, and (v) changes in fat free mass (FFM).  Data Analysis Analyses were conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Comprehensive Meta Analysis (CMA)) software version 3.0 (43). Separate meta-analyses were performed for each outcome (body mass index (BMI), FM, fat free mass (FFM), and body weight) considering all studies, only Ramadan IF and only non-Ramadan IF studies. Meta-analyses were conducted using both random-effects and fixed-effect models, in which the summary effect size (ES) is the standardized mean difference (standardized mean difference (SMD)) of a distribution (44, 45).",f393f3c8-665f-4e80-8727-37c2cf393fbf
13,methods6," Random-effects models were chosen for most analyses due to the high number of available studies (k ≥ 6), assuming that the true effect size varies from study to study and that the studies in our analysis represent a random sample of effect sizes. When the number of studies per outcome was limited (k < 6), we used fixed-effect models, assuming that the true effect size is the same in all studies and the only reason for the effect size to vary between studies is sampling error (44). standardized mean difference (SMD)s were calculated based on sample size, standard differences in means (between pre- and post-intervention time points and between pre- and post-intervention data of both treatment and control groups) and effect direction, and were interpreted according to Cohen's guidelines, with values of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 for small, medium and large standardized mean difference (SMD), respectively (46).",5e8ced36-8f33-4799-a686-7eba725b6bf5
14,methods7," The 95% confidence interval (CI) and corresponding p-values were considered as indicators of statistical significance. To evaluate the amount of variation in the effects of included studies, we tested for heterogeneity using the following approach: (i) the Cochran's Q statistic (47), for which a significant p-value (< 0.05) demonstrates that studies do not share a common standardized mean difference (SMD) (i.e., there is heterogeneity in the effect sizes between studies); and (ii) the I2 statistic (48) that assesses the proportion of observed dispersion that is due to real differences in the actual standardized mean difference (SMD) and is not affected by low statistical power. The I2 ranges from 0 to 100%, where a value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity and values of 25, 50, and 75% reflect low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively (48).",44d71547-28f4-4062-8cc7-1e119d2fee7f
15,methods8," Some studies did not provide sufficient data to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and therefore the number of studies per outcome reported in the qualitative synthesis may differ from the ones included in the meta-analyses.  Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine whether the effect of IF on body composition outcomes varied according to the pre-intervention nutritional status (overweight/obesity vs. normal body weight), exercise (protocols with vs. without exercise), and caloric intake (controlling for vs. not controlling for caloric intake). These subgroup analyses were conducted using mixed-effect models (i.e., random-effects model was conducted within subgroups and a fixed-effect model was used across subgroups) (49). Between-groups Q statistic and corresponding p-values were used to compare the mean effect across subgroups.",53105d55-e50f-49b5-8269-badfac73540e
16,methods9," Some studies included samples with both individuals showing normal body weight and excess weight/obesity, and therefore could not be included in moderation analyses.  Sensitivity Analyses Sensitivity analyses were carried out to explore if the results were affected by methodological quality. Therefore, primary analyses were repeated excluding studies with poor methodological quality. Publication bias was also examined by visual inspection of funnel plots for asymmetry. To quantitatively confirm the visual impression, Egger's test (50) and Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill method (51) were used, but only for meta-analyses with 10 or more studies per outcome and no substantial heterogeneity, since the power is too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry.

Quality Assessment Supplementary Table 2 shows the detailed classification of each quality domain and the overall methodological quality of each study. Of the 66 studies identified as relevant for this systematic review, the overall methodological quality of 40 studies was rated as “moderate” and 26 were classified as “weak.” Twenty-seven studies (randomized controlled trials) were rated as strong and 13 (non-randomized controlled trials) were rated as moderate regarding the quality of study design; the remaining studies were rated as weak.",03dfdfbe-7ed0-40dc-9ef8-f5a79b42119e
20,results3," All studies (k = 66) were classified as weak regarding selection bias (representativeness) because the samples were self-selected or composed by volunteers. With regard to the adjustment of analyses for confounders, all studies (k = 66) were classified as strong because there was no bias arising from lack of controlled elements. In what concerns data collection methods, all studies were rated as strong because they all used valid and reliable tools. Finally, regarding the reporting of withdrawals and dropouts, 20 studies were rated as strong, 19 studies were rated as moderate, and one study was rated as weak.

41,discussion0,"This study sought to summarize the effects of different IF approaches on body composition-related outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis presenting comprehensive results on changes in specific parameters of body composition resulting from Ramadan vs. non-Ramadan IF, which is of considerable relevance given the recent popularity of these approaches among researchers and clinical nutritionists/sports physiologists.  Our findings showed that, when comparing pre- with post-intervention data between treatment and control groups, Ramadan IF elicits significant reductions in some body composition parameters, namely in relative FM and body weight. Similar results were also found when considering pre- to post-intervention (within-subjects design); specifically, data indicated that Ramadan IF leads to significant reductions in body mass index (BMI), FM (relative and absolute), and body weight.",eb5b42dd-47f1-4c7f-b5e3-8f48c8ec1554
42,discussion1," Our findings also suggest that, with Ramadan IF, weight loss seems to be more pronounced in persons exhibiting higher body mass index (BMI) values, although there were no significant differences between groups (normal weight vs. overweight/obesity). These findings are in line with those of past research (30). A greater loss of body fluids in individuals with overweight/obesity during Ramadan IF offers a likely explanation for such relationships (52).  In the general population, weight loss subsequent to Ramadan IF is largely caused by the unconscious restriction of food intake. Under these circumstances, the reduction in meal frequency is causally linked with the prolonged daily periods of standing and praying (19, 24, 26, 31, 32, 36). In addition, there is a metabolic shift toward the predominant use of fatty acids as fuel for adenosine triphosphate (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) synthesis during Ramadan IF and this lowers body fat (25).",9977a7f1-672a-4321-85ff-a46b21019839
43,discussion2," The optimization of energy reserves during this type of IF may also serve as a possible explanation for this phenomenon. According to this concept, while being effective in preserving protein pools via a reduction in basal metabolism, Ramadan IF also leads to a decreased secretion of anabolic hormones (e.g., insulin) and an increased secretion of catabolic hormones (i.e., adrenaline and glucagon) (53). Interestingly, it has been contended that weight loss resulting from Ramadan IF is also accompanied by reductions in fat free mass (FFM) (>35% in normoponderal people and ~20–30% in those with overweight/obesity) (54). Our meta-analytic findings do not support this contention, revealing no significant effects of Ramadan IF on fat free mass (FFM). From a physiological standpoint, this is a relevant finding because fat free mass (FFM) is well-known to play an important role on functional capacity, resting energy expenditure and blood glucose homeostasis (55).",2294d553-094b-4378-8e7c-0428e13f198d
44,discussion3," However, despite representing an important opportunity for some people to lose body weight and FM, the adaptations inherent to Ramadan IF are typically transient and largely reversible within a small amount of time (26). Thus, the prescription of maintenance strategies at termination of Ramadan is of extreme value for the long-term preservation of healthy body composition.  Caloric restriction and different forms of fasting are well-known to exert a powerful physiological impact on humans, namely on health status and body composition (5). According to our analyses, more than half of the studies (pre- post-intervention within-subjects design) examining the effects of non-Ramadan IF on fat free mass (FFM) revealed small, but significant improvements in fat free mass (FFM). time restricted feeding/eating (TRF) was shown to be particularly effective in inducing slight increases in fat free mass (FFM) [e.g., (17, 56)].",08ec1670-a830-4361-a64d-86352063251a
45,discussion4," In fact, it has been argued that, when combined with resistance training, time restricted feeding/eating (TRF) has an adjunctive role in preserving or delaying possible fat free mass (FFM) losses (3, 57). Moreover, fasting triggers numerous endocrine responses that may well contribute for heightened metabolic rate and preserved fat free mass (FFM) (e.g., increased serum levels of noradrenaline and growth hormone, respectively) (58). In addition, exercising while fasting increases the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as well as the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)), both of which have numerous effects on gene expression (i.e., regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis) (59).",0a2be7a8-2f9e-4034-8a2c-cb0eba1ab6dc
46,discussion5," Yet, it has been disputed whether the interaction between time restricted feeding/eating (TRF) and gains in fat free mass (FFM) might be mediated by the amount of dietary protein intake, together with the final energy balance achieved on a daily basis (3, 60). This is partially supported by our moderation analyses because, when calorie consumption was taken into consideration, a significant effect of IF on fat free mass (FFM) emerged. In addition, when comparing pre- post-intervention data between treatment and control groups, the beneficial effects of IF on decreasing body mass index (BMI) were more pronounced after accounting for exercise training. Non-Ramadan IF also led to significant reductions in body weight and absolute FM when comparing pre- post-intervention data between treatment and control groups, as well as when comparing pre- post-intervention on within-subjects designs.",7a40eb76-1df4-47d7-a36d-9b8113d2c265
47,discussion6," In fact, studies specifically designed to test the effects of IF on body composition have consistently shown that different approaches of IF (i.e., Alternate day fasting (ADF), intermittent energy restriction (IER), and time restricted feeding/eating (TRF)) are well-suited for managing successful losses in body weight and FM (2, 10, 13, 61). One possible explanation is that 12 h of fasting generate a lipolytic-prone state that is compatible with decreased fat storage and enhanced fatty acid mobilization, together with ketogenesis (62). Moreover, in the short term, non-Ramadan IF (i.e., Alternate day fasting (ADF) protocol 5:2) appears to be superior (due to higher compliance) than continuous energy restriction (CER) for reducing FM (61).  According to the present beliefs, Ramadan IF is more effective for weight loss than non-Ramadan IF due to a greater loss of body water resulting from fluid deprivation (53).",5f04ac2b-bc5d-4466-9f0d-09820ec66732
48,discussion7," Although the opposite was found when considering our meta-analytical results involving pre- post-intervention analyses (within-subjects designs) (i.e., higher effects derived from non-Ramadan IF), similar results were observed for Ramadan vs. non-Ramadan IF interventions when comparing treatments and controls. However, there are clear differences in what concerns to absolute FM, with non-Ramadan IF showing greater improvements in this specific parameter, therefore being unequivocally linked to improved body composition.  This study has some limitations. First, our findings should be interpreted with caution because analyses were carried out on different populations. Second, since we did not include individuals from all ages, ethnicities, religions, geographical areas and educational backgrounds, our findings cannot be extrapolated to the general population.",948cb1ea-c935-4ab6-8f33-940fbab8458b
49,discussion8," Third, the degree of calorie restriction varied between studies and the non-fasting control groups also ranged from “normal diet” to continuous energy restriction (CER). Fourth, the nutritional profile of foods consumed during the ad libitum feeding period should be further monitored. Fifth, the analyses of body composition were made with different techniques and, due to the limited number of studies per technique, it was not possible to conduct moderation analyses. Bioimpedance, a technique that assumes individual euhydration, was used in many studies. Since Ramadan IF is typically accompanied by dehydration, in this specific context, the assessments of body composition using this method may be affected. The preferable use of gold standard techniques, such as the four-component model or even the single use of dual x-ray absorptiometry (only 16 studies here included used this method) in future research is fundamental.",a8f329b6-2ab3-4a37-bff1-1c18edc43a05
50,discussion9," This approach would greatly reduce the possibility of measurement inaccuracies. Finally, it would have been important to discriminate the moderating effects of different types of exercise (e.g., endurance vs. resistance training). However, the low number of studies on each specific type of exercise precluded us from conducting separate moderation analyses. Instead, all exercise studies were compiled and used as a single moderator.  In summary, our meta-analytic findings revealed a negative significant pooled estimate effect of both Ramadan and non-Ramadan IF on FM and body weight. However, we found that decreases in FM are more pronounced with non-Ramadan IF and this type of IF, combined with exercise training, leads to higher decreases in body mass index (BMI). Our data also provide preliminary evidence that non-Ramadan IF may be well-suited for eliciting small increases in fat free mass (FFM), particularly under circumstances involving the simultaneous control of caloric intake.",3938b741-16ff-414a-80c0-07e112677c6d
51,discussion10," Thus, although Ramadan IF certainly implicates some beneficial adaptations in weight management, non-Ramadan IF appears to be more effective in improving overall body composition (particularly, if combined with exercise training and controlled calorie intake), despite the fact it does not imply dehydration.
