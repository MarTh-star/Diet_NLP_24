0,methods0," Protocol and Eligibility Criteria  The systematic review protocol was registered within the “Open Science Framework” (OSF, DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/DE7BH). This systematic review followed the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses” (PRISMA) guidelines (20). The inclusion criteria were formulated based on the following patient intervention comparison outcome (PICO)S tool questions (21): P (population) = healthy Muslim adults willing to fast DR; I (intervention/exposure) = exposure to Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF); C (Comparison): DR and outside Ramadan [i.e., before-Ramadan (BR) and after-Ramadan (AR)]; O (Outcome): salivary flow rate (SFR) and saliva metabolic parameters; and S (Study design): all original articles written in English. No restrictions were applied in terms of study design, setting, country, or period. Publications not in compliance with the purpose of this systematic review as well as those not representing original research (i.e.",1c8162b2-44d8-4730-9c8d-563af3607fa0
1,methods1,", reviews, editorials, qualitative papers, case reports, case series, and letters to editors) were not included.  Literature Search  An online literature search was performed using two databases: PubMed and Scopus from their inception up to 15 July 2021. For PubMed, the search was carried out using a strategy employing the combination of the following two “Medical Subject Headings” (MeSH) terms: Saliva AND Fasting. As for Scopus, the previous two terms were searched for in the article titles, abstracts, and/or keywords. In addition, the reference lists of the included articles were checked. All the authors involved in this review agreed on the articles to be included in this systematic review.  Study Selection  The process of articles selection is outlined in Figure 1. Duplicate articles were eliminated using End-Note X9 library.",f0d12234-9b92-49af-a756-0bca525b620f
2,methods2," Titles of the remaining articles were independently appraised during the initial online literature search for studies by two of the authors (AB and MK in the authors’ list) to check for their relevance to the searched topics. Abstracts of these titles were then read to determine if the studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies whose abstracts met the inclusion criteria were then read in full-text format to determine their eligibility and therefore retention. Two authors (AB and MK in the authors’ list) conducted the study selection process for this review, with discrepancies being checked by a third author (HBS in the authors’ list), if necessary.

3,methods3," Data were extracted, reviewed, and analyzed by two authors (AB and MK in the authors’ list). Extracted data were then verified by a third author (HBS in the authors’ list). Discrepancies in data collection were resolved through discussion.  Methodological Quality Assessment  Methodological quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)) critical appraisal tool, precisely the checklist for cohort studies (https://joannabriggs.org/last visit: 4 March 2022). The checklist appraises the following areas: recruitment, exposure measurement, reliability of exposure measurement, confounding factors identified, strategies to deal with confounding factors, participants free of outcome at the onset of the study, validity and reliability of outcome measurement, follow-up timeframe reported, follow-up completion, strategies utilized to deal with incomplete follow-up, and appropriate statistical analysis.",9ebac823-978b-4578-b7e6-0250e48ca490

5,methods5," Two reviewers (AB and MK in the authors’ list) independently scored the retained studies, with discrepancies being resolved through discussion. If discrepancies could not be resolved through discussion, a third author (HBS in the authors’ list) intervened to reach consensus. The risk of bias in the studies was judged to be low (“yes” scores > 70%), moderate (50 ≤ “yes” scores between ≤ 69%), and high (“yes” scores < 49%) (22). ",5efbe09a-e2fc-4486-8173-92ba76466308
6,results0," Search Results  The search process yielded 675 articles, of which 202 were duplicated. Among the 473 remaining papers, 465 were excluded based on the title and the abstract. When screening the references lists of the remaining eight articles (23–30), one additional paper was added (31). After assessing full-text articles for eligibility, three articles were excluded (23–25). Consequently, six articles were retained (26–31). The search results are presented in Figure 1.  Methodological Quality Assessment Results  The retained six studies were assessed for methodological quality (Table 1). All the studies have a high score of bias (i.e., final score ranging from 9.1 to 36.4%). Items 2, 5, and 10 were rated as not applicable for all the studies. No study reported data regarding items 4, 7, and 11. Six (26–31), five (26–29, 31), four (27–29, 31), one (29), and one (31) studies included information regarding items 6, 8, 3, 9, and 1, respectively.",92db0918-b44b-41fb-8cce-6aa319926f69

Study Selection and Characteristics  Table 2 exposes the main characteristics and methodological points of the retained studies. The latter were published between 2004 (26) and 2020 (29, 30). The studies were conducted in Saudi Arabia (26), Turkey (27), United Arab Emirates (29), and Iran (28, 30, 31). The study design was not reported in three studies (27–29).",15d34d0d-3c81-44be-aa4d-cbb5c6ef75e8
9,results3," In the remaining studies, three designs were applied: observational design with repeated measures (26), case-control (31), and descriptive analytical research design (30). All the studies (26–31) opted for convenience samples. The Ramadan year was omitted in three studies (28, 30, 31). Only one study (29) mentioned the number of fasting days DR. Only one study (28) reported the average ambient temperature, which was around 15°C. Only three studies reported the mean fasting duration [i.e., 12 h (26), 15 h (29), 17 h (27)]. No study reported data with regard to the Ramadan season, the average ambient pressure, or the average ambient humidity.

23,discussion0," The present systematic review included six studies, all having a high score of bias (26–31). In these studies, eight saliva parameters were evaluated (salivary flow rate (SFR), melatonin, cortisol, glucose, IgA, uric-acid, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and aminotransferase (AST)). The main results were: (i) the salivary flow rate (SFR) decreased by 10% DR in fasting participants compared to controls (31), (ii) the circadian pattern of melatonin was unchanged DR, but melatonin level dropped significantly from baseline (28), (iii) the salivary cortisol levels were unchanged DR compared to BR (29), or increased DR (30), (iv) the salivary glucose levels were decreased DR (31), (v) compared to BR, on the 15th day of Ramadan, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) significantly increased, and uric-acid and aminotransferase (AST) significantly decreased (28); (vi) the salivary IgA decreased during the last week of Ramadan compared to BR (27).",6ee4f040-3a4c-4ae8-9e39-9eecbf11e2f1
24,discussion1," All the retained studies were heterogeneous and had several methodological differences. This heterogeneity limited the ability of the present review to perform any data synthesis via meta-analysis. It also challenged the researchers’ ability to identify trends in the data. Research reports in this area are few and they were almost limited to the changes of glucose concentrations in plasma (31). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review investigating the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on salivary flow rate (SFR) and saliva parameters.  Impacts of Ramadan Intermittent Fasting on Salivary Flow-Rate  salivary flow rate (SFR) decreased by 10% DR (31). DR, the lack of gustatory stimulation decreases the stimulation of salivary glands, therefore, salivary flow rate (SFR) may decline. The autonomic nervous system controls salivary flow rate (SFR) and the secretion of various salivary compounds (32).",68a016be-4903-4f4e-8918-461cbc19bb47
25,discussion2," Stimulation of this system induces modifications in salivary secretions and salivary flow rate (SFR) (33). In Ramadan, sedentary activity with minimal orofacial movement and metabolism slowing down in body tissues cells, including oral cavity cells, may explain the low stimulation of the autonomic nervous system (28). This hyposalivation can cause malodor, especially DR (34). Since saliva works to moisten the mouth, to neutralize acids produced by plaque, and to clean bacteria and food particles from the mouth, any salivary modifications create a suitable environment for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that coat several sites in the oral cavity, notably the dorsum of the tongue (35). Overall, it has been shown that oral microflora modifications taking place DR may lead to malodor, even if other factors are involved (36).",45438917-be23-477a-b52b-618af08e2e5d
26,discussion3,"  Impact of Ramadan Intermittent Fasting on Salivary Hormones: Melatonin and Cortisol  Melatonin in saliva or plasma is an indicator of the timing of the circadian clock (37). According to Bahammam (26), the sleep hormone follows the same circadian rhythm both BR and DR. This means that melatonin secretion is low during the daytime, while the highest levels are released at night, but its level drops significantly from baseline (26). This variation may be due to the sleep habits modification DR (36). Nevertheless, this outcome should be considered with caution because of the small sample size in the study (n = 8) (26).  Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands (38). Cortisol plays an essential role in balancing blood glucose and releasing sugar from the body’s stores in response to increased energy demands (39). Cortisol has an important role in the metabolism of fats and proteins as well as in the circadian rhythm regulation (38).",e8a3ca90-6b5b-4804-a9bb-0716d7b3e163
27,discussion4," This hormone is usually measured in the morning (7–9 a.m.) because it reaches a peak at this time (40). DR, external sources of glucose are reduced due to fasting. Consequently, salivary glucose concentration drops significantly (31). Thus, we can “speculate” that cortisol levels in saliva may rise to regulate glucose levels, however; the latter mechanism is not that straightforward and has to be elucidated by further research.  Dehagi et al. (30) reported that when participants are exposed to Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) and noise, which is another stress source, salivary cortisol levels increase. In addition to its glycemic effects, cortisol is also liberated during the stress periods in order to allow the body to adapt to an emotional or physical shock by mobilizing additional energy sources. The contradictory results of the studies of Al-Rawi et al. (29) and Dehagi et al.",face749e-2853-4025-8207-342b7dcd8625
28,discussion5," (30) may be due to methodological reasons, notably the study design and population, and the lack of information about the timing and duration of sleep in one study (30). It should be highlighted that many people in various Islamic countries may change their sleep rhythm during the Holy month. Indeed, their nighttime sleep duration is reduced compared to non-fasting days (41), in addition to the dietary patterns’ changes (42).  Impact of Ramadan Intermittent Fasting on Salivary Metabolic and Immunologic Data  Alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferase are usually measured together to investigate the hepatic, cardiovascular, and renal functions (43). alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a protein produced by various cell types (e.g., polymorphonuclear leukocytes, osteoblasts, macrophages, and fibroblasts) within the alveolar bone and/or the salivary glands (44, 45).",ff25942d-2fa8-4a35-a9ac-8ca494f250d7
29,discussion6," alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be a salivary biomarker of periodontal diseases and caries (46), as it interferes in the balance of the remineralization-demineralization cycle since it is primarily involved in calcium and phosphate binding (47). It seems that the function of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) relatively depends on the salivary pH and buffering capacity (48). Khalighefar et al. (28) reported that alkaline phosphatase (ALP) rebounds during the middle of Ramadan compared to BR. Although alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increase may suggest much more susceptibility to dental caries and/or oral diseases, it is believed that this fluctuation is not so critical to lead to an illness. aminotransferase (AST) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of several tissues and organs (49). Khaleghifar et al. (28) indicated that aminotransferase (AST) activity in fasting volunteers decreases significantly DR.",3eec5582-3c20-4aa5-9b7d-115536273de0
30,discussion7," This decrease can be related to the fact that fasting reduces the metabolism of body tissues cells, including oral cavity cells, thus leading to reduced salivary flow rate (SFR) during fasting (28). Uric-acid is the ultimate product of the metabolic breakdown of purines, which are the nitrogenous bases in DNA and RNA (50). It is involved in healing and defense (50). Khaleghifar et al. (28) reported that uric-acid decreases DR since the metabolism is reduced (28). In contrast, several studies have shown that blood uric-acid increases during Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (51–54).",8b7fb41b-36da-4e29-8edc-e8818e88e09c
31,discussion8," According to studies reported in the literature, despite the shifts in metabolic interactions among the organs producing uric-acid, aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP), we cannot conclude on the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on these enzymes because of the scarcity of these studies in addition to the limitations of the unique retained study investigating those parameters (28).  Salivary glucose DR plunges from baseline, especially in the first 10 days (31). First, this is expected because of food restriction for 4 weeks. Secondly, this fact is interesting and beneficial for oral health. Actually, both cariogenic bacteria and Candida use glucose for their development and survival (55, 56). This dysbiosis enhances the proliferation of these bacteria and dental biofilm development (46, 57). A recent study investigated the effect of different salivary glucose concentrations on dual-species biofilms of Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans (58).",b39027cb-e206-4b8b-816b-2270823a4b2c
32,discussion9," The authors reported that higher salivary glucose increases counts of Candida albicans (58). It is possible that the higher levels of IgA detected in saliva BR can be attributed to the greater colonization of the oral cavity by Candida albicans due to the higher salivary glucose levels during that period compared to DR.  Salivary IgA has an important role in mucosal immunity. Its levels increase in case of oral mucosa infection, such as candidiasis. It allows inhibiting the adherence of candida to epithelial cells (59, 60). In contrast, the decrease in those salivary IgA levels does not necessarily suggest that the participant is more susceptible to oral infection onset, since a salivary IgA concentration threshold is absent (27). Subsequently, authors suggested that Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) results in neither severe immunological disturbances nor adverse impact on health (27). Some remarks related to the usefulness of salivary IgA in real practice should be highlighted.",dcd977ba-7e0c-4523-a279-1b393bb14cd0
33,discussion10," First, there are some concerns regarding the usefulness of salivary IgA as a biomarker in the detection of respiratory tract infection due to lack of reproducibility, low specificity, and sensitivity (61). Secondly, there are conflicting data in the literature regarding salivary IgA levels induced by exercise, with some studies reporting a decrease whilst others have reported an increase or no change (62). Thirdly, previous studies have reported a decrease in systemic IgA levels without leading to an increase in infection (63). Fourthly, exposure to pathogenic microbes may be reduced DR, possibly due to consumption of more fresh foods DR compared to other months (64). It is possible that oral health and microbial exposure from foods are poorer BR, which may explain the higher IgA levels detected in the saliva DR (65). In this context, a recent study involving mice reported that oral colonization by Candida albicans increases IgA production (65).",b3df92c9-c866-4def-9571-684e043e214d
34,discussion11," Another study suggested that an increase in salivary IgA is an attempt by the immune system to counter the accumulation of microorganisms (64). Considering the aforementioned studies (63–65), the decrease in IgA levels DR may reflect a lower microbial colonization of the oral cavity DR. This is plausible since the number of hours when the mouth is exposed to foods and beverages is reduced DR compared to other periods when one considers the number of hours spent fasting and sleeping.  Overall, it seems that fluctuations in salivary parameters in Ramadan are not as significant as blood changes. These alterations are not enough to cause diseases in healthy participants. Nevertheless, we believe that further studies using other salivary biomarkers are needed in order to investigate correlations with the risk of oral disturbances or infections, such as caries, malodor, periodontal disease, or candidiasis in Ramadan.",812a91fe-336e-481e-94c6-aaf9b1098ca9
35,discussion12,"  In view of the absence of evidence about the impacts of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on oral health, we recommend the following four advices for people observing Ramadan: (i) adopt a well-balanced diet with sufficient hydration before Sahur and after Iftar; (ii) brush teeth, at least after Iftar and just after Sahur, before the dawn; (iii) rinse mouth without swallowing water for a better biofilm control and reduction of halitosis; and (iv) take care of the oral cavity, particularly for patients with chronic systemic diseases, especially with metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus) in order to avoid the progression of a preexistent pathology (e.g., periodontal disease, dental caries). Finally, it is recommended that dentists carry out “dental procedures” with special precautions [e.g., administer intramuscular or trans-dermal treatment instead of oral agents] (36).",d5333aa5-adff-4589-90eb-0821ff4a1a32
36,discussion13,"  Discussion of Methodology  According to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool, precisely the checklist for cohort studies, the methodological quality is considered as “low.” In fact, no study succeeded to get the average score and items related to “confounding factors” and “sample size calculation.” Moreover, “salivary collection methods” were not reported in any of the six retained studies (Table 1). First, non-inclusion of a non-fasting control group can be considered as a “bias” since the variations in the assessed parameters cannot be exclusively attributed to Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF). However, it is important to note that including non-fasting participants is still problematic, due to religious considerations in Muslim countries. For that reason, the non-fasting control groups could be the participants themselves outside the Ramadan period (e.g., BR and/or AR).",5de2f8d3-54fc-49d9-b9ec-9c6c8dd952f8
37,discussion14," Given the circumstances of the Ramadan observance, and for practical reasons, the authors think that is more feasible and easier to control the parameters than to arrange a separate group of participants who do not observe Ramadan. Secondly, selecting participants by a convenience sample may be considered as a major confounding factor (66). Convenience sampling is a type of non-probability sampling methods based on the judgment of the investigator (66). Its low cost and comfort of use make it an easy choice for investigators. Nevertheless, it can lead to under/over representation of specific groups inside the sample (66). Thus, it may be impossible to make generalizations in the whole population. For these reasons, convenience sampling should be treated with caution. Thirdly, calculation of an optimal size is a crucial point since it helps avoid an inadequate power to detect statistical effects (67). Using few participants in a study may lead to lower “precision” in findings.",46364500-4d57-422f-a353-09ac43ed9648
38,discussion15," A large sample size is, however, expensive and exposes more participants to procedures (67). Fourthly, the procedure of saliva collection was not well-described (Table 1). In fact, it is very important to standardize saliva sampling in order to make comparison between studies possible. Since saliva collection should be made at least one time DR, unstimulated saliva might be preferred. In fact, stimulated saliva must be collected by chewing sterile paraffin (68). Then, a minimum duration for sufficient saliva collection may be defined to ensure efficient analysis.  Additional limitations should be highlighted. For example, information about the season, the average ambient pressure, and/or the average ambient humidity was lacking in the included studies (Table 1). The average ambient temperature as well as the fasting duration were mentioned in some studies (26–29) (Table 1).",ff9e7a4c-c19f-4958-9195-8b727daf468c
39,discussion16," Consequently, both climatic conditions and geographical locations strongly influence Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) (69). Also, the inclusion of patients with obesity (i.e., body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) may be considered as a limitation. In fact, a lower salivary flow rate (SFR) was observed among obese compared to non-obese participants (70, 71). In addition, the inclusion of females and old participants could complicate the interpretation of saliva parameters (72, 73). Indeed, Mahesh et al. (72) reported significant changes in the pH and the buffer-capacity in post-menopausal females’ saliva compared to regularly menstruating ones. Besides, it is known that females do not fast all the month of Ramadan. Subsequently, the comparison with males may not be valid because they are not exposed to the same fasting period. With regard to age, changes in salivary pH, buffering-capacity, calcium, and proteins concentrations were reported (73).",57ebfdea-b594-427e-981d-0af4d6733aff
40,discussion17," Finally, the number of evaluation sessions was heterogeneous. Therefore, saliva collection should be performed at least three times as follows: BR (e.g., 1 week BR), DR (e.g., during the last 7–10 days of Ramadan), and AR (e.g., 7–10 days AR). In future studies aiming to evaluate the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on oral health, three important points should be reported. The first is related to the practice of fasting as a routine (e.g., some Muslims fast on Mondays and Thursdays during all the year). The inclusion of some participants who practice this ritual may influence some saliva parameters. The second point concerns the chewing stick, called “Miswak,” which is widely used in some Arab states of the Persian Gulf (74, 75). In fact, it seems that “Miswak” use increases salivary flow rate (SFR) (76). The third point concerns the hydration status.",3571570a-a40a-4759-9297-c3a575679dca
41,discussion18," The role of the hydration status BR and DR were not considered in the six retained studies and the differences observed in the concentrations of the different metabolites may be partly due to the hydration status, which can alter the salivary composition and salivary flow rate (SFR) (77). The six studies involved in this review did not adjust the concentrations of the different salivary biomarkers before comparing the data obtained BR and DR. Therefore, in the future, it would be interesting to see if the differences observed are still present after adjusting the metabolites by factors, such as total protein content, saliva osmolality, salivary flow rate (SFR), and saliva secretion rate (78).  The critical limitation of this Systematic Review is our inability to make a strong clinical case for the impacts of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on saliva parameters.",6fc2a69b-3b63-487d-abde-7c5b55f21eaa
42,discussion19," Table 4 summarizes some recommendations for designing future studies aiming to investigate the impacts of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on saliva parameters. It is recommended that researchers assess the antimicrobial, anticancer, and wound healing properties of fasting saliva (collected just before iftar) and compare it with non-fasting saliva. Moreover, it would be great to compare the fasting saliva proteome with the non-fasting saliva, and to see if the fasting saliva can be a source of novel peptides that display health benefits (79). This will address the “myth/superstition” in medieval Europe where fasting saliva was used as a medicine (80, 81).

45,discussion22," ⋅Report and interpret the effect size measurement (if needed). Clearly distinguish the “clinical” significance approach from the “statistical” significance approach.	  Conclusion  There is a general trend toward a decrease in salivary flow rate (SFR) and a decrease in the content of the majority of the biomarkers investigated, with the exception of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and uric-acid. These changes cannot be easily attributed to any single factor, especially because of the lack of information on the hydration status, dietary habits, physical activity, and hygiene habits. Although the findings of this systematic review are interesting, scientific evidence should be interpreted carefully because studies of the impact of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on saliva parameters are scarce. This is mostly due to the lack of accurate methodological details or variations in the investigated saliva parameters and the employed methodologies.",81e634cd-e880-4e20-8dba-533bb26c5807
