0,methods0," 2.1. Study Design  A case report was used to analyse the influence of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on performance and body composition in a professional soccer player. In this design, an initial measurement prior to the intervention (start) and a measurement after the intervention (final) was conducted.  The participant was informed about the possible risks and discomforts that could arise and was asked to complete a health history questionnaire and sign a consent form. The research strictly followed the Declaration of Helsinki (Edinburgh review in 2000), and the procedures were also in accordance with the recommendations of the EEC Good Clinical Practice (document 111/3976/88 of July 1990). The subject signed an informed consent to participate in the study after receiving all the information. All procedures were previously approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Alicante (UA-2021-03-11).  2.2.",b0215bd8-82c1-4ccd-91a6-8ade9701bab7
1,methods1," Participant  The participant was a 20-year old African soccer player since he was 5 years old, having now 15 years of experience. He has been playing soccer at a professional level, for the team in La Liga for the last two seasons. He usually trains 12 h per week and his only dedication is soccer. He is healthy, does not take any medication, has never undergone surgery and has an optimal blood biochemistry.  2.3. Data Collection  2.3.1. Body Composition  Body weight was measured early in the morning, fasting and with minimal clothing, using a Tanita BC-545n, (Tanita Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) to the nearest 0.1 kg. Standing height without shoes was measured using a Seca 213 stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 cm.",23132e12-2073-4c34-a90a-cf3f9da1417b
2,methods2," To minimize the potential source of Bioimpedance systems (Bioimpedance systems (BIA)) related to total body weight and height, body composition assessment was performed by a level three anthropometrist following the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK)) recommendations [18]. All measurements were performed at the same location, at room temperature and under baseline conditions. The technical error of measurement for perimeters, circumferences, lengths and heights was less than 1% and less than 5% for skinfolds.  Anthropometric measurements were performed following the complete profile of International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) II methodology [18]. Skinfolds, girths, lengths and breadths were measured with a caliper, flexible metallic tape, segmometer and pachymeter, respectively (Holtain, Crymych, UK).",86237ee6-c0f2-4e34-a234-3ff4a8ecec05
3,methods3,"  Bone and muscle mass were obtained through Rocha’s equation [19] and Lee’s formula [20], respectively. Fat mass was estimated using Carter’s formula [21], Faulkner formula [22] and Withers’ equation [23]. Residual mass was calculated from the difference between the total body weight minus the sum of the bone, muscle and fat masses. According to the Spanish Committee of Kinanthropometry, these methods are the most suitable for high performance players [24].  Somatotype components were calculated from the assessment of different body compartments, including fat mass for endomorphy, muscle mass for mesomorphy, and leanness and relative bone linearity for ectomorphy. The differences between each individual somatopoint with respect to the mean value was calculated using the somatotype attitudinal mean (somatotype attitudinal mean (SAM)) [25,26].  Proportionality analyses were performed using the Phantom stratum [19]. Each variable was fitted to the Phantom size using the z-score.",ae6c3b42-0ce3-4991-ad3a-4e49e60b8d2a
4,methods4," The z-values have a mean of 0, so a z-value of 0.0 indicates that the given variable is proportionally equal to the Phantom; a z-value greater than 0.0 means that the subject is proportionally greater than the Phantom for that variable; and, conversely, a z-value less than 0.0 shows that the subject is proportionally less than the Phantom for the variable [19].  2.3.2. Performance Measures  As indicators of global strength, the countermarch jump (countermovement jump (CMJ)) and the Abalakov jump test [27] were performed. In the countermovement jump (CMJ) test, the participant performed a maximal vertical jump starting from a standing position, without allowing the arms to swing, and bending the knees 90°. The participant performed several familiarisation trials prior to the test [28]. A contact platform (Optojump Next Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) was used to measure the countermovement jump (CMJ). Three measurements were performed with 30 s recovery in between.",72588272-3b08-40d0-93f8-c34788b41427
5,methods5," The flight time was used to calculate the jump height. The best jump was used for subsequent analysis [29,30].  The Abalakov jump test followed the same protocol. The participant also performed 3 countermovement jumps with 30 s rest between jumps, on a platform with an optical (infrared) data collection system (Optojump Next Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) to calculate the Abalakov jump height [31]. The player had to stand up and perform a 90° knee flexion followed by the fastest extension to reach the highest possible jump height. Of the three results, the best one was used for statistical analysis.  2.4. Nutritional Intervention Protocol  2.4.1. Nutrient Intake  For the dietary-nutritional intervention, quantitative estimates were made of total energy expenditure based on basal metabolism, using the Harris–Benedict formula [32] and corrected body weight. Physical activity expenditure was estimated from standardized factors [33].",0c18af5f-684c-428c-9962-4b7251c4b59c
6,methods6," The proposed diet was based on an isocaloric intake following the recommendations for elite soccer players [34].  Table 1 shows the values of macronutrients and vitamin B12 provided by the dietary-nutritional guideline established according to the recommendations for elite soccer players. Fiber intake was around 25 g per day and total cholesterol was less than 200 mg per day. The software used in the elaboration of the diet was Dietopro (Dietopro, Valencia, Spain) [35].  Because the time of ingestion is different than usual during the Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), a schedule was established with SK for each of the different meals (Table 2).  2.4.2. Supplementation  Glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol) is produced from glucose, protein, pyruvate, triacylglycerols and other glycerolipid metabolic pathways and is a binding metabolite in numerous pathways [27].",b5b9cdb2-3247-434c-ad60-2e3915fc614e
7,methods7,"  During Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), glycerol is the only source of gluconeogenesis, as glycogen stores are depleted within two days of fasting [28]. Considering its role as an energy substrate, glycerol could effectively improve sports performance [28]. The combined ingestion of glycerol and fluid has been used to increase body water volume, thus maintaining hydration by reducing the rate of water elimination from the kidneys [27]. The intake protocol is shown in Table 3.  3. Results  3.1. Body Composition  The soccer player remained weight-stable throughout the study period (the initial weight was 86.1 kg, while at the end of the intervention the weight reached 85.9 kg). The athlete claimed to have followed the entire nutritional plan, based on 3400 kcal, 4.6 g/kg/day of carbohydrates and 2.5 g/kg/day of protein.  Table 4 shows the results of the body composition assessment between the beginning and the end of the Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF).",73a4dcc3-b2cf-4536-8493-85292f2f6a41
8,methods8," It can be observed that both weight and fat mass percentage decreased after the intervention. However, muscle mass increased (from 50.26 to 51.50%). The somatotype presented is ecto-mesomorphic, where mesomorphy predominates and ectomorphy is higher than endomorphy.  With regard to skinfolds, the triceps (4.5 to 3.5 mm), subscapular (8.2 to 7.6 mm), biceps (3.4 to 2.5 mm), supraspinal (4.5 to 4.2 mm), abdominal (5.8 to 4.8 mm), thigh (6.3 to 6.1 mm) and leg (4.3 to 2.8 mm) skinfolds decreased, while the triceps (4.3 to 2.8 mm) skinfold decreased, (5 to 4.2 mm), abdominal (5.8 to 4.8 mm), thigh (6.3 to 6.1 mm) and leg (4.3 to 2.8 mm) decreased, while the iliac crest crease increased (6.1 to 6.4 mm).  Differences were observed in the different variables for anthropometric dimensions and proportionality profile. The results for Z-perimeter calf (0.06 to 0.20), Z-perimeter thigh (−0.08 to −0.25), Z-perimeter hip (−0.95 to −1.72), Z-perimeter waist (−1.17 to −1.20), Z-perimeter forearm (1.",0bc268bc-7b27-4b04-a1ee-01251c7c4261
9,methods9,"96 to 2.28), Z-perimeter flexed arm (2.49 to 3.15) and Z-perimeter relaxed arm (1.98 to 2.06) were higher after the intervention. However, the Z-perimeter mesosternale decreased from −0.28 to −0.20.  3.2. Sport Performance  Regarding sport performance results, lower limb power measured with the countermovement jump (CMJ) and Abalakov jumps tests shows a considerable improvement in performance after the Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) and the dietary-nutritional intervention performed. The variation of the Abalakov jump was from 39.16 to 49.34 cm, while the countermovement jump improved from 36.72 to 40 cm.  4. Discussion  The main objective of this research was to evaluate body composition, physical condition (through different physical tests) and a personalized dietary-nutritional plan in a professional soccer player at the beginning and at the end of the Ramadan period.",8ef51cfa-153b-4d43-8a7b-89de4caf17d4
10,methods10,"  Differences in daily energy intake among different studies could be due to dietary habits, cultural customs, biopsychosocial environment, and geographical differences of the study participants. The present findings demonstrate that the estimated total daily energy intake was not affected by Ramadan fasting, since the player followed the dietary pattern, where the nutritional plan was adapted to the fasting schedule [29,30,31].  In terms of body composition, the player presented lower initial characteristics of muscle mass and higher fat mass compared to the end of the study. This can also be seen in the measurement of skinfolds, where all decreased, except for the iliac crest. So far, no study has analyzed these parameters in such depth. Only one study by Durnin and Womersley et al. [36] analyzed the sum of 4 skinfolds (triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac); it was observed that there was no significant difference after the Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) period [37].",9735eb66-687c-4207-8609-dd56f6f14d87
11,methods11," Another investigation by Meckel et al. [9] found a slight increase in skinfolds. These studies did not include the implementation of a personalized dietary plan, so the results may be due to an inadequate diet.  It should be noted that this is the first study to investigate the effect of a dietary-nutritional planning adapted to Ramadan on lower limb physical performance variables and 5-component body composition. This study consists of the countermovement jump (CMJ) and Abalakov jump tests, being the first study to evaluate Abalakov in a Muslim professional athlete. In reference to the scores, all were higher after the intervention. Therefore, the player had better lower body power at the end of the study than at the beginning.",37c63e98-478a-45b5-96aa-670aace3e763
12,methods12," These results at first indicate an increase in physical performance tests, however, they are different from those obtained in previous studies, as some studies showed that Ramadan fasting decreases physical performance [9,37], while others revealed no effect [3,4,6].  Furthermore, since Abalakov tests can be used as a performance indicator and as part of the selection process of youth soccer players for national teams [38], future research should include this test in its variables.  On the other hand, some researchers [27] underline the importance of the qualities of glycerol for success in aerobic and anaerobic activities, emphasizing the effect on performance, since it can be used as an energy substrate. The findings of such supplementation evidence its relevance and usefulness in the athlete population, since it has been observed that hypohydration decreases maximal aerobic power [27].",401fcdb1-89ca-4fdc-9647-85ff87460675
13,methods13," Therefore, the effects of such supplementation could have had a positive impact on the performance tests of the subject included in the present study, following the same line as other investigations [39].  Existing scientific evidence shows that adequate hydration and nutrition are essential to improve performance in soccer during Ramadan periods [1,40]. It should be borne in mind that soccer is a high-intensity intermittent sport played in hot environments, so there is an increased risk of dehydration, with sweating rates in elite players of 1–2.5 L/h [39]. Therefore, both physiological function and cognitive and athletic performance are compromised. To maximise the effects of training during Ramadan and better adapt to the conditions presented, it is essential to make appropriate dietary choices, ensuring optimal energy intake during periods of high-intensity, long-duration training [1].",5b6f7745-ea3d-4acf-8149-ed8b667f7306
14,methods14,"  The results of this case study should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on the performance of a single athlete using an experimental protocol (n = 1) in which neither the participant nor the researchers were unaware of the project during the intervention phase. In fact, only one set of performance tests was conducted at the beginning and end of the intervention. Future research will consider the previously mentioned limitation. It is recommended that researchers in the field provide more detailed information on fitness assessment, body composition and dietary habits in future studies on professional soccer players and the Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), as research is still scarce.  5.",35c4f882-2e8b-4a53-9255-73cf88c1dce5
15,methods15," Conclusions  During a fasting period such as Ramadan, an optimal and personalized nutritional planning according to the demands and needs of each athlete, accompanied by a supplementation of glycerol and rest protocol, allows for improvements on body composition and lower limb performance indicators in soccer players.
