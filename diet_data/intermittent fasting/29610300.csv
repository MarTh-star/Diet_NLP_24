0,background0,"Overweight and obesity prevalence has increased over recent decades in many parts of the world [1] and obesity has been associated with several comorbidities and increased mortality [2]. Many dietary regimens are used to decrease body weight and preserve a healthy body mass. Daily caloric restriction is probably the most common form of dietary restriction [3]. More recently, intermittent fasting has become an approach to energy restriction in humans [4]. Although observational data on the relationship between long-term intermittent fasting and risk of cardiometabolic disease are limited, there is evidence that both alternate-day fasting and periodic fasting may be effective for weight loss [3, 5]. Beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors have been reported including reductions in body fat, and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels [3–5].  Intermittent fasting has been evaluated in experimental animals under different scenarios.",ec890fa5-1c87-4e1e-bb7d-ab9ea5bc77df
1,background1," Usually mice and rats are deprived of food every other day and fed ad libitum on the intervening days [6]. Even in the absence of expressive body weight loss, intermittent fasting has been associated with lifespan extension, improved glucose regulation [7, 8], neuroprotection for memory loss [9–11], nephroprotection [6], and increased cellular resistance to various type of stress [12].  Information regarding the role of intermittent fasting on pathologic cardiac remodeling is scarce. Rats subjected to intermittent fasting both before and after myocardial infarction have demonstrated attenuation in both cardiac remodeling and left ventricular dysfunction [13, 14]. However, whether the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting initiated before and after myocardial infarction are similar is still unclear. In this study, we compared the effects of intermittent fasting before and after myocardial infarction on rat cardiac remodeling and survival. ",e24bf5d7-ee3a-40c1-befe-74e27c86e547

Animals were housed in a room under controlled temperature and light/dark cycle. Experimental design was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Botucatu Medical School, UNESP, SP, Brazil.  The rats were randomly distributed to be fed either every day (ad libitum, AL) or every other day (intermittent fasting, IF) with a standard rat diet. After 12 weeks of these feeding regimens, all rats were subjected to coronary artery ligation and the following three groups were created: fed ad libitum (AL); fed ad libitum before MI and intermittently fasted after MI (AL/IF); and intermittently fasted before and after MI (IF).

15,discussion0,"The novel design of this study is the comparison of intermittent fasting initiated before and after myocardial infarction on rat cardiac remodeling.  Caloric restriction has long been shown to increase lifespan in rodents [34]. Moderate caloric restriction was associated with cardiac ageing delay, improved pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling, and better myocardial ischemic tolerance [35–39]. On the other hand, severe caloric restriction impaired structural and functional parameters in spontaneously hypertensive rats [40]. Only more recently were cardiovascular parameters analyzed in rodents under intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting in normal rats produced controversial results. Castello et al. [41] observed protection against age-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in rat hearts. In contrast, increased fibrosis with diastolic dysfunction and diminished cardiac reserve were observed after six months of alternate-day fasting [42].",11c41a42-8d5f-42f2-8d73-efaf389a8767
16,discussion1,"  Body weight in intermittently fasted rats is usually lower than their ad libitum fed counterparts [13, 14]. In this study, AL/IF and IF groups had body weights approximately 18% lower than AL. However, body weight did not differ between rats that were subjected to intermittent fasting for 12 and 24 weeks showing that body weight loss following intermittent fasting is limited.  We have previously characterized myocardial infarction-induced cardiac remodeling in rats with large infarction size, usually characterized as an infarcted area greater than 40% of total LV area [15, 43, 44]. Six months after MI induction, rats with large MI present LV and left atrial dilation, LV diastolic posterior wall thickness increase, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction [15, 31, 43]. Feeding regimen in this study did not change MI size as all groups had large infarction size. This finding diverges from those by Ahmet et al.",cdc74a41-12c6-4ef4-9097-b397ec0a65a9
17,discussion2," [13] who found smaller infarction size in intermittent fasted rats 24 h after MI induction. Our first evaluation of MI size was performed two weeks after MI. At this time, mortality was lower in IF than AL and AL/IF groups. Therefore, it is possible that rats with larger MI size in AL and AL/IF groups had already died before our first evaluation. Mortality throughout the 12 weeks post-infarction was lower in IF than AL; the AL/IF group had intermediate mortality and did not differ from both AL and IF groups.  Two weeks after MI induction, echocardiographic parameters did not differ between groups, except for a higher isovolumic relaxation time in the IF group. Twelve weeks after MI, LV diastolic posterior wall thickness was lower in AL/IF and IF than AL, showing that intermittent fasting attenuated myocardial hypertrophy. This finding was corroborated by lower myocyte diameter in both AL/IF and IF groups.",c7c73ca1-7b0f-49f1-88fe-92f51aeb50a7
18,discussion3," When comparing changes in echocardiographic parameters between twelve and two weeks post-infarction, IF had a better remodeling than AL and AL/IF. This was characterized by a decrease in Δ E-wave and in Δ MI size and an increase in Δ E-wave deceleration time (E wave deceleration time (EDT)). As E/A ratio increases and E wave deceleration time (EDT) decreases in large infarctions [43], the changes in these parameters between both evaluations suggest a beneficial effect of intermittent fasting on diastolic function.  Results from Langendorff preparations confirmed a better effect of intermittent fasting when started before MI. V0 and V25 were lower in both intermittent fasted groups and V25 was lower in IF than AL/IF. These parameters indicate the LV volume at zero and 25 mmHg end-diastolic pressure, respectively. Furthermore, LV weight/V0 ratio was higher and V0/body weight ratio lower in IF than AL, suggesting a predominance of concentric over eccentric remodeling in the IF group.",778dcda3-2e44-419f-a6df-2f2152ac3dfd
19,discussion4," These data show that, despite the same MI size and therefore the same degree of ischemia-induced myocardial injury, intermittent fasting reduced LV cavity size, thus attenuating cardiac remodeling, and this attenuation was more intense in IF than AL/IF.  As potential mechanisms involved in cardiac remodeling attenuation, we evaluated myocardial expression of fetal genes and cardiac fibrosis. Interestingly, improvement in cardiac remodeling was not associated with changes in expression of the fetal genes α- and β-myosin heavy chain, atrial natriuretic peptide or Serca 2a. Reactivation of the fetal gene program is considered to be involved in adverse cardiac remodeling and the pathogenesis of heart failure [45]. Therefore, our results show that fetal gene program changes are not modulated by intermittent fasting. In the same way, myocardial hydroxyproline concentration, a marker of interstitial fibrosis, was not affected by dietary intervention.",d12acd56-da7f-49ae-a40e-cad67e8be097
20,discussion5," The effect of intermittent fasting on myocardial fibrosis is controversial, as both increased [42] and reduced [40] fibrosis was observed in healthy rats.  Attenuation of cardiac remodeling has previously been observed in rats subjected to intermittent fasting either before MI induction [13] or two weeks after MI [14]. As Ahmet et al. [13] reported, intermittent fasting reduced MI size therefore attenuating all aspects of cardiac remodeling. However, even in rats with similar MI sizes, intermittent fasting reduced myocyte apoptosis and neutrophil infiltration in the area at ischemia risk when compared to the ad libitum regimen [13].  Intermittent fasting initiated two weeks after MI accelerated pro-angiogenic and cell survive cascades [14]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the effects of intermittent fasting initiated before MI are more evident than when initiated after MI.",60b20001-0b98-4c93-a083-c5168de9e66e
21,discussion6," Although both regimens decreased mortality, only when started before MI did intermittent fasting reach statistical significance. Both fasting regimens reduced myocyte hypertrophy and LV dilation. However, the IF group also had evidence of decreased MI size, concentric remodeling predominating over eccentric remodeling, and better diastolic function evolution than AL/IF rats. Additional studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the attenuation of myocardial infarction-induced cardiac remodeling.  Conclusion Intermittent fasting initiated before or after myocardial infarction reduces myocyte hypertrophy and left ventricular dilation in rats. Myocardial fibrosis and fetal gene expression are not modulated by the feeding regimens. Benefit is more evident when intermittent fasting is initiated before than after myocardial infarction.",4762beda-05e4-4faf-b56e-29fe2c5dadf0
