0,background0," Aging is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic changes, increasing the susceptibility to acute myocardial infarction (acute myocardial infarction (AMI)). Intermittent fasting (IF) has a beneficial effect on the age-associated cardiovascular diseases. The present study was planned to investigate the possible protective effect of IF against acute acute myocardial infarction (AMI) induced by isoproterenol (isoproterenol (ISO)) in old rats and its possible underlying mechanisms mediated by heart and pancreatic autophagy. Thirty Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: adult; old; Old-isoproterenol (ISO) (rats subjected to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by isoproterenol (ISO)) and Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) groups (rats were subjected to IF for 4 weeks and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by isoproterenol (ISO)).

18,discussion0," Aging undermines cardiovascular homeostasis by enhancing slow and progressive functional and structural alterations of the heart, along with increased oxidative stress and inflammation; all of which promote the susceptibility to develop acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [11, 24]. Old rats in the present study showed a significantly higher level of the troponin-I associated with a significantly lower level of the heart glutathione (GSH) compared to adult group, denoting cardiac tissue damage and diminished antioxidant defense mechanism in aged hearts. Also, histopathological examination of left ventricles of old group showed a mild to moderate inflammatory changes which could be explained by the decrease in the heart glutathione (GSH) and shift of oxidant/antioxidant balance toward oxidative stress.  Decreased autophagy has been implicated in enhancing cardiovascular aging and increased liability to cardiovascular diseases [10, 25].",c5b6d3a5-0f70-40e8-b220-c8567f9c6d19
19,discussion1," Impaired autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins produces mitochondrial injury, oxidative stress, increased inflammation, decreased ventricular contraction, and reduced tolerance to ischemic stress [26]. Old rats in the current work did not exhibit any significant change in mRNA expression of the cardiac autophagy marker, Atg-5, versus adult group. However, IF for 4 weeks significantly upregulated the cardiac autophagy, as evidenced by the significant increase in the mRNA expression of heart Atg-5 in Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) group compared to old group, reaching levels significantly higher than those of adult values. Such chronic activation of the cardiac autophagy was associated with a significant decrease in serum levels of troponin-I, CK-MB in Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) group compared to Old-isoproterenol (ISO) rats, approaching the levels of adult group.",fcf98eab-2b25-4482-8df2-e1b49773d974
20,discussion2," These results indicate that long-term activation of autophagy by IF could provide a potential cardioprotective effect against acute acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in old rats. In line with these findings, Godar et al. demonstrated that IF protects against cardiac injury in mice (during ischemia/reperfusion) through increasing autophagic flux by stimulating nuclear translocation of TFEB, a master regulator of autophagy-lysosome gene expression networks [27].  Earlier studies have considered energy deprivation, oxidative stress and inflammation as serious events that take place during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and exaggerate cardiac injury.",aca2273e-491d-439d-8f2f-e02432483665
21,discussion3," Lack of energy causes inhibition of Na+–K+ pump, increase in intracellular level of Ca2+, and mitochondrial dysfunction; resulting in activation of proteases, cleavage of anchoring cytoskeletal proteins, and progressive increase in cell membrane permeability with release of intracellular troponin-I and creatine kinase into the circulation [28, 29]. Moreover, mitochondrial damage during ischemia is critical incident, represents a key source of ROS that enhance oxidative cardiac injury [30, 31]. Also, recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the area of infarction activates the inflammatory reaction and promotes the oxidative stress, exaggerating the tissue damage [32, 33].  Autophagy is a naturally regulated process of lysosome-dependent turnover of damaged proteins and organelles that allows orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components [34].",e311016b-6829-4236-956e-2e154a5dce57
22,discussion4," It begins with the engulfment of lipid droplets, ribosomes, soluble proteins, or organelles in a double membrane autophagosomes; that when combined with lysosomes, continued enzymolysis occurs [35]. The products of autophagy, basic new nutrients, such as lipids, amino acids, and sugars, are then transported into the cytoplasm, where they are used as a source of energy [36]. It is activated by starvation or metabolic stress for the maintenance of tissue functions and homeostasis [37]. Moreover, mitophagy, selective mitochondrial autophagy, is the only intracellular degradative mechanism for removing damaged mitochondria and their harmful ROS [38, 39]. Also, autophagy was found to have an anti-inflammatory effect that attenuates the progression of cardiac damage [10, 25].",4b411428-b53f-4ecf-b5b0-8f60f017fc95
23,discussion5," Hence, enhanced cardiac autophagy in Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) group, in the current work, might provide a cardioprotective effect in response to isoproterenol (ISO) administration possibly by ensuring adequate nutrient supply under the circumstances of energy depletion, alleviating the local inflammatory reaction and by decreasing the cardiac oxidative tissue damage, perhaps via removing the damaged mitochondria, a fundamental source of ROS. In line with this assumption, the cardiac levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and TNF-α were significantly decreased in Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) compared to Old-isoproterenol (ISO) group, in concomitance with increased expression of heart Atg-5. Additionally, Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) group exhibited a significantly higher heart levels of the antioxidant enzyme, glutathione (GSH), compared to old group.",697d22b4-5a97-4c16-98be-e5d32c58c429
24,discussion6," Moreover, histopathological studies, herein, revealed that IF can alleviate the local inflammatory response in Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) versus Old-isoproterenol (ISO) group as manifested histologically by the attenuation of edema.  Furthermore, attenuation of autophagy in beta cells of pancreas was recorded during aging and was assumed to induce age-related diabetic changes such as decreased insulin secretion, decreased beta cell mass and function, and hyperglycemia [40, 41]; well-known risk factors for ischemic heart disease [42]. Diabetes mellitus is known to proceed in stages characterized by alteration in blood glucose level, decrease in beta cell mass and function which progress gradually to significant hyperglycemia and frank diabetes with ketosis [43].",56746eef-1d51-4772-8929-902ef502a564
25,discussion7," Although old rats in the present study did not present full picture of frank diabetes mellitus, they exhibited some criteria of age-related diabetic changes, manifested as a significant decrease in serum insulin level compared to adult group, associated with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and low HOMA-B%. IF significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of Atg-7 in the pancreas of Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) group versus old rats, reaching a level significantly higher than adult values, reflecting an increase in pancreatic autophagy. This was associated with a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) group when compared to old or Old-isoproterenol (ISO) groups. Also, enhancement of beta cell function was evident by IF, manifested as a significant increase in HOMA-B% in Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) compared to old group, reaching a level significantly higher than that of adult rats.",0e2d1f6e-aecb-48af-a7f5-1f6b38742e74
26,discussion8," These observations suggest improved glycemic control by IF which might be induced by activation of pancreatic autophagy.  Autophagy has a fundamental homeostatic role necessary to maintain the structure, mass and function of pancreatic beta cells [44]. Hyperglycemia was reported to produce endoplasmic reticulum stress in β-cells [45], which enhances intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins and promotes apoptosis [46]. Autophagy was found to have a role in the removal of harmful misfolded protein aggregates by directing cytosolic contents to the lysosome for degradation [47].  Hyperglycemia is a serious risk factor for coronary heart disease and is strongly related to the high mortality rate in patients with acute MI [48]. Previous studies reported that hyperglycemia can produce a direct damaging effect on ischemic myocardium by reducing collateral circulation, increasing infarct size [49], and enhancing apoptosis [50].",9e15d0f6-70cf-4808-932c-43a5a15f3992
27,discussion9," Controlling hyperglycemia was found to produce a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality of acute acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patient [51]. Therefore, upregulation of the pancreatic autophagy by IF, in the present study, might assign an additional protective mechanism against acute acute myocardial infarction (AMI) induced by isoproterenol (ISO) via amelioration of the hyperglycemia in old rats.  The present non-significant changes in heart and pancreatic autophagy in old group versus adult rats, despite the presence of cardiac injury as well as diabetic changes, notify that age-related cardiovascular and metabolic alteration could be mediated by other risk factors rather than altered autophagy. In the present study, an obvious increase in obesity markers (significant increase in final BW, body mass index (BMI) and WC) was significantly recorded in old versus adult group.",8718eaf7-53b8-423e-bad4-17ebd33c58e9

These findings indicate a decrease in overall and visceral obesity by IF in old rats.  The association between obesity and aging has been demonstrated by previous studies [52, 53]. Obesity, particularly visceral obesity, is the cornerstone for metabolic disorders which provokes the onset of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia [54, 55], imposing a great burden on the cardiovascular system, and increasing the susceptibility to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during aging [56]. IF diet regimens were found to reduce the risk of obesity both in animal [57] and human studies [58].",d12a3d8b-f65d-4229-82d0-a514c8f892a6
29,discussion11," IF was found to improve indicators of coronary heart disease in obese men and women, such as reducing body weight, waist circumference, and body fat mass [59]. Previous reports have recorded a cardioprotective impact of IF diet and attributed such effect to the reduction in fat tissue, especially visceral fat tissue [60, 61]. Moreover, IF increases the utilization of fat, directing the body metabolism toward a ketogenic state that increases weight loss, as processing ketones consumes high energy [62]. Therefore, attenuation of the age-related obesity, herein, represents another cardioprotective mechanism of IF, alleviating the severity of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).",fdc34b55-44f4-4c97-a0b4-b38c7e7e982f
30,discussion12,"  Importantly, Old-isoproterenol (ISO) group, in the present study, presented a significantly higher levels of cardiac injury markers (Troponin-I and CK-MB); cardiac levels of oxidative stress marker (malondialdehyde (MDA)) and proinflammatory marker (TNF-α) in association with a significant increase in mRNA expression of heart Atg-5 versus old and adult groups. Similarly, pancreatic autophagy marker Atg-7 was significantly increased in Old-isoproterenol (ISO) group in comparison with both old and adult groups. Of note, autophagy, together with apoptosis and necrosis, plays a dichotomous ‘survival and death’ role in cell homeostasis [63]. Despite, it is activated in ischemic stress in attempt to conserve cardiomyocyte in face of ischemic injury [64], excessive autophagy may be harmful by increasing cell death, a process called autosis [55].",e44fc0a8-274c-4dc7-99d0-7070aae0cfc9
31,discussion13," Moreover, excessive activation of autophagy may lead to a detrimental effect on the heart during cardiac ischemia, as well as during the reperfusion stage [65]. Additionally, overstimulation of autophagy was found to impair beta cell function in vitro and in vivo studies [66]. Unregulated autophagy can be deleterious and result in autophagic cell death [67]. Therefore, the current cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue damage in association with upregulation of Atg-5, observed in Old-isoproterenol (ISO) group, might be explained by the acute stimulation of autophagy during acute cardiac ischemia. Likewise, the pancreatic stress induced by ischemic changes during acute acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Old-isoproterenol (ISO) group sharply overstimulated the pancreatic autophagy which might damage beta cells, particularly, these rats presented a significantly high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) group.",3ccd04e5-a434-4132-aca1-2226d0935c91
32,discussion14," On the other hand, long-term activation of both heart and pancreatic autophagy markers by IF, herein, afford a protective mechanisms against acute cardiac insult in Old-F-isoproterenol (ISO) group.  Conclusions  IF increases the tolerance of aged myocardium to acute cardiac insult induced by isoproterenol (ISO) administration in old rats, possibly by activation of both cardiac and pancreatic autophagy, ensuring sufficient energy supply to the heart, decreasing the cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation, and alleviating the age-related diabetic changes. Also, amelioration of age-related overall and visceral obesity could be an additional mechanism of IF, which afford protection against acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Hence, IF could be a dietary lifestyle modification for attenuation of the susceptibility to acute acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in aged population.",9edf0bb6-4a1e-4af0-870b-e9b40a6b8e8c
33,discussion15," Moreover, this study indicates the controversial effect of autophagy, providing evidence that chronic rather than acute activation of both cardiac and pancreatic autophagy may potentially confer such cardioprotective effect against acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
