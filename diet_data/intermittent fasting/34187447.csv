0,background0," Intermittent fasting (IF) is a dietary approach that is widely popular due to its effects on weight and body fat loss, but it does not appear to ensure muscle mass preservation. Incorporating high-intensity interval training (high intensity interval training (HIIT)) into an individual’s routine could be an attractive and viable therapeutic option for improving body composition, lifestyle and health promotion. Problematizing the emerging situation of fighting obesity, led us to clarify gaps about IF and hypothesize that IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) in conjunction may protect against muscle mass decline without impairing nitrogen balance (NB), in addition to improving the physical fitness of women with obesity.  Objectives  To evaluate the effects of IF alone and combined with high intensity interval training (HIIT) on body composition, NB and strength and physical fitness in women with obesity.

1,methods0," Thirty-six women (BMI 34.0 ± 3.2; 32.2 ± 4.4 years) participated and were randomly distributed into three groups: (1) Intermittent fasting combined with exercise group (IF + EX); (2) Exercise group (EX); and (3) Intermittent fasting group (IF). The interventions took place over 8 weeks and all evaluations were performed pre and post-intervention. The high intensity interval training (HIIT) circuit was performed 3x/week, for 25 mins/session, at 70–85% of the maximum heart rate. The intermittent fasting protocol was a 5:2 diet with two meals within 6 h on fasting days, being 25% of total energy intake, plus 18 h of complete fasting. The protocol was performed 2x/week and 5 days of ad libitum ingestion. Resting metabolic rate (Resting metabolic rate (RMR)) was measured by indirect calorimetry, body composition by BodPod®, NB from urinary nitrogen, food consumption by food records and physical and strength performance were measured by physical tests.",eee7c92f-76bf-4cf4-bc98-0542aa45964f
2,methods1," ANOVA two-way repeated measures mixed model was performed followed by Sidak post hoc (p < 0.05). This project was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05237154.   Study Design and Subjects  A randomized study was conducted. Participants were recruited through adverts on social networks. Thirty-six women with obesity degree one according to their body mass index (BMI 34.0 ± 3.2; 32.2 ± 4.4 years old) participated in this study. Exclusion criteria were: having a diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, osteoarthritis, gastritis; smokers; alcoholics; using regular medications; who were undergoing weight loss treatment; lack of availability for training and meetings; who reported malaise during long periods of fasting; and being <18 years or >40 years. The Ethics Committee of the School of Physical Education and Sport of Ribeirão Preto (EEFERP-USP) and of the University Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto approved the study (nos. 13359319.3.0000.",618c5c00-eeea-48bb-83ed-e4bce62ebc7b

This project was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05237154.  Participants were evaluated pre and post-interventions with exercise and/or IF that lasted 8 weeks. All post-intervention assessments were performed 48 h after the last exercise session and/or the last day of the IF protocol. A random draw was performed and the participants were divided into three groups; the intermittent fasting associated with physical exercise group (IF + EX, n = 15), the physical exercise group (EX, n = 11), and the intermittent fasting group (IF, n = 10), totaling 36 participants. The study was widely disseminated and initially attracted a high number of individuals.",cdbfbdb1-1519-45dd-aafa-7c0c53d47d37
4,methods3," However, after strictly applying the eligibility criteria, the present study started with a total of 60 participants, of which only 36 completed all stages. There was a high number of dropouts, leading in a considerable sample loss (Figure 1).  FIGURE 1 Flow diagram. IF + EX, intermittent fasting group associated with exercise; EX, exercise group; IF, intermittent fasting group.  Sample Size  For the methodological planning of the study, the sample size was calculated based on a randomized, controlled, parallel-arm study conducted by Bhutani et al. (22), who demonstrated that the combination of Alternate Day Fasting (ADF) plus exercise produces superior changes in body composition. The sample size calculation was adequate to the statistical model planned for the present study (ANOVA two-way repeated measures with mixed effects) considering the fat-free mass as a variable of primary interest.",787909e3-d365-42e4-9da3-e55a3603ecb4
5,methods4," For the present study, twenty-one subjects in total (seven subjects per group) were calculated as the minimum sample to evaluate the primary outcome variables, with a mean difference of 0.66 (SD 0.58), a significance level of 0.05, and a statistical power of 80%.  Interventions  Intermittent Fasting  The 5:2 intermittent fasting protocol was used, performed twice a week, on non-consecutive days, for 8-weeks of intervention (17, 24). The participants consumed 25% of the total daily energy needs on IF days (approximate total of 600 kcal that were divided into two meals), while on the other days of the week food was allowed ad libitum. The calculation of the average of the total energy expenditure (total energy expenditure (TEE)) was performed from the average of the resting metabolic rate (Resting metabolic rate (RMR)), obtained by indirect calorimetry, of each group that would be submitted to the protocol, multiplied by the activity factor of 1.2 for sedentary individuals (25).",abab30a5-30a1-4728-a8d0-a462eea48e86
6,methods5," The IF protocol consisted of 6:18 h, with a 6 h eating period, during which participants were only allowed to consumption of two meals, followed by 18 h of complete fasting, when participants were able to ingest only water, and tea and coffee without sugar. Participants received a list of meal options duly calculated at 300 kcal each to be chosen on IF days and received the necessary counseling. The distribution of macronutrients prioritized the offer of 40% of protein sources on the menu of the IF protocol delivered to the participants. Weekly meetings were held with the groups to monitor the follow-up of the intervention. The EX-group was instructed to maintain usual eating habits throughout the intervention period. In Supplementary Material 1 are two examples of two meals consumed on the days of the IF protocol.  High-Intensity Interval Training  High-intensity interval training was performed on a circuit, adapted according to Sperlich et al.",626b3dbd-fa02-4d4e-9550-5dbfd1d3ff87
7,methods6," (19) and the training sessions were carried out at the multisport gym at the University of São Paulo (Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil), being fully supervised by a physical education professional. The progressive training protocol was performed 3x/week, for 8 weeks, with at least 1 day of rest between sessions and a duration of 25 mins each session, with 4 mins of initial warm-up, 18 mins for the main part, and 3 mins of relaxation (see Table 1 for additional details). In the first and second weeks, the exercise execution and recovery times were 30 s. In the third and fourth weeks, the execution time was 35 s and the recovery time was 25 s. In the fifth and sixth weeks, the execution time was 40 s and the recovery time was 20 s. In the seventh and eighth weeks, the execution time was 45 s and the recovery time was 15 s. Each session consisted of a circuit with nine exercises and the participants were required to complete two laps of the circuit.",e307f1b0-b240-44fa-b82f-7a7dd2264a3a
8,methods7," The training intensity was maintained at between 70 and 85% of the maximum heart rate (HRmax) previously determined by a performance Shuttle Walking test.

11,methods10,"  Assessments  Nutritional Assessment  Anthropometry was based on the measurement of weight, height using a Filizola™ electronic platform scale (Filizola SA, São Paulo, Brazil), BMI, and waist (midpoint between the last rib and the iliac crest), abdominal (abdominal region at its greatest perimeter measured over the umbilicus or 2 cm above) and hip circumferences (27). Body composition was assessed using the whole-body air displacement plethysmography method, BodPod® (Life Measurement Incorporation©, Body Composition Tracking System, United States). The equipment was properly calibrated and then the participant’s body weight was determined using the BodPod® weighing scale. All participants received specific clothing for the use of the equipment, including shorts, a gymnastics top, and a cap, and were instructed not to wear metallic objects during the assessment (28). All measurements were performed pre and post-intervention.",5f59c678-f545-4755-a1af-7e17941621a9
12,methods11,"  Dietary Intake  All participants in the three groups were instructed to complete the food record on three non-consecutive days; one day of the week that included the intermittent fasting protocol, another day of the week with ad libitum food, and a weekend day. The assessment of dietary intake occurred pre intervention, in the fourth week and post-intervention. Dietary data were analyzed using Dietwin® software (São Paulo, Brazil) to calculate caloric intake and macronutrients.  Resting Metabolic Rate and Lipid Oxidation  Resting Metabolic Rate (Resting metabolic rate (RMR)) was assessed by indirect calorimetry using QUARK-Resting metabolic rate (RMR) equipment (COSMED, Rome, Italy) (29). The participants remained at rest for 30 mins prior to the assessment. During the evaluation, the participants remained awake, in the supine position, in a quiet room, with a temperature between 21 and 24°C, under low lighting. All measurements were performed between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.",a618385b-b9af-4c9f-be4b-3e3c976f9cf9
13,methods12," The women were instructed to fast for 8–10 h, not to perform any physical exercise, and not to drink coffee or black tea for 24 h before the evaluation. The equipment was automatically calibrated with known gas concentrations before all evaluations, according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The volumes of oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were measured for 20 mins. The measurements obtained in the first 5 mins were discarded to ensure that the participant reached an equilibrium state. The Weir equation (30) was used to estimate the Resting metabolic rate (RMR). Lipid oxidation rates were calculated according to the formulas described by Frayn (31): Lipid oxidation (g/day) = [(1.67 × VO2) – (1.67 × VCO2)] × 1,440.",907cde5d-4cf1-4e5c-bd51-5441e0b45103
14,methods13,"  Blood Collection and Biochemical Analyses  After 8–10 h of fasting, a sample of 4 mL of blood was collected in EDTA tubes and used to determine glycemia, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-c, quantified by Labtest diagnostics® kits, using an enzymatic system and absorbance spectrophotometer. The calculation of the LDL-cholesterol fraction (LDL-c) was performed using the Friedewald formula: [LDL-c = (CT – HDL-c) – (TG/5)] (32).  Urinary Nitrogen  Samples of 5 μl of 24-h urine collection were diluted in 495 μl of hydrochloric acid (100 mM), representing a 100-fold dilution and if necessary, the solution was diluted 200, 300, 400, or even 600-fold. Next, the determination of total urinary nitrogen was performed by the pyro-chemiluminescence method (33). The measurement of urinary nitrogen associated with the results of protein intake allowed the calculation of nitrogen balance (NB) using the following equation: NB = [PTN 24 h (g)/(6.",33568f53-2e9b-48ac-b9cd-3f0545bd369d
15,methods14,"25)] – Urinary Nitrogen 24 h (g) + 4 (g) (20).  Physical Tests  All tests were performed pre and post-intervention. Aerobic performance was assessed by an adapted incremental Shuttle Walking test (34) and the estimated maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) was determined according to Lima et al. (35). HRmax and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded at the beginning, at each stage, and at the end of the test. Maximum dynamic muscle strength was assessed by the multiple maximal repetitions (RM) test in the 45° leg press and bench press. The calculation of the maximum load and the percentage were performed according to Brzycki’s equations (36). The maximum isometric muscle strength of the dorsal region and handgrip were assessed by dynamometry, using a crown dorsal dynamometer (Osvaldo Filizola, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) and a manual hydraulic dynamometer (SH5001, Saehan Corporation, Yangdeok-Dong, Masan, Korea), respectively (37).",bfbfc90e-0a9f-44c0-83f4-7864bb2f5a2c
16,methods15," To assess the strength resistance capacity, 1-min functional tests were performed for the abdominal, free squat, and arm flexion exercises, in which the greatest number of repetitions were required to be performed in the time interval for each exercise.  In all physical tests, participants were verbally encouraged in order to achieve the best execution performance.  Statistical Analysis  After testing the assumptions of normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test and sphericity, the ANOVA two-way repeated measures mixed model for intra and intergroup comparisons was performed, followed by the Sidak post hoc in cases of group × time interaction (SPSS Statistics 20® software). The Wilcoxon test was applied in cases of non-parametric distribution for intra-group comparisons and the Mann-Whitney test for comparisons between groups. To characterize the subjects, the ANOVA one-way test was performed. ANOVA with Welch’s correction was performed for cases of heteroscedasticity.",f03a24bb-ed05-43a2-a495-c614a9974180

18,results0," Dropouts Reasons  A high number of dropouts before completing the 8 weeks of intervention was observed, being 25% in the IF + EX group, 45% in the EX group, and 50% in the IF group. We defend the idea that the main reasons that led to the high dropout rates are not supported by the low adherence to the exercise and/or IF protocol for the most part, since, in the IF + EX group we observed that 25% of the dropouts were absent from training without giving any justification, but no feedback of low adherence to the diet was reported in this group. The IF + EX group could have less tolerated the intervention period, however, the fact that this group had the dropout rate lowest does not surprise us, as we understand that physical exercise works as a motivational tool even more when combined with a nutritional intervention, especially in the obese population.",6c8e1f84-315e-4ce8-a43d-f90903457764
19,results1," In previous studies from our research group, we observed that the exercise group always had the lowest dropout rates when compared to a control group (no intervention) or another intervention. Furthermore, of the nine participants who dropped out of the intervention in the EX group, only 3 (33.3% of dropouts) dropped out due to loss to follow-up, low adherence, while the other six participants (66.6% of dropouts) did not justify dropping out of the study or had personal problems or time conflicts to attend training (unavailability).",cc450c67-92c1-4b96-911e-a999664bd31b
20,results2," Finally, of the 10 dropouts from the IF group, 5 (50% of dropouts) had a direct relationship with the proposed protocol, with only three individuals justifying low acceptance of the diet due to side effects of the long period of fasting (such as dizziness and headaches) and two other participants justified loss to follow-up due to routine conflicts at work in consuming time-restricted food (6 h) prior to 18 h of complete fasting, but not due to low adherence to the IF. The other five participants (50% of the dropouts) presented other reasons, such as the presence of diseases or simply being absent from the study, but unrelated to the IF protocol itself. The high number of dropouts in the IF group may have had a substantial impact on the absence of effects in this group.  We highlight how challenging it is to design the best motivational strategies capable of alleviating dropout problems in randomized and well-controlled clinical trials such as in the current study.",42f63207-2e0d-416d-9f6d-2fd5d470c67b

29,discussion0," The main findings of the present study were: (a) weight loss after 8 weeks of IF combined with high intensity interval training (HIIT) training; (b) IF combined with high intensity interval training (HIIT) training promoted a greater gain in fat-free mass and greater loss of body fat than exercise in isolation, which was also able to improve body composition; (c) NB remained in equilibrium; and (d) high intensity interval training (HIIT) improved aerobic fitness and muscle strength.  Stekovic et al. (38) in a prospective cohort study, found no significant differences in resting energy expenditure in individuals without obesity undergoing Alternate Day Fasting (ADF) for 4 weeks, but in the present investigation was observed that the IF alone, without the action of the exercise, reduced the Resting metabolic rate (RMR). The authors also observed improvement in the fat mass/lean mass ratio, as reported in our results, and in cardiovascular disease parameters.",7cc7b821-8fea-45b8-90d0-aade7a1b6afe
30,discussion1," Recently, scientists revealed that an IF protocol involving a restricted diet within a 10-h window with 14 h of fasting in patients with metabolic syndrome and the absence of physical exercise, led to a significant reduction in body weight, which does not corroborate the results of the present work, because again, isolated IF did not affect changes in body composition or weight loss, but a significant improvement in waist circumference was observed, as in the present investigation (39).  Bhutani et al. (22) found that the effects of interventions of Alternate Day Fasting (ADF) and endurance exercise in individuals with obesity for 12 weeks were more promising when combined and not when evaluated in isolation. In this sense, the authors observed −6 kg weight loss in the group that combined IF with exercise, −1 kg in the exercise group, and −3 kg for the IF group.",c48ec664-f13b-4d5f-b55e-6639f4cddb3c
31,discussion2," We did not find weight loss with IF and EX performed alone, only when together (IF + EX), besides better metabolic outcomes with IF acting synergistically with exercise. According to the authors the group that performed the IF combined with exercise lost more body fat (−5 kg) compared to individuals who underwent only the IF (−2 kg), but the endurance training was not as efficient in improving body composition as the high intensity interval training (HIIT) training achieved in the present study, as Bhutani et al. (22) did not find a loss of body fat in the exercise group or a gain in lean mass in any of the groups evaluated.  The present study highlights encouraging outcomes regarding the fat-free mass gain observed in women with obesity undergoing IF associated with high intensity interval training (HIIT), and we draw attention to the importance of preserving fat-free mass and a better lifestyle when an intermittent fasting is linked to physical exercise.",40ee9aaf-ab4d-4a0a-889f-f8e3573eb10a
32,discussion3," A recent review broadly contributes to understanding the effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) in increasing lean/fat free mass (40). Although no positive changes in body composition were observed with the isolated IF, the present intervention also did not lead to loss of fat-free mass, as observed in the clinical trial by Lowe et al. (41). The authors found a significant reduction in lean mass (calculated as fat-free mass minus bone mineral content) in subjects with overweight and obesity submitted to the Time-Restricted Eating protocol, a type of IF, for 12 weeks. In addition, they drew attention to the high proportion of lean mass loss, representing approximately 65% of observed weight loss, and that commonly the lean mass reduction during weight loss accounts for only 20–30% (42).",2b14b101-9dcf-4ef8-8566-37395f1c6b62
33,discussion4,"  It has been reported that continuous caloric restriction or intermittent fasting strategies can affect energy metabolism, reducing the resting metabolic rate (43, 44), as observed in the IF group of the present study. Although the isolated IF did not result in weight loss or improvement in body composition, it is possible to state that the participants performed the proposed protocol considering that the Resting metabolic rate (RMR) reduced by 8.1% (Δ) post-intervention. On the other hand, exercise played an important role in preserving energy expenditure, even under caloric restriction.  Regarding NB, all groups presented neutral NB, ranging between −4 and +4 (21) throughout the intervention, suggesting that the protein intake offered on fasting days associated with exercise was sufficient to maintain NB equilibrium and that the NB was also in agreement with the individuals’ usual caloric intake.",032ccdb2-5067-4a89-8f3c-c6d0c8e7c79d
34,discussion5," The protein intake was in accordance with the recommendations according to the Dietary Reference Intakes - DRIs (0.8–1.0 g/kg/day) (25) corroborating with other authors (10) and added to the exercise efficiency, leading to a lower risk of fat free mass depletion. This is the first study to evaluate NB against an IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol in women with obesity. The results of Campbell et al. (18), who evaluated the effect of continuous caloric restriction associated with resistance exercise in women with overweight or obesity for 16 weeks, corroborate our findings by observing neutral nitrogen balance during the caloric restriction process. Meckling and Sherfey (45) also evaluated the NB of women with obesity submitted to exercise and a low-calorie diet for 12 weeks and also found neutral NB and adequate protein intake.",29846ab5-e983-47a7-9d1d-fff948b7b41f
35,discussion6,"  The results of food consumption were favorable, as there was no caloric surplus in the ad libitum periods, since we did not observe changes in energy and carbohydrate intake and we still found significantly reduced lipid consumption after 8 weeks of IF in the absence of exercise. These outcomes are in line with other studies that evaluated reduced or increased hunger on unrestricted days without changes in energy intake (44, 46).  High-intensity interval training and the achievement of simultaneous gains in muscle mass and cardiorespiratory capacity is still not clear (40) and the present investigation contributes, from a metabolic point of view, to the obscurity of these aspects. Steckling et al. (47) in line with our findings, also considered high intensity interval training (HIIT) training as an efficient strategy to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and functional parameters of individuals with obesity.",64ae063e-10e9-4360-a31a-642ba20a7015
36,discussion7," Studies show that high intensity interval training (HIIT) requires less time than conventional moderate-intensity exercise options to obtain health benefits including increased aerobic fitness which corroborates with the present study (48–50).  Adherence to a dietary intervention has been widely discussed in the context of obesity. There are several aspects that can influence adherence to a dietary protocol, such as food preferences, food availability, and, especially, the triggers that motivate the individual to maintain or change the diet. Undeniably, behavioral factors and environments also govern the degree of commitment of the individual. The fact is that strategies capable of improving adherence to diets are strongly linked to the success of these dietary therapies for weight loss, improvement in body composition, and health gains in general (51).",a449eb4b-7bf6-4a53-bba7-7d5a9680e454
37,discussion8," In the present study, we observed a high number of dropouts in the three groups, but especially in the IF group, which means that there was low adherence to the proposed protocol. Adherence to IF is challenging and some aspects such as susceptibility to over-eating and possible adverse effects, have been associated with loss to follow-up or discontinued intervention in different IF protocols (50, 52).  In agreement with the present study, Bhutani et al. (22) and Jospe et al. (10) also found greater dropouts in the IF group and in the case of Bhutani et al. (22) when IF was combined with exercise, the authors also found that adherence was greater. Although the number of dropouts in the IF group was high, it is important to note that the loss to follow-up did not only occur due to the intervention, as there were other reasons. Intervention time is another point that deserves attention and is closely linked to motivational issues, which in obesity is something very complex.",fccf7d71-bd2a-4d0d-a9f4-b960e89ef9b8
38,discussion9," IF protocols applied for a long period, such as 12 months, tend to reduce adherence or stall the effects of weight loss (10), while interventions with shorter periods of time may affect diet adherence less, a fact that was not observed in the present 8-week intervention. In addition, as in the present study, other authors have also revealed physical exercise as an important motivational tool, even more so when linked to nutritional intervention, clearly superior to diet and exercise programs applied alone (22, 53), since we demonstrated the lowest dropout rates from the study in the group submitted to IF and exercise.  We emphasize that the original hypothesis of the present study contributes to the scientific community, which includes few clinical trials in less controlled living conditions, compared to the vast majority of experimental studies.",bd028cc9-9fd5-4e62-bd01-8861f68aade4
39,discussion10," Evidence on the long-term effectiveness of the possible synergism found between IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) is still minimal, reinforcing the idea that it is necessary to explore and better clarify these strategies in obesity.  Study Limitations  The present study has limitations that deserve to be highlighted. We believe that performing a physical training protocol for a longer period may result in even better metabolic outcomes, since 8 weeks may be the beginning of post-adaptive physiological changes to exercise. In addition, the intermittent fasting protocol itself may have been limiting, as considering only 2 days a week of combined complete fasting with a restricted diet may not be enough to generate a caloric deficit representative for weight loss and improvements in body composition, considering the longer period of time with ad libitum eating.",a5c1c1d4-9e52-4f09-9835-bb487be976a8
40,discussion11," In addition, at baseline the EX group started the intervention with significantly lower body weight and BMI than the IF group, which means that these initial differences also represent a limitation of the study. Another limiting aspect was the encouragement given by the evaluators during the physical tests, despite all of them remaining blind to the treatments. The IF group did not perform the physical tests making it impossible for the outcomes of the physical capacities of this group to be compared with the other groups that performed the tests (IF + EX and EX) and in this aspect it is also a limitation. Still with regard to physical training, non-exercise activities were not monitored, but it is known that they commonly do not affect the outcomes of physical training. From the beginning, all participants were instructed not to perform any other structured exercise and the group submitted only to IF, to maintain a sedentary lifestyle throughout the intervention period.",6c00456c-8dd2-4059-9da0-c538300a01d4
41,discussion12,"  We emphasize that the sample size reached at the end of the study deserves to be reported as another limitation.  Conclusion  Combining IF with high intensity interval training (HIIT) can be a good strategy for increasing fat-free mass, reducing body fat and weight, promoting nitrogen balance equilibrium, and improving physical fitness and strength in women with obesity. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate these outcomes using a larger sample size for a longer intervention time. The present study presents important contributions to the scientific community, since it is one of the few studies with IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) in humans showing protection against the decline in fat-free mass, the first to evaluate the nitrogen balance under these intervention conditions, and also for promoting a non-sedentary lifestyle.",5c80f135-15cd-4e67-b944-6b5507d2c821
