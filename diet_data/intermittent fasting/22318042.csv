0,introduction0,"Coronary heart disease (coronary heart disease (CHD)) remains the number one of killer of women in the United States [1]. Weight gain during adulthood increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) [1]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a modest reduction in weight (i.e. 5% of body weight) in female subjects reduces the incidence and progression of coronary heart disease (CHD) [2]. Although several diet strategies exist to help individuals lose weight, one regimen that has gained considerable popularity in the past decade is intermittent fasting (IF) [3]. This diet strategy generally involves severe restriction (75-90% of energy needs) on 1 or 2 days per week. Results from a recent 24-week randomized clinical trial revealed that IF can reduce body weight by 7% in obese women [4]. LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations also decreased by 10% and 17%, respectively, in these subjects [4].",56fd5a5d-0b58-4994-ba62-31f6605fe2b0
1,introduction1," Though these findings are promising, this regimen is limited in that a long duration of time (i.e. 24 weeks) is required to experience only modest reductions in body weight. One possible method of augmenting the rate of weight loss is to combine IF with a daily calorie restriction (CR) protocol. In this way, the individual would fast one day per week, and then undergo mild CR (i.e. 20% restriction of energy needs) on 6 days per week. This combination therapy (IF plus CR) produces greater reductions in weight and superior changes in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk parameters when compared to each intervention alone in animal models [5]. Whether the beneficial effects of IF plus CR on weight and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk can be reproduced in human subjects has yet to be elucidated.  It is well known that many obese subjects are unable to adequately estimate portion sizes [6].",e2a55236-8c57-490f-9799-4e4c9bb4440c
2,introduction2," This inability to estimate portions during periods of dieting results in excessive food intake, which then blunts overall weight loss [6]. In order to take the guesswork out of estimating portion sizes, some CR protocols implement portion controlled liquid meals to replace 1 or 2 meals per day. When liquid meal replacements are employed, subjects tend to lose greater amounts of weight when compared to subjects receiving diet counseling alone [7,8]. Whether or not the implementation of liquid meal replacements during periods of IF plus CR accelerates weight loss remains unknown.  Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to examine the effects of an IF protocol combined with CR on body weight, body composition, and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in obese women. Whether the addition of liquid meal replacements to this protocol would result in greater weight loss and more pronounced coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction was also assessed.

5,methods2," The 10-week trial consisted of two dietary phases: 1) a 2-week baseline weight maintenance period, and 2) an 8-week weight loss period.  Diet protocol Baseline weight maintenance diet (Week 1–2) Before commencing the 8-week weight loss intervention, each subject participated in a 2-week baseline weight maintenance period. During this period, subjects were requested to maintain a stable weight and continue eating their usual diet.  Weight loss diets (Week 3–10) Following the baseline period, subjects participated in the IFCR-L or IFCR-F protocol for 8 weeks. Energy requirements were measured using the Mifflin equation [9]. IFCRL subjects (n = 30) consumed a calorie-restricted liquid diet for the first 6 days of the week, and then underwent a fast on the last day of the week (water consumption + 120 kcal of juice powder only, for 24 h).",16aa5ea0-b916-48c6-886a-25218dbb0e90

Waist circumference was measured by a flexible tape to the nearest 0.1 cm, midway between the lower costal margin and super iliac crest during a period of expiration. Abdominal visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes were quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) at week 3 and 10 [10]. Images were acquired using a 1.5-T superconducting magnet (Siemens, Iselin, NJ), and were obtained every 1 cm from the 9th thoracic vertebra (T9) to the first sacral vertebra (S1).

25,discussion0,"Our findings show, for the first time, that the combination of IF plus CR is an effective means of reducing body weight, fat mass, and visceral fat mass in obese women. This novel regimen also decreased key indicators of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, such as LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and the proportion of small LDL particles. When liquid meal replacements were incorporated into the IFCR regimen, greater reductions in body weight and indicators of heart disease risk were noted.  Studies of IF in human populations are very limited. To our knowledge, only two studies have examined the effect of IF on body weight [4,13]. In a trial conducted by Williams et al. [13], obese subjects consumed a very-low calorie diet (VLCD; <500 kcal/d) 1 day per week, and ate ad libitum every other day of the week. After 20 weeks of treatment, body weight decreased by 9% (9 kg) from baseline [13]. Similar decreases in body weight were also observed in a recent trial by Harvie et al. [4].",8c931365-f71e-441e-ac34-208c68c33774
26,discussion1," In this study, obese women underwent 2 days of VLCD (600 kcal/d) and ate ad libitum on every other day of the week, for 24 weeks [4]. Body weight was reduced by 7% (6 kg), fat mass decreased by 13% (4 kg), and waist circumference (an indirect indicator of visceral fat) decreased by 6% (6 cm) [4]. In the present study, we observed modest weight loss in both the IFCR-L and IFCR-F groups after 8 weeks of treatment. We also observed that the addition of liquid meals to the protocol resulted in greater weight loss (IFCR-L group: 4.1% weight loss versus IFCR-F group: 2.6% weight loss). Reductions in fat mass and visceral fat mass were also demonstrated at the end of the trial, but did not differ between groups. As for fat free mass, no significant changes were noted in either intervention group. This is surprising as a previous study that implemented energy restricted liquid meals observed small but significant decreases in fat free mass (i.e.",e54cdeb3-1137-4ce5-871d-d81813887af3
27,discussion2," 3% reductions from baseline) after 8 weeks of treatment [14]. The greater weight loss by the IFCR-L intervention is most likely due to better dietary adherence. Analysis of food intake revealed a greater degree of energy restriction in the IFCR-L group (29%) compared to the IFCR-F group (22%) over the course of the trial. This greater overall restriction in the IFCR-L group, and hence better adherence, is not surprising as these subjects were given portion-controlled liquid meals for breakfast and lunch everyday. Providing such meals has been shown to boost initial weight loss during dietary restriction protocols as it takes the guesswork out of having to estimate calories from varying foods [7]. Although these liquid meals are effective for helping with initial weight loss, lasting weight loss and weight maintenance requires extensive dietary counseling to instill healthy behaviors that can be employed long-term [8,15].",e296d221-0bba-4d49-a7b1-c2bcae00554e
28,discussion3," In view of this, both groups met with a Registered Dietician weekly to incorporate Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) dietary guidelines into their daily lives and to help make the leap from the liquid diet to a wholesome food-based regimen after the study was over.  Beneficial modulations in key lipid risk factors were also observed by both diets. For instance, total and LDL cholesterol decreased in the IFCR-L group (19% and 20%, respectively) and IFCR-F group (8% and 7%, respectively), with greater changes noted for IFCR-L. In contrast, only the IFCR-L group experienced reductions in triglycerides (17% from baseline). The proportion of small LDL particles was also decreased by both the IFCR-L group (week 3: 37 ± 1%, week 10: 28 ± 2%) and IFCR-F group (week 3: 39 ± 1%, week 10: 36 ± 1%). However, increases in LDL peak particle size and the proportion of large LDL particles, were only noted in the IFCR-L group.",fa95f56a-af53-43b6-863f-9514ca114b21
29,discussion4," Taken together, these results suggest that IF combined with CR is an effective means of improving lipid profile in a short-term (8 week) intervention. We also show that adding a liquid diet component may enhance this lipid-lowering effect. The greater decreases in plasma lipids by the IFCR-L diet is most likely due to the greater weight loss noted in this group. For every kg of body weight loss, LDL cholesterol is estimated to decrease by 2 mg/dl [16]. Since the IFCR-L group lost 1.4 kg more body weight than the IFCR-F group, this may explain why the reductions in LDL cholesterol by the liquid diet intervention were more pronounced. The decreases in lipids demonstrated in the present study are similar to what has been reported in previous trials of IF [4,13]. Williams et al. [13] noted a 10% and 52% lowering of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, respectively, after 20 weeks of treatment. In accordance with these findings, Harvie et al.",c2bf2a91-34e3-4939-8028-e969842eb9a3
30,discussion5," [4] observed a 10% decrease in LDL cholesterol and a 17% reduction in triglycerides. No trial to date has examined the effect of IF on LDL particle size, thus there is no data for which to compare our findings.  Modulations in other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk parameters were also more pronounced in the IFCR-L group compared to the IFCR-F group. For instance, fasting plasma glucose and insulin were only decreased by the liquid intervention, suggesting that this diet therapy may benefit glycemic control. Heart rate and homocysteine concentrations were reduced solely in the IFCR-L group. Leptin concentrations, on the other hand, were lowered by both diets. The decreases in leptin are most likely mediated by the reductions in fat mass and visceral fat mass observed in both groups [17]. Leptin may be involved in atherosclerotic plaque formation through its effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in monocytes [18].",61760c9d-19c9-4ab3-89c0-22eea0995b90
31,discussion6," Thus, these reductions in leptin by IFCR may play a systemic anti-atherogenic role [19]. Adiponectin levels were also decreased by both diet interventions. This finding is not surprising, as adiponectin levels have been shown to decrease during the first 8–12 weeks of CR, and then increase only once a 10% weight loss has been achieved [20]. Since the present trial only ran for 8 weeks, and since weight loss was <5%, this may explain why adiponectin concentrations were lowered from baseline. Blood pressure and C reactive protein (CRP) also remained unchanged throughout the course of the trial in both groups. Accumulating evidence suggest that a 5 and 10% reduction in body weight is required to decrease blood pressure and C reactive protein (CRP), respectively [21,22]. This degree of weight loss was not attained, which may explain why these two variables were unaffected by either treatment.",7b1f5a48-8419-4331-9b64-e0932905664a
32,discussion7,"  This study is limited in that it did not tease apart the effect of IF and CR on body weight and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Thus, the independent contributions of the IF diet versus the CR diet on these various parameters, are not known. In order to answer these key questions, a future study should be performed that compares the effect of IF combined with CR, to that of IF alone, and CR alone. An additional limitation of the study was that it did not carefully control for food intake by providing food-based meals to the intervention groups (i.e. dinner meal for the IFCR-L subjects, and 3 meals/d for the IFCR-F subjects). If meals were provided, a more precise measurement of energy restriction and dietary adherence could have been obtained. The study is also limited in that it employed HippoFat software to quantify visceral fat mass from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images.",456219bd-5278-4b7f-ab26-6f70fb6881e8
33,discussion8," This software is limited in that it underestimates visceral fat and overestimates subcutaneous fat, particularly in larger individuals [11]. Another limitation of the study is that we employed food records to estimate overall calorie restriction in each group. It is well known that obese individuals underreport food intake by 20-40% when completing food records [23]. Future studies in this field should therefore implement more robust measures of energy assessment such as the doubly-labeled water technique [24]. The last disadvantage of the study is that only female subjects were employed, and as such, the applicability of these findings to males remains uncertain.  In summary, these findings suggest that IFCR may be effective for reducing body weight, visceral fat mass, and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in obese women. We also report that incorporating liquid meal replacements into an IFCR regimen may facilitate greater weight loss and lipid-lowering.",c3fdcb1e-fa4d-4f31-8b5d-58c23e0150b0
34,discussion9," From a clinical standpoint, we would recommend this diet to individuals who wish to boost the weight loss they see with IF, by adding a daily CR regimen. This combination may also help reduce the boredom typically associated with attempting only one dietary plan. Although these short-term findings are promising, the long-term effects of this novel diet strategy still require confirmation in a large-scale human trial.
