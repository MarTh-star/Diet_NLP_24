Participants  Participants for this dietary intervention study (Clinical Trial Registry: NCT04499599) were recruited via email and web advertisement from July to September 2020 under the protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of WIRB-Copernicus Group (Protocol #20201920). The study was conducted remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic period through phone and video conference calls. The study information was gathered and managed with electronic clinical trial management software (CTMS, ClinicalResearch.io, Boston, MA, USA). All participants gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. Eligibility criteria for the study included age between 18 and 65 years at screening, ability to provide informed consent, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) between 20 and 35, ability to complete assessments in English, e-mail and internet video conference access, in general good health, and willingness to consume all foods served in the protocol.",5b56ed33-bb15-4266-a48b-41b509fad2b3
1,methods1," Exclusion criteria included history of gastric bypass, type 1 diabetes, on medications aimed at keeping blood glucose under control, allergies to study foods, pregnancy and alcohol dependency.  2.2. Study Design  This is a randomized, controlled, parallel-arm study that evaluates the impact of a test formulation, fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar, on ketogenesis and satiety as compared to a 19-h water-only fast. As the study was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic period where conducting conventional university-based clinical trials was not possible, the adoption of virtual technology and methodologies presented a novel approach to assessing formulation’s performance and obtaining user-reported outcomes. The glucose and ketone were measured with a commercial glucose/ketone meter through a finger stick instead of phlebotomy, a breakfast group was included as a control to ensure that the instrument functioned as expected.",ee68ce75-b913-408f-9b47-58a23f51a61b
2,methods2," The breakfast was in the form of a bar for easier preparation and shipping during the pandemic. The breakfast composition (Table 1) was determined based on NHANES (2013–2014) and published data [38]. Due to the typical nutrient composition of a breakfast, we anticipated a rise of glucose level and a decline in ketone level immediately following ingestion. Eligible participants were block-randomized (12 blocks of 9 each) in a 1:1:1 allocation to the breakfast, Fast Bar (fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar) and water-only fast groups using a predetermined randomization table (http://www.randomization.com accessed on 6 June 2020). Study materials, including a digital scale, study foods (Table 1), a Precision Xtra Blood Glucose & Ketone Monitoring System (Abbott) and test supplies as well as instruction materials, were sent to participant’s home.",4af9fd18-11c1-4605-8ec3-f724240f2d46
3,methods3," On the day 1 of the study, subjects in all groups were asked to consume a standardized ready-to-eat dinner meal at 5 pm and, then, fast overnight for approximately 15 h. On day 2, subjects in water-only fast, fasting mimicking diet (FMD), and breakfast groups were asked to continue the water-only fast for 4 more hours, to consume a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar or a breakfast bar, respectively. Blood ketone (BHB) and glucose levels were assessed at baseline and hourly after consuming study foods for 4 h. Subjects were also asked to complete a self-administered online survey (https://www.clinicalresearch.io/), including self-reported height and weight (on study provided scale) as well as information regarding demographics, medical history, concomitant medications, physical activity, drinking habits (all modeled on the Nurses’ Health Study questionnaires).",28663e4a-cdf9-4c17-adbf-b98828e3c931
4,methods4," Besides, participants were asked to answer questions on food quality, satiety, and mood (nervous, blue, annoyed, fatigued, restless, cheerful, relaxed, in control, refreshed, rejuvenated) on a Likert Scale, before and 3 h after consuming the study foods to assessing subjective endpoints related to the study foods. The primary outcomes were 3-h postprandial ketone and glucose levels (day 2) and ketone and glucose Area Under the Curve (Area Under the Curve (AUC)) for the 4-h period following the breakfast (general time frame until the next meal). A non-inferiority test was conducted comparing the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar vs. water fast on the primary outcomes.  2.3.",d067ca4f-749b-4a01-80e3-160f6d2e6b36
5,methods5," Blood Glucose and Ketone  Blood glucose and ketone readings were assessed after 15-h overnight water-only fast (baseline) and hourly after consuming study foods for 4 h using the Precision Xtra Blood Glucose & Ketone Monitoring System (Abbott), a widely used point-of-care kit which had been validated against standard laboratory method in animals and humans [39,40,41,42,43,44].  2.4. Statistical Analysis  Sample size estimation was based on pilot studies assuming ketone (BHB) levels of 0.25 (SD: 0.19) and 0.16 (SD: 0.05) mM for the Fast Bar and the Breakfast groups, respectively. With t test (one-tailed) of difference between two independent means, a total n = 31 will be necessary to achieve 80% power with an α error probability of 0.05 (GPower v3.1.9.6, Franz Faul, University Kiel, Germany). A 10% dropout rate was anticipated based on prior experience in similar dietary intervention studies.",0b08cb04-36c9-441b-b325-66544a0d16dc
6,methods6," Demographic and clinical characteristics were described according to study group using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and counts with frequencies for categorical variables. To examine the impact of the intervention on glucose and BHB at each time point, we used one-way ANOVA with post hoc pairwise comparisons and adjustment for multiple comparisons using Tukey’s method. Non-inferiority was defined based on a power of 80% (β = 0.2), type 1 error (alpha at two-sided 95% confidence intervals) of 0.025, and a non-inferiority margin of 15% for the relative mean difference. Non-inferiority was assessed with a Student’s t-distribution and evaluated whether the means for the 3-h postprandial ketone level on day 2 and area under the curve (Area Under the Curve (AUC)0–4) for BHB within the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar (new treatment method) group was no more than a 15% difference in comparison to the water fast (active comparator) group.",ab0b12f6-c362-4ae3-9352-aaf102211a39
7,methods7," To further evaluate the impact of the intervention on glucose levels over time, a linear mixed effects model was built, including treatment arm and adjusting for age, activity level, body mass index (BMI) category (normal, overweight, obese) and sex. A random effect was specified for the participant. We tested the following interactions with the treatment arm in all models: sex, age, body mass index (BMI) category, and activity level. We subsequently estimated marginal means for each of the variables in the model and tested for significant differences, adjusting for multiple comparisons using Scheffe’s method. Variables were included in the model only if they were statistically significant predictors, confounders, or interactions. A confounder was defined as any variable that altered the relationship between treatment arm and study endpoint by >15%. Model fit was assessed by plotting residuals and evaluating deviation; all models were well-fit. An adjusted p-value < 0.",ea97ffe4-2817-431a-9fc0-a332a17fe255
8,methods8,"05 was considered significant. Analyses were conducting using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).  3. Results  3.1. Baseline Characteristics  Of 110 potential subjects who responded, 1 declined to participate, 3 were deemed ineligible due to missed study appointment, excess body mass index (BMI), and pregnancy, and 1 was disqualified due to SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnosis (Figure 1). At the start of the study, the three groups were similar in age, weight and body mass index (BMI) (Table 2). There were more female participants than male participants (77.1% vs. 22.9%) with the water-only fast group having the most under-represented male participants.  3.2. Blood Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and Glucose Levels  At baseline, no differences were noted in blood glucose and BHB levels between groups (Table 3).",6be6508c-6d79-4537-bb47-e452ebc2b8db
9,methods9," Blood BHB level showed a steady increase in the water-only fast group, whereas the BHB level dipped below the baseline in the breakfast group, recovering 4 h postprandial (Figure 2a). The fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar group showed a steady blood BHB increase 1 h after food consumption and reached the same level of that water-only fast group 3 h post fasting mimicking diet (FMD) consumption (Figure 2b and Table 3). The mean 3-h postprandial ketone levels on day 2 were 0.369 (0.207) mM and 0.374 (0.130) mM for the water fast and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar groups, respectively. The mean difference between the water fast and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar groups was 0.006 (95% CI, −0.089 to 0.077) mM. The difference was above the lower bound 95% CI for the non-inferiority margin (−15%), demonstrating the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar group is non-inferior to the water fast group in terms of ketone levels at hour 3 after consuming food (relative mean difference = 1.35%).",a425dec6-e5b7-4993-821d-aef2e302baae
10,methods10," The water fast group mean was 1.267 (0.529) mM∙h and the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar group mean was 1.172 (0.336) mM∙h for the area under the curve (Area Under the Curve (AUC)0–4) for BHB with a mean difference of −0.094 (95% CI, −0.117 to 0.305) mM∙h (Table 4). The mean difference was above the lower bound 95% CI for the non-inferiority margin (−15%), demonstrating the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar group is non-inferior to the water fast group in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC)0–4 for BHB (relative mean difference = −7.50%).  There was no significant difference in blood glucose levels between the study groups at 3 h after consuming study foods (Table 3). The water fast group mean was 365.0 (50.0) mg/dL∙h and the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar group mean was 363.5 (37.3) mg/dL∙h for the glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC)0–4. The mean difference between the water fast and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar groups was −1.47 (95% CI, −19.55 to 22.50) mg/dL∙h.",1de213c3-09ca-49b4-b800-1834cab50af5
11,methods11," The difference was above the lower bound 95% CI for the non-inferiority margin (−15%), demonstrating the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar group is non-inferior to the water fast group in terms of the area under the curve (Area Under the Curve (AUC)0–4) for glucose (relative mean difference = −0.41%).  Lastly, we modeled Area Under the Curve (AUC)0–4 for both glucose and BHB using linear regression with assessment for confounding and interactions. We found no significant predictors or interactions and we did not find evidence of confounding. Thus, all models are univariate (data now shown).  3.3. Subjective Endpoints  Participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire including 4 questions on satiety, 7 on food quality, and 10 regarding mood. Continued abstinence from food after a 15-h overnight fast led to decreased feeling of fullness and increased desired to eat. fasting mimicking diet (FMD) received similar flavor/quality rating as the breakfast (Figure S1).",e6a2ef8e-45f6-469e-b0f6-43c2b16377a7
12,methods12," fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar significantly imparted fullness and curbed the desire to eat 3 h after the consumption of the study foods compared to water fast (Figure 3). No difference was observed in the mood questionnaire comparing the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar and water fast (Figure S2).  4. Discussion  This study aimed to evaluate how a specially formulated fasting-mimicking nutrition bar affects fasting physiology and subject-reported outcomes following an overnight fast. fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar consumption led to similar levels of 3-h postprandial blood ketone and ketone Area Under the Curve (AUC)0–4 as those of water-only fast. Moreover, postprandial glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC)0–4 of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group was comparable to that of the water fast. The elevation in glucose and the decline in ketone in the breakfast control confirmed that the instrument used to measure ketone and glucose levels functioned as expected.",b4b77994-11c4-4bd7-81df-da93cad332b4
13,methods13," The fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar, despite containing nutrients, did not elicit a 1-h postprandial glucose elevation in contrast to the breakfast. Our results demonstrated that manipulation of energy intake and macronutrient composition can extend physiological ketogenesis similar to water fast while providing some energy and nutrients to increase the sense of fullness and satiety. Another novel aspect of the study was the rapid and simple way the study was conducted remotely during the pandemic to test foods that extend the fasting-associated ketogenesis.  Discoveries linking the nutrient-sensing pathway and aging led to the development of novel fasting-based dietary interventions that downregulate pro-growth signaling, activate cellular protection, and ameliorate risk factors associated with diseases and aging.",5a739fdd-2c30-44e4-a204-203d10745b68
14,methods14," Although intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating patterns gained interest among fasting practitioners in recent years, it could still be challenging to implement due to fatigue, hunger, potential gallstone disease, and other adverse effects [25,30,31,32,33]. To this end, a fasting-mimicking diet was developed that is able to mimic the effects that water-only fasting has on IGF-1, IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), ketone bodies, and glucose [19,36,37,45]. This study further demonstrated that the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar, designed with reduced calories, carbohydrates and protein composition, when consumed after an overnight fast, could extend the physiological ketogenesis of the fast without eliciting a postprandial glucose elevation associated with consuming a typical breakfast.  One major difference between fasting mimicking diet (FMD) technology and a ketogenic diet food (e.g., keto bars) is the percentage of calories derived from carbohydrates and protein.",25ecfc27-9f7e-44eb-936b-f33ae29190b1
15,methods15," Keto based energy bars primarily consist of high fat (60–90% of total energy), moderate protein (10–30% of total energy), and very low carbohydrates (5–10% of total energy) [46], whereas fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar contains lower protein composition and moderate complex carbohydrates (Table 1). Low protein intake had been shown to be more effective in lowering the IGF-1/mTOR nutrient-sensing pathway and is also associated with a reduction in cancer and mortality in the 65 and younger population [47] and protein intake is a key determinant of circulating IGF-1 levels in humans [48]. Furthermore, moderate carbohydrates intake may also spare the gluconeogenesis using amino acids released from muscle protein, thus preserving lean body mass. Administration of as little as 7.5 g carbohydrate to an otherwise starving human halves urinary nitrogen loss [49].",0ab0f1e6-d008-479c-882e-313e83841f8d
16,methods16," It is important to note that the benefits of protein restriction associated with fasting mimicking diet (FMD) were in the context of a short-term fast followed by a refeeding period [19,45], in contrast to a long-term protein restriction resulting from chronic nutrition deprivation.  Time-restricted eating (Time restricted eating (TRE)) refers to the daily practice of consuming food within 6–8 h (i.e., 16:8 or 18:6 Time restricted eating (TRE)). We showed that, despite an initial (1-h postprandial) dip of ketone level in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group, the 4-h ketone and glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC)s were similar to those of water-only fast after a 15-h overnight fast (Figure 1). These results demonstrated that the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar after an overnight fast could keep the body in a physiologic fasting state comparable to 18 to 19-h water fasting.",9679b721-8098-4a71-962a-77b4710681ac
17,methods17," It not only provides nutrients but may improve adherence, in terms of the feeling of satiety (Figure 3), to the time-restricted eating pattern of 16:8 or 18:6. The fasting-mimicking diet technology opens up the possibility of consuming food with certain calories and macronutrient to achieve some of the benefits of a water-only fast while preserving physiologic (i.e., ketogenesis or glucose homeostasis) or molecular mechanisms associated with fasting. Therefore, while the concept of fasting is generally understood as the absence of food intake, an emerging concept such as physiologic or molecular fasting can be further supported with our study.  Limitations  During the COVID-19 pandemic, this trial was carried out remotely in participants’ homes instead of a clinical trial center.",dff8caa4-cb27-4575-98d9-4440785a1a05
18,methods18," Despite this limitation, it is important to note that the design was possible to execute under pandemic conditions, with highly efficient enrolment (106 randomized out of 110 assessed for eligibility) and 99% of randomized subjects (105 out of 106) completing the trial. With no travel to clinical centers necessary and brief and straightforward procedures for subjects to follow, the dropout rate was minimal. Through live video and phone calls and electronic data capture technology, the study staff conducted the informed content, provided glucose/ketone testing instructions, and efficiently guided the participants through the study procedures. This approach can be considered for evaluating other foods in this context.  As having phlebotomy and other clinical tests at home were not practical, the effects of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar on physiological pathways that are influenced or modified by intermittent fasting were not evaluated.",9206cbd1-85cb-4bf0-a35d-35f97d7b731a
19,methods19," Future in-clinic study could evaluate the impact of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar on the nutrient sensing pathways and other important biomarkers associated with extended fasting. Since no postprandial glucose elevation was observed after fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar intake, it will be interesting to see whether postprandial insulin response is also attenuated and how IGF-1 related system would respond [50]. Another limitation of the study is the disproportional large female participation (Table 2). Estrogen, among other hormones, regulates glucose metabolism [51]. Future studies with more balanced sex ratio and detailed information on hormone profile (e.g., menopause and hormone therapy status) could allow a better understanding how age and sex confound the effects of Time restricted eating (TRE).",559e2312-936a-45fd-800d-b627795f167d
20,methods20," Lastly, longitudinal studies incorporating an fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar as part of an intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating program are warranted to evaluate its impact on promoting adherence and added health benefits in light of the potential association between meal skipping and increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events [27,28,29]. Of particular interest is the subjective assessment of satiety and mood. The fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar group had less desire to eat and experienced less reduction in fullness from the baseline than the water-only group. The outcome of the satiety assessment was limited because the evaluation was performed only 3 h after subjects consumed the study foods. The gap period probably should be in line with the consideration that the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar could function as a snack or in place of skipping a meal, thus be tested after a shortened (e.g.",2c843073-872a-4388-b142-4ce0584e4eab
21,methods21,", 1 h) wait period, in addition to the 3-h mark to assess the full impact over a time period [52]. The behavioral implication of this finding should be tested in a longitudinal study with more sensitive and validated instruments, including the ones on mood, in the future. With further study, the consumption of the foods with particular energy content and macronutrient ratios may represent a healthy alternative to skipping breakfast to prolong the intermittent fasting period.  5. Conclusions  Among generally healthy adults, fasting mimicking diet (FMD) bar consumption does not lead to postprandial glucose elevations and extends ketogenesis associated with overnight fasts.",a398dbb5-22c2-4a7a-9768-87f8beea7b66
22,methods22," These results demonstrated that the consumption of foods with a particular energy and macronutrient composition such as a fasting-mimicking diet bar could be a viable strategy to extend the physiological ketogenesis associated with fasting, while providing some nutrients to the body and imparting satiety, to support the practice of time-restricted eating.
