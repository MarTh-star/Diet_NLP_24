Introduction Despite multimodal treatment options including surgical resection [1], radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy [2] as well as tumor treating fields [3], glioblastoma (glioblastoma (GBM)) continues to carry a poor prognosis. Only 15–20% of patients survive longer than three years [4]. A standard second line treatment has not yet been established. According to current guidelines, treatment at recurrence can consist of re-resection, chemotherapy or re-irradiation [5]. With regard to chemotherapy, alkylating substances (re-challenge with either temozolomide or nitrosoureas such as lomustine) are the most commonly used treatment options [6].",e3f62afd-9f02-4688-94f0-fede803b88f3
3,abstract3," Re-irradiation shows low toxicity even for patients with large tumor volumes [7], but median progression free survival (progression free survival (PFS)) is restricted to approximately 5 months [8].  According to Otto Warburg’s theory, malignant cells display high rates of glycolysis and lactate production, even in the presence of adequate oxygen [9,10]. Activated Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) has been shown to stimulate glucose consumption in malignant cells without affecting the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, rendering cancer cells dependent on aerobic glycolysis for continued growth and survival [11]. To a large extend, increased glucose metabolism in glioblastoma (GBM) can be plausibly explained through activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt via epidermal growth factor receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) gene amplifications and mutations as well as loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)) [12].",ef9c9db4-77c7-44e9-9e22-efd2ca0511b3
4,abstract4," Activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in hypoxic and necrotic tumor regions additionally increases aerobic glycolysis [13].  While normal neurons and glial cells can metabolize either ketone bodies (KB; β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and acetone (Ac) formed from acetoacetate by spontaneous decarboxylation) or glucose (Figure 1), it has been suggested that malignant brain tumor cells lack this metabolic flexibility due to a deficiency of enzymes to oxidize ketone bodies [14,15,16,17,18]. KB are formed in the liver via acetyl-CoA predominantly from fatty acids, and blood concentrations increase during fasting or high-fat diets. They can be detected intracerebrally using proton (1H) MR-spectroscopic imaging (MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI)) [19,20,21].  The ketogenic diet (KD) is a well-tolerated, high-fat low-carbohydrate diet that can lower circulating glucose and insulin levels when calorie restricted [22,23].",efe4d4d8-1d01-4e2c-876c-6aa0fa995c94
5,abstract5," If tumor cells indeed lacked the flexibility to produce adenosine triphosphate (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) from ketone body oxidation, KD could result in a selective vulnerability of glioma cells to glucose reduction [24]. In support of this hypothesis, some preclinical studies found that calorie restricted KD (crKD) can reduce tumor growth through effects on angiogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammation and can improve prognosis in high-grade glioma mouse models [25,26,27]. In addition, fasting mimicking diets (fasting mimicking diets (FMD)) and fasting itself showed an increase in resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells of several preclinical cancer models, which could reduce potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments [28,29,30,31].  Another important and energy dependent aspect of tumor metabolism is pH homeostasis.",f5cb69c4-99a8-47e4-9d99-0ecf3c5bc6b2
6,abstract6," Through changes in the expression of cellular membrane ion transport channels and the CO2/HCO3− buffering system, tumor cells maintain an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent reversed pH gradient with a slightly alkaline intracellular pH (pHi) and an acidic extracellular pH (pHe), promoting proliferation, migration and invasion [32,33,34]. adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and pHi values can be measured non-invasively in vitro using phosphorous (31P) MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) [35].

Discussion 3.1. Discussion In our study, Acn was the only reliably MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI)-detectable KB within tumor tissue and/or normal appearing white matter (NAWM). It was only detected in patients during crKD-IF (Group A), not in patients with a balanced diet. But even with elevated ketone serum and urine levels in most patients in Group A, it was merely detected in 4/11 patients.  Reports on MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI)-detectability of KB are not consistent throughout literature and concentrations sometimes fail to show a correlation with serum or urine levels [19,20,38,39]. This may be related to the rather small signal amplitudes of the KB, especially after a short dietary intervention.",acf30930-9089-44d7-94a8-0b803b63c613
15,abstract15," AcAc and β-OHB as hydrophilic anions can merely cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) via a monocarboxylate transporter (monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)), which facilitates proton-linked transport of monocarboxylates [40]. Rat studies have shown an upregulation of cerebral monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 after several weeks of ketogenic diet, but not after short periods of fasting (48 h) [41,42]. Acn on the other hand, is both hydrophilic and lipophilic and can be found in aqueous and lipid compartments [43,44]. Its concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is proportional to plasma, indicating free diffusivity across the BBB [45]. Increased overall tissue concentration combined with the high MR sensitivity of the Acn singlet at 2.22 ppm, which arises from six equivalent protons, may account for MR detection of this specific KB while the others remain invisible.",4834a006-0fc5-404e-8142-00015e1d145f
16,abstract16," The AcAc and βOHB signal originate from three equivalent protons, resulting in half the amplitude for the same molecular concentration compared to Acn. In addition, the 1.2-ppm βOHB signal is a doublet due to J-coupling, so the peak height is further reduced by a factor of 2. Therefore a lower sensitivity of MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) detection has to be assumed for AcAc and βOHB [20].  MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) results showed no significant depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in tumor tissue of patients at day 6 during crKD-IF, even though there were a significant difference in ketone blood levels between Group A and B at day 6, and a decline in fasting glucose in Group A from baseline to day 6. The absence of a cellular energy breakdown suggests that tumor cells maintain glycolysis even with reduced glucose levels and in addition may generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through other sources.",ab82b989-6448-4b53-9eaa-7bfdb41692c5
17,abstract17,"   Recently, the hypothesis that brain tumors are metabolically inflexible has been contradicted in vivo (but not in vitro) in two rat glioma models (9L and RG2) [24,46,47,48]. During infusion of 13C-labled β-OHB, 13C-labeling of glutamate was detected in vivo in tumor voxels using 13C/1H MR Spectroscopy. Glutamate was labeled through fast exchange with α-ketoglutarate, which is an intermediate metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and can derive from oxidative metabolism of β-OHB. Contribution of ketone bodies to oxidative metabolism increased when animals were fed a KD with upregulation of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 in RG2 tumor cells. Histological staining confirmed that tumor cells made up the vast majority of the tissue, demonstrating enzyme capacity of tumor cells to oxidize KB, generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP).",6d146409-a701-4101-94ad-f0a93c1a4014
18,abstract18,"   Acidification of the extracellular milieu (low pHe) and concomitant intracellular alkalization of the cytoplasm (high pHi) are hallmarks of cancer, leading to a reverse pH gradient in cancer cells [49,50]. A rapid increase in intracellular lactate concentration in glycolytic tumors is concomitant with a sharp decrease in pH that starts to relax rapidly towards more alkaline values [51]. Intracellular alkalosis is maintained through several mechanisms including the increased expression and activity of acid extruding plasma membrane transporters, for example, Na+/H+ exchangers (Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE)), H+/K+-adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ases, and Na+/HCO3− cotransporters (Na+/HCO3− cotransporters (NBC)), which work in concert with carbonic anhydrases (CA) [52]. Since a shift from glycolysis towards oxidative phosphorylation is expected during KD/fasting, less intracellular lactate will be generated in the fasting state.",cab63e6b-db3e-4d4c-bdd9-58c2a7ace04e
19,abstract19," In our study, stable adenosine triphosphate (ATP) values between baseline and day 6 in Group A were corroborated not only by maintenance, but even a slight increase in alkaline pHi in tumor voxels. Our findings might be the momentary result of an overshoot due to the joint activity of lactate and H+ co-transporting monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4. However, this hypothesis needs to be experimentally confirmed by further studies. Ultimately, low intracellular H+ concentrations will favor lactate flux into the cell [52]. The direct influence of ketone bodies on pHi appears less likely. Voronina et al. exposed synaptosomes to high levels of β-OHB and saw no changes in intracellular pH [53]. As opposed to glucose utilization, utilization of ketone bodies does not result in lactate production. Experiments with glioblastoma cell culture further showed that lactate excretion is stable even when β-OHB is available as an additional source of energy [15].",c0fbdf03-6fc0-4b40-aa9f-efc5d5129459
20,abstract20," Consistent with these findings, we recently reported that isocitrate dehydrogenase (isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)) mutant tumors, which are less glycolytic, display significantly lower lactate concentrations compared with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type tumors and a near-normal pHi [54]. Ultimately in the complex process of cancer metabolism, other factors may come into play—for example a different link of glucose and β-OHB metabolism to redox potential via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)) utilization.  3.2. Limitations Due to missing values of patients withdrawing from study or MRS consent, the number of cases available for analysis is reduced and therefore the statistical power.   In accordance with prior studies, a carefully simulated and constructed LCModel basis set for the specific acquisition and quantitative criteria of KB is necessary.",47bdc412-9fbd-485e-b133-b79064aa32d4
21,abstract21," Increased numbers of signal averages with consecutively increased scan time, larger voxels and employment of a semi localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (semi-LASER) sequence may allow improved detection of KB [20]. However, when the protocol for this study was set up in 2013, a semi-LASER sequence was not implemented at our center.  Phantom replacement as an external reference method for metabolite quantitation is affected by several factors that can create variability between measurements in phantom and human subjects such as coil loading, transmit calibration, and receive profile. While the Tofts formula, which was applied in this study, takes some factors such as coil loading into account, others such as the inhomogeneous B1 field obtained at 3 T are not corrected for. Quantitative estimates of metabolite concentrations in patients therefore may differ from their true concentrations.",2c7e5e7e-d4b7-49fd-a985-73f8c549a869
22,abstract22," The study protocol did not include the acquisition of water spectra for an internal reference method in addition or as a comparison to the external method.  Unfavorably, 31P MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has a poor spatial resolution (large voxel sizes) when compared to 1H MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and an increased spreading of signal into adjacent voxels caused by the point spread function (point spread function (PSF)). The point spread function (PSF) describes the blurring of a point due to coarse k-space sampling. This holds especially true for 8 × 8 × 8 k-space sampling, which is typical for many 31P MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) studies and was employed in this study. The inherent partial volume effect tends to level focal changes in the position of the signal of inorganic phosphate.

At physiological pH, H2PO4 and HPO4 ions contribute to the Pi signal.",1a76a30c-1b5f-4302-8ea8-898c9358aeb7
31,methods8," Since both components have different chemical shift, the chemical shift (signal position) of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is pH dependent and can be used as a pH-marker [55]. Referring to the approach of Petroff et al. [64] (i.e., calculating pH according to pH = pkA + 10log (δ1 − δ0/δ0 − δ2)), the pH values of the predefined areas of interest were determined from the chemical shift difference between Pi and PCr. The formula is implemented in jMRUI with the following default values: pkA 6.75 ppm, delta1 3.27 ppm, delta2 5.63 ppm. Fitting the 31P spectra, all signals were generally assigned correctly as visually assessed, leaving a flat line for the residual with equal distribution of noise.",bff47c39-9c77-4446-a960-899b8f40d935
32,methods9," Changes in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations were monitored using the intensity of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ß signal, normalized to the intensity of the other phosphate containing metabolites (adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ß/(PEth + glyceroethanolamine (GPE) + glycerophosphocholine (GPC) + PCre + adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ß)). Each metabolite symbol represents its intensity as given by jMRUI a non linear least square fitting algorithm (AMARES). The normalization corrects for variations in coil sensitivity due to different coil loadings, while still being sensitive to changes in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations.  4.5. Simulation of Basis Set for 1H MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) The basis set for LCModel was simulated using the NMRScope-B plugin, which is implemented in jMRUI (Version 6.0 beta) [65].",0fb146ef-6c32-4168-8265-54ac2e2b456f
33,methods10," MR spectra for each metabolite were calculated based on a priori knowledge of scalar coupling, chemical shifts, and vendor specific hardware parameters for data acquisition. The metabolites simulated and included in the data evaluation were: sodium-3-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), acetone natural (Acn), lithium acetoacetate (AcAc), sodium l-lactate (Lac), N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (N acetyl l aspartic acid (NAA)), creatine anhydrous (Cr), choline chloride (Cho), l-glutamine (Gln), l-glutamic acid (Glu), and myo-inositol (mI) (all Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). A line broadening of 3 Hz was applied to each basis spectrum.  Following simulation, the basis set was tested on phantom data, including signals for the respective metabolites at expected in vivo concentrations (Lac 2 mmol/L, N acetyl l aspartic acid (NAA) 8 mmol/L, Cr 6 mmol/L, Cho 2 mmol/L, Gln 2 mmol/L, Glu 7 mmol/L, mI 4 mmol/L). Concentrations of βOHB, Acn and AcAc were at 1 mM.",daf944b3-b9d1-425b-9c93-85334bc33788
34,methods11," The frequency, phases and linewidths of the peaks were all constrained relative to the creatine singlet at 3.03 ppm (Figure 3a).  4.6. Phantom Replacement A spherical phantom was prepared containing 2600 mL of an aqueous solution (Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline, DPBS) and the respective metabolites at physiological pH (pH adjusted to 6.96 by titration with NaOH). The spherical size was chosen to minimize susceptibility artifacts. The phantom was placed in the center of the dual tuned head coil. Measurements lead to well-resolved spectra with flat baselines. Using the phantom replacement technique as described by Tofts et al. and applied by our group before, metabolite levels for Acn were calculated [66,67]. Data were acquired with a transmit/receive coil. Regarding the principle-of-reprocity we applied corrections as described by Michaelis et al., which are also included in the Tofts formula [68].",b6fab8b2-0870-49a0-81f5-94573d845565
35,methods12," Relaxation effects for Acn signals at 3T (signal loss) were corrected assuming previously published values for N acetyl l aspartic acid (NAA) for T2 and T1 (T2 = 270 ms; T1 = 1.4 s, correction factor 0.59) [69,70].  4.7. Laboratory Testing Patient urine samples were analyzed using Combur® 10 Test Strips (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), while capillary blood samples were analyzed using the Precision Xceed system with blood β-ketone test strips (Abott, Chicago, IL, USA). Combur® Test Strips detect AcAc (detection limit approximately 0.5 mmol/L) and Acn (detection limit approximately 7 mmol/L), while blood test strips detect βOHB (detection limit < 1 mmol/L).  4.8. Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using a commercially available software (STATISTICA, version 7.1; StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA).",3542ca47-8aaf-4093-8d8f-a9643b82640f
36,methods13," A Wilcoxon signed-rank test as a paired, non-parametric statistical hypothesis test was used to compare pHi and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels at baseline and on day 6 (equal to the third day of fasting after three days of crKD) within tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). The same test was used to compare pHi and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels within tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) at each point of time. An unpaired t-test was used to compare blood ketone levels of Group A and B and a paired t-test to compare glucose levels at baseline and on day 6 for each group. For all tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength of a linear association between MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) detected KB and KB in urine and blood samples.  5.",782015c0-f8be-44dd-8396-40cad33e3526
37,methods14," Conclusions MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allowed specific detection of ketosis in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) during crKD-IF, but sensitivity was low. The intervention did not affect tumor adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels or pHi the way, that would reflect a selective vulnerability of tumor cells to glucose starvation. According to our findings, tumor cells maintain energy homeostasis even with reduced glucose levels through either enhanced uptake of glucose or generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through other sources, possibly even KB oxidation. Findings of the subtrial are in line with the negative results of the main trial [37] with regard to progression free and overall survival (progression free survival (PFS) und OS) and suggest that metabolic interventions targeting brain tumor metabolism need to be further refined.
