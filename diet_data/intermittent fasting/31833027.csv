0,methods0,"4.1. Experimental Animals Male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) at six months of age (body weight, 75 ± 5 g) were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center (Kangwon University, Chuncheon, Gangwon, Republic of Korea). They had been maintained at a constant temperature (23 ± 2 °C) and humidity (50 ± 5%) with a 12 h light/dark cycle. The care and handling of animals in this research complied with the “Guidelines of the Current International Laws and Policies” described in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (The National Academies Press, 8th Ed., 2011). In addition, the protocol of this experiment was approved (approval number: KW-200113-1) by the committee of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kangwon National University.  4.2.",4807f971-b2f1-44d3-b62c-e5a6fc5c5fb7
1,methods1," IF and Experimental Groups For IF, gerbils were allowed free access to ND every other day and no food on alternate days (24 h fasting and 24 h feeding), and IF was applied for three months according to the published method [3,32,55]. During the feeding period, food intake in all gerbils was controlled daily (10 g/day), and body weight was monitored every week.  For experimental groups, 96 male gerbils were used and randomly divided into four groups, as follows: (1) ND/sham group (n = 12)—gerbils were fed ND and received sham ischemia operation; (2) ND/ischemia group (n = 36)—animals were fed ND and received ischemia; (3) IF/sham group (n = 12)—gerbils had IF for three months and received sham operation; (4) IF/ischemia group (n = 36)—animals had IF and received ischemia. The animals in the ischemia group were sacrificed at 1 day, 2 days, and 5 days after ischemia to investigate the effects of IF on CB expression and neuroprotection following transient global forebrain ischemia.",e75d7ba5-8790-4e17-a4cc-4626c61de970
2,methods2," To decrease the number of gerbils, gerbils in the sham group were sacrificed only at 5 days after the sham ischemia operation.  4.3. Induction of Transient Forebrain Ischemia As we previously described [5], all gerbils were anesthetized with a mixture of 2.5% isoflurane from Baxtor (Deerfield, IL, USA) in 67% nitrous oxide and 33% oxygen. Under anesthesia, the gerbils received an incision on the neck to find both common carotid arteries, and the arteries were occluded by non-traumatic aneurysm clips for 5 min and then re-perfused. The body temperature of the gerbils was controlled at normothermia (37 ± 0.5 °C) using a thermometric blanket during the surgery, monitoring the temperature using a rectal temperature probe (TR-100) (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, USA). All animals were fed ND after the surgical procedure. The gerbils included in the sham group underwent identical surgical procedures without the ligation of common carotid arteries.",e30fb152-bcf3-47b5-b423-c48576ce3c5e
3,methods3," Thereafter, the gerbils were kept in thermal incubators (temperature, 23 °C; humidity, 60%) to maintain body temperature at the normothermic level until they were euthanized. Until the gerbils were sacrificed, they were continually fed ND or IF.  4.4. Passive Avoidance Test (PAT) Learning and memory was assayed through Passive Avoidance Test (PAT) according to the modification of a published method [56]. Shortly, the Gemini Avoidance System (GEM 392) (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for this Passive Avoidance Test (PAT), which consisted of two rooms (light and dark) with a grid floor. First, training was performed one day before IF, 29 days after IF and 4 days after ischemia, as follows. For the training, each gerbil was allowed to explore the environment of the two rooms for one min, while the grid floor was opened.",5a10d815-2c50-404f-82cb-f7fd5f6427f8
4,methods4," After the exploration, the gerbil was permitted to enter the dark room when a light in the light room was turned on, while the floor was given an inescapable foot-shock (0.5 mA for 5 s). A substantive Passive Avoidance Test (PAT) test was done 24 h after the training. Each trained gerbil was put in the dark room, the light of the light room was turned on, and the floor was opened. Thereafter, we recorded the latency time, which is the time to enter the dark room, within 180 s.  4.5. Western Blotting To examine changes of CB protein level in the hippocampal CA1, 40 gerbils (n = 5 at sham, 1, 2 and 5 days post-ischemia in each group) were used for the blotting according to a previously published method [57]. Shortly, at each point in time, five gerbils in each group were deeply anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg) from JW Pharm (Seoul, South Korea), and their hippocampal CA1 tissues were collected.",67bd23da-2c91-4553-9d39-13c2b48fe0c6
5,methods5," The tissues were lysed with RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and homogenized with an ultrasonic homogenizer for 5 min. These homogenates were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Next, protein concentrations were measured with a bicinchoninic acid kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). In detail, the proteins were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Corp., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). These membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk (in Tris-buffered saline/Tween, TBST) for 60 min on a shaker at room temperature and then incubated in primary antibodies (rabbit anti-CB) (diluted 1:1000) (Cell signaling technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and rabbit anti-β-actin (42 kDa) (1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) overnight at 4 °C.",47403bba-8353-40a9-9d13-d962b5b0aab9
6,methods6," The membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing them with TBST, they were visualized by horseradish peroxidase (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The band intensities were analyzed using ImageJ (ver. 1.52v, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).  4.6. Preparation of Histological Sections At each point in time after transient forebrain ischemia (TFI), seven gerbils in each group were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg of pentobarbital sodium (JW Pharm. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) at designated times (1, 2 and 5 days after ischemia) following IF. Under anesthesia, the gerbils were transcardially washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) (pH 7.4) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution (in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4).",647be053-9cbc-42be-96ba-c934f6f1b534
7,methods7," After fixation, their brains were removed, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution. Finally, brain tissues containing the hippocampus were serially sectioned into coronal sections (30 μm thickness) in a cryostat of Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) and kept in plates containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS).  4.7. Immunohistochemistry We used the following antibodies: rabbit anti-CB (diluted 1:1000; Cell signaling technology, Danvers, MA, USA), NeuN (diluted 1:800; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), Iba-1 (1:800, Wako, Japan) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:1000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). For immunohistochemistry for each antibody, we carried it out according to our published method [38]. Shortly, the sections obtained at designated times after ischemia were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution for 30 min, followed by 10% normal goat serum solution (in 0.05 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4) for 30 min.",ecd90535-4ee1-4fa4-9ff3-e433f7399495
8,methods8," These sections were reacted with each antibody for 18 h at 4 °C. Continuously, they were exposed to biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:200, Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) and streptavidin peroxidase complex (diluted 1:200, Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature, respectively. Finally, the reacted sections were visualized by incubating in a 0.05% solution of 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)) (in 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer, pH 7.2).  4.8. CV Histochemistry CV histochemical staining was performed to examine the distribution and morphology of cells in the hippocampus. In short, according to a published method [58], 1% CV acetate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (in distilled water) was prepared, and glacial acetic acid was added to this solution. To stain the sections, they were reacted in the CV solution for 1 h at room temperature (about 23 °C).",04a115e1-76fc-45dc-80a7-0fe8aa59b961
9,methods9," After washing the sections with distilled water, they were dehydrated with serial ethanol. Finally, the stained sections were prepared as permeant slides.  4.9. Fluoro Jade B (FJB) Histofluorescence Staining Fluoro Jade B (FJB) is a fluorescent derivative used to detect degenerating cells. In this study, Fluoro Jade B (FJB) histofluorescence staining was done to examine the damage/death of hippocampal cells after ischemia. As described previously [55,59,60], in short, the sections were immersed in a 0.06% solution of potassium permanganate and reacted with 0.0004% solution of Fluoro Jade B (FJB) (Histochem, Jefferson, AR, USA).  4.10. Data Analysis Changes in CB, Iba-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity were quantitatively analyzed according to our published method [38]. In brief, we selected seven sections at 120 μm intervals within the antero-posterior from −1.4 to −2.2 mm according to the gerbil brain atlas in each gerbil.",c7785f68-f783-437c-9b42-de7e9a899839
10,methods10," Images of each immunoreactivity were taken from the corresponding area (250 µm2) under 20× primary magnification in the hippocampus with an AxioM1 light microscope from Carl Zeiss (Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a digital camera from Axiocam (Carl Zeiss, Germany), which was connected to a PC monitor. The captured images were calibrated into an array of 512 × 512 pixels, and each immunoreactivity was evaluated by optical density (OD). The OD was obtained after the transformation of the mean grey level using a formula (OD = log (256/mean grey level). The background density was subtracted, and the OD ratio was calibrated as the percent of relative OD (relative optical density (ROD)) using Adobe Photoshop version 8.0. Finally, relative optical density (ROD) was analyzed with the Image J 1.46 software from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA).  Numbers of NeuN-and Fluoro Jade B (FJB)-positive cells were counted according to our published method [61].",0f6cc9f5-9e8e-493a-95b7-5c25816a6e85
11,methods11," In brief, we selected seven sections via the above-mentioned method. Images of NeuN-positive cells were captured with an AxioM1 light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Images of Fluoro Jade B (FJB)-positive cells were taken with an epifluorescent microscope from Carl Zeiss (Göttingen, Germany) equipped with 450–490 nm of blue excitation light and a barrier filter. The digital images of cells positive for NeuN and Fluoro Jade B (FJB) were counted in a 250 × 250 μm square applied at the center of the CA1 region using an image analyzing software (Optimas 6.5) from CyberMetrics (Scottsdale, AZ, USA).  4.11. Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as the mean±SEM (standard error of the mean).",ff36a014-f935-4a62-ba46-3826f366796c
12,methods12," The differences in the relative optical density (ROD) or mean numbers of the respective immunoreactive structures obtained for each group were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Tukey’s test using GraphPad Instat from Instat Statistics (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. ",7fab56f7-6cb9-4c55-a4d7-71befc28c17a
