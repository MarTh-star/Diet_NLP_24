0,introduction0,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly and characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment. AD comprises early-onset AD (familial AD) which affects a minority of AD patients and late-onset AD (sporadic AD) which afflicts over 95% of patients with AD (Bruni et al., 2014; Guerreiro and Hardy, 2014). Excessive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in brain is found in both early-onset AD and late-onset AD, which has been assumed to result from an imbalance between its production and clearance . Increasing evidence has supported that Aβ production and clearance are impaired in early-onset AD, whereas individuals with late-onset AD exhibit impaired Aβ clearance only . Therefore, Aβ clearance has been considered to be crucial in the development of AD, and targets enhancing Aβ clearance may be alternative strategies for AD treatment.",0f611243-db64-4deb-8910-84a3c9083d4f
1,introduction1,"  So far, several mechanisms have been identified as being involved in clearing Aβ from the brain, including enzymatic degradation, cellular uptake, transport across the blood–brain barrier and blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, interstitial fluid bulk flow, and cerebrospinal fluid absorption into the circulatory and lymphatic systems (Tarasoff-Conway et al., 2015). Animal studies found that about 75% of extracellular Aβ is cleared by the blood–brain barrier, with only about 10% being cleared by interstitial fluid bulk flow (Shibata et al., 2000; Zlokovic and Frangione, 2003). However, recent studies have indicated that interstitial fluid bulk flow contributes to a larger portion of extracellular Aβ clearance than previously thought . Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-dependent glymphatic (glial + lymphatic) pathway has been demonstrated to play an important role in driving the removal of soluble Aβ from the interstitium (Rodriguez et al.",ce5bc69e-7391-47af-89f1-656410a96a6d
2,introduction2,", 2006; Iliff and Nedergaard, 2013). AQP4 is the most highly expressed aquaporin in the mammalian brain, with the polarized distribution in the perivascular endfeet of astrocytes . More importantly, Aβ clearance was reduced by 55–65% in AQP4 knockout mice . In AD, although the alteration of AQP4 expression in the brain remains controversial, several lines of evidence has shown that AQP4 mislocalization performs a crucial role in the reduction of Aβ clearance .  AQP4 is expressed as two major principal isoforms: a long isoform with translation initiation at Met-1 (AQP4-M1) and a short isoform with translation initiation at Met-23 (AQP4-M23), forming heterotetramers in the plasma membrane. AQP4 tetramers further aggregate into supra-molecular structures named orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) .",9548d142-55d9-49ff-a8df-e4c313458056
3,introduction3," Papadopoulos and Verkman (2013) found that AQP4-M23 is enriched in the core of OAPs, and AQP4-M1 in the periphery. In addition, increased proportion of AQP4-M1/M23 in oocytes led to disorganize OAPs . It has been documented that OAPs plays a role in the AQP4 polarity to astrocyte endfeet . Furthermore, AQP4-M1/M23 ratio was found to be elevated with the increase of total AQP4 protein expression after hypoglycemia which may cause disorganization of the OAPs and loss of AQP4 polarity . However, it is still not clear whether the ratio of AQP4-M1/M23 expression is increased in AD.  Some studies have identified microRNA recognition sites in gene promoters proximal to known transcription initiation sites and implicated microRNAs can regulate the transcription of the target gene (Kim et al., 2008; Younger and Corey, 2011).",bfba2a49-831a-48bb-8070-d6bd304e52cd
4,introduction4," The transcriptional activity of AQP4-M1 was found to be repressed by microRNA-130a (miR-130a), which may result in the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio, in Astrocytoma (CRL1718) and HeLa (CCL2) cells . As we know, the expression of microRNAs can be regulated by histone acetylation. Meanwhile, the level of histone acetylation is significantly reduced in the brain of AD . Histone acetylation is regulated by histone acetyltransferase (histone acetyltransferase (HAT)) and histone deacetylase (histone deacetylase (HDAC)). Accumulating evidence has revealed that histone deacetylase (HDAC)s may be potential therapeutical targets for the treatment of AD , especially regarding the involvement of histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 in the molecular mechanisms of AD (Bardai and D’Mello, 2011; McQuown et al., 2011).",2fb149f8-3649-451e-8fd4-9ad6320ab3d3
5,introduction5," Interestingly, a study in ankylosing spondylitis found that histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 formed negative feedback loop with miR-130a in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Jiang and Wang, 2016). Nevertheless, it is not clarified whether inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 regulates the expression of miR-130a and the ratio of AQP4-M1/M23 in AD.  Some researchers have recognized the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting (IF) against AD . What is more, IF results in ketone body metabolism and an increase in β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB; a major component of ketone bodies) level in blood (Robinson and Williamson, 1980; Wang et al., 2017). βOHB has been reported to traverse the blood–brain barrier and significantly inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 expression as an endogenous pan histone deacetylase (HDAC)s inhibitor . Emerging evidence has shown that βOHB exerts a protective effect against AD (Tarasoff-Conway et al.",739bc641-cc03-44b0-bfa2-db6ce112efc0
6,introduction6,", 2015; Xie et al., 2015). Therefore, it is needed to demonstrate whether βOHB plays a key role in the effects of IF against AD, which may be associated with the inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC)3.  In the present study, we confirmed the beneficial effects of IF in AD, and the mechanism may be associated with recovery of AQP4 polarity, resulting from the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio. Furthermore, βOHB may at least partly mediate the effect of IF on the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in AD, in which miR-130a and histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 are possibly implicated.

36,discussion0,"The pathogenesis of AD is complex, involving multiple mechanisms, which causes considerable difficulty in developing an effective treatment. Pharmacologic therapies approved for AD currently are mainly several acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine). However, these drugs focus on delaying or arresting disease progression rather than reversing disease. The importance of IF in general in forestalling the onset of certain neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, has been documented in numerous studies . Results from Morris water maze in this study showed that the impairment of spatial memory was ameliorated by alternate day fasting (ADF) in APP/PS1 mice. alternate day fasting (ADF) was also found to play a role in protecting against the increase of Aβ deposition in the brains of APP/PS1 mice.",2f4407de-e2c2-4e78-8f86-c808ee4f09a4
37,discussion1," As is well-known, alternate day fasting (ADF) results in an increase in the serum level of the ketone body (Robinson and Williamson, 1980; Wang et al., 2017). The increased ketone body by fasting or ketogenic diet is remarkably effective in managing intractable seizures in children. Moreover, βOHB accounts for about 70% of ketone body. Accumulation of βOHB in blood increases to 1–2 mM during fasting when the liver switches to fatty acid oxidation . In our preliminary experiments, we found the level of βOHB in blood was increased after fasting 12 h in C57BL/6 mice. Notably, βOHB has been reported to take effect in delaying AD progression in several studies . It is suggested that βOHB may play a crucial role in protective function of alternate day fasting (ADF) against AD.",cb580c08-5c93-4500-8fc3-f10f8885235f
38,discussion2,"  Progressive accumulation and aggregation of Aβ in the brain are thought to be a net result of imbalance between their production and clearance ; indeed, Aβ clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD . AQP4 has been indicated to be closely related with Aβ clearance . In some studies, no differences were found in the expression of AQP4 in the frontal cortex between AD patients and controls , while one study reported that the expression of AQP4 was significantly decreased in stage IV–V AD patients with moderate or severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy . However, the present study showed a significant increase in the expression of AQP4 in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, which is in accordance with some human and animal studies .",43ae66cf-702e-4068-a1b8-fd55a3a91216
39,discussion3,"The above inconsistent results in AQP4 expression in AD may be associated with the different stages of disease, specific neuroanatomical areas, and whether patients had complications or not. In addition, several animal models of AD studies have shown a redistribution of astrocytic AQP4 from endfeet membranes to non-endfeet ones, resulting in a loss of AQP4 polarity . Immunofluorescence results from this study also demonstrated that AQP4 localization was severely perturbed, exhibiting a loss of polarity to the endfeet and increased somal labeling. It is indicated that although the expression of AQP4 was increased in APP/PS1 mice, the role of AQP4 in Aβ clearance failed to play due to the loss of AQP4 polarity. Furthermore, Deng et al. (2014) found that the ratio of AQP4-M1/M23 was increased in the brain after hypoglycemia which may result in the loss of AQP4 polarity.",ebcd1a72-449e-4c6a-8e72-8a9c1b027a46

Meanwhile, this study showed that alternate day fasting (ADF) alleviated the loss of AQP4 polarity, up-regulation of AQP4-M1 expression, and increase of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in APP/PS1 mice. It is possible that alternate day fasting (ADF) inhibited the increase of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in AD through down-regulating the expression of AQP4-M1, accordingly recovered AQP4 polarity. However, further study is needed to explore whether other pathways exist to affect AQP4 polarity in AD by alternate day fasting (ADF).",07e08a49-d254-45f8-adef-2035eac1970e
41,discussion5," Insulin-degrading enzyme (Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE)) is involved in Aβ clearance and associated with the ketone body, thus it is also necessary to determine whether alternate day fasting (ADF) reduces Aβ deposition through regulating Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) or other enzymes involved in the degradation of Aβ. Other mechanisms on Aβ clearance are equally worth studying in the effect of alternate day fasting (ADF) on AD.  The results from in vitro study indicated that the expression of AQP4 was increased with exposure to low concentrations of Aβ (2 μM) and decreased with exposure to high concentrations of Aβ (10 μM) in U251 cells, which is consistent with the results of Yang et al. (2012) studies. Low concentration of Aβ possible promotes astrocyte activation, causing the up-regulation of AQP4 as a compensatory response, while high concentration of Aβ likely results in astrocyte dysfunction and lowering the expression of AQP4.",1d6d8e0c-2064-4334-a896-b0b82de10a4b
42,discussion6," In this study, the expression of AQP4 was shown to be increased in APP/PS1 mice, which is in agreement with results of low concentration of Aβ in vitro. Further study is needed to explore whether the expression of AQP4 is decreased in AD mice at an older age with an increase in Aβ. More importantly, we found that AQP4-M1/M23 ratio was increased in U251 cells treated with Aβ at both low and high concentration, suggesting that the change of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio may play a more vital role in AD. Furthermore, βOHB was found to alleviate the increase of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in Aβ-exposed U251 cells. Also, the effect of βOHB on AQP4-M1 was in accordance with that of alternate day fasting (ADF). Unlike alternate day fasting (ADF), βOHB was found to increase the expression of AQP4-M23.

43,discussion7," In a word, βOHB may at least partly mediate the effect of alternate day fasting (ADF) on the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in AD.  MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs capable of regulating gene expression. Although microRNAs are known to mediate translational silencing in the cytoplasm, recent evidence has suggested that some microRNAs may also regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level (Kim et al., 2008; Younger and Corey, 2011). miR-130a has been reported to repress transcriptional activity of AQP4-M1 but not AQP4-M23 in the study of cerebral ischemia . In the current study, decreased miR-130a levels were found in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice and in Aβ-exposed U251 cells, which were alleviated by alternate day fasting (ADF) and βOHB, respectively. Further research, using miR-130a mimic, showed a decrease in the expression of AQP4-M1 instead of AQP4-M23 mRNA in vitro.",fe00e017-ce26-473b-a4de-46ba8055bf75
44,discussion8," However, the expression of both AQP4-M1 and AQP4-M23 proteins was decreased in cells treated with mimic, what is more, the ratio of AQP4-M1/M23 was decreased. Additionally, the opposite effects on the regulation of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio were obtained by using miR-130a inhibitor and miR-130a mimic. In rat astrocytes primary cultures, a large proportion of AQP4-M23 protein has been reported to derive from AQP4-M1 mRNA translation, which could explain the inconsistent of alteration in AQP4-M23 mRNA and protein expression in cells treated by miR-130a mimic or miR-130a inhibitor. Furthermore, there was a big discrepancy between the effect of mimic-miR-130a on the expression of AQP4-M1 mRNA and protein, suggesting that this mimic-miR-130a possibly influenced translation of the AQP4-M1 mRNA, rather than only transcription of the AQP4-M1 DNA coding sequence.",59d4c5bc-b08c-486f-9904-481d71b60e58
45,discussion9," In this study, the effect of miR-130a mimic on AQP4-M1 was in accordance with that of βOHB, but the opposite effects were found in the alteration of AQP4-M23 expression in cells treated with mimic and βOHB. It is indicated that miR-130a partly mediated the effect of βOHB on the AQP4-M1/M23 ratio, in which other ways may be involved.  histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 knockdown or histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 inhibition promoted the expression of miRNA-130a, and histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 was recruited to the promoter region of the gene encoding miR-130a in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Jiang and Wang, 2016). In this study, alternate day fasting (ADF) and βOHB were found to alleviate the increase of histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 expression in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice and in Aβ-exposed U251 cells, respectively.",4d5adb5d-66c4-4e72-b5c2-04a5bfd15ac3
46,discussion10," Also, the expression of miR-130a was elevated in histone deacetylase (HDAC)3-silenced or histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 inhibitor-treated U251 cells, suggesting that βOHB increased the expression of miR-130a via inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 expression, at least in part. Unexpectedly, silencing of histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 gene expression caused up-regulation of AQP4-M1 and AQP4-M23 in different degrees, suggesting that histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 may regulate AQP4 gene expression by completely different mechanisms independently of miR-130a. Therefore, further study is needed to reveal the mechanism concerning the regulation of AQP4 expression by histone deacetylase (HDAC)3. Most importantly, AQP4-M1/M23 ratio was significantly decreased in histone deacetylase (HDAC)3-silenced cells. Possibly, the repression of AQP4-M1 expression by miR-130a contributed to the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio.",04c9628e-d785-4e7d-9c36-cb0386483599
47,discussion11," In addition, the effect of silencing histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 on AQP4-M23 but not AQP4-M1 is in consistent with that of βOHB, suggesting the effect of βOHB on AQP4-M23 may be partly mediated by histone deacetylase (HDAC)3. Briefly, histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 may be involved in the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio induced by βOHB, and in which miR-130a may be implicated. Further study is necessary to investigate whether other βOHB-modulated histone deacetylase (HDAC) subtypes are involved in the regulation of AQP4 in AD.  Conclusion In the present study, alternate day fasting (ADF) was demonstrated to improve cognitive function and provide protection against Aβ deposition in APP/PS1 mice. The potential anti-Aβ mechanism of alternate day fasting (ADF) may be associated with alleviating the loss of AQP4 polarity by inhibiting the up-regulation of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio.",533fa433-ec6e-458c-a076-3873cb0c9cde
48,discussion12," In addition, βOHB may partly mediate the effect of alternate day fasting (ADF) on the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in AD, in which the regulation of βOHB on miR-130a and histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 may be implicated as a potential mechanism. Due to the limited sample, the brain Aβ levels were detected only by immunohistochemistry in this study, which should be confirmed by more quantitative assays, i.e., ELISA. In this study, no effects of alternate day fasting (ADF) on WT mice were found, of which the mechanism needs to be studied in the future. In our daily life, IF is easy to implement, which may be utilized as a potential candidate for AD prevention. However, it should be prudent to extrapolate the conclusions from experimental AD models to humans.
