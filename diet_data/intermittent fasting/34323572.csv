0,methods0," A retrospective chart review of a single surgeon’s clinic records was performed to identify patients who maintained nutritional ketosis for at least four months between January 2015 and October 2020.   Patient selection  A single surgeon’s clinic record for patients who received a diagnosis of glioma was analyzed, and patients were screened for age greater than 18 years from January 2015 to October 2020. Institutional review board approval for this study was obtained through the Barrow Neurological Clinical Outcomes Database. The St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center Institutional Review Board confirmed that no additional ethical approval was required for this retrospective observational study. Given the retrospective nature of this small patient series and the lack of disclosing patient health information, the project did not meet the definition of human subject research; therefore, retrospective patient informed consent for study analysis was not pursued.",8f5fd916-a30d-403e-becb-8cf923f276f3
1,methods1,"  All patients who received a diagnosis of glioma during the time interval above were presented with the option of Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT). Patients who did not have clinical documentation of reported adherence to nutritional ketosis (e.g., by blood serum ketometer readings) indicating that nutritional ketosis was maintained for at least four months during the postdiagnosis surveillance interval were excluded. The documentation had to indicate that ketometer readings were performed, not the ketometer values. All data for patients included in the study were collected and de-identified. Pathology reports were reviewed and confirmed that all patients received a diagnosis of cerebral glioma.  Diet description  Patients were not given a specific meal plan to follow but were instructed by a registered dietician on the theory and practice of the ketogenic diet (generically, switching from carbohydrate metabolism to fat metabolism and thereby producing ketone bodies).",42f58c0a-5871-4ded-a185-5bbf7f517319
2,methods2," Several versions of the ketogenic diet are published [23]. We prescribed a primarily plant-based and high-fiber ketogenic diet. Criticisms of the standard ketogenic diet include that it is low in fiber and can result in constipation and that it provides limited food choices. We advised patients to maximize eating green leafy vegetables, focus on tracking net carbohydrates, and disregard the consumption of fiber carbohydrates. Patients were encouraged to use olive oil, grass-fed butter, medium-chain triglycerides, and coconut oils and to avoid processed vegetable oils, trans fats, and fried foods. Patients were told to avoid grains, bread, pasta, potatoes, corn, and tropical fruits. Berries were allowed in limited quantities, and the total number of net carbohydrates was to be kept below 20 g per day. Intermittent fasting with a limited eating window of less than eight to 10 hours per day was reported by several patients.",ee303c0a-626f-4a30-bf5a-50db0a75867b
3,methods3," Blood serum-based ketometers were used to assure nutritional ketosis via both at-home (patient-reported) and in-clinic measurements, but the frequency of ketometer testing varied substantially.  Radiographic surveillance  Preoperative, postoperative, and interval surveillance magnetic resonance imaging was independently reviewed. Tumor progression was defined by the progressive enlargement of T1-weighted contrast-enhancing regions. Consideration was given to the progression of cerebral edema as observed on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)) image sequences. Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology (Response Assessment in Neuro oncology (RANO)) criteria were applied to judge response to therapy and progression when appropriate within the study.

7,results2," ==== Body pmcIntroduction  High-grade glioma has remained resistant to standard medical therapies despite multiple advances in surgical, radiation, and chemotherapeutic options over the past few decades. Average survival for patients with treated glioblastoma (glioblastoma (GBM)) has been remarkably stable (approximately 12-16 months), with less than 2% of patients surviving more than five years [1]. Furthermore, patients who are long-term survivors of this disease with standard therapy experience significant cognitive and quality-of-life compromises. Most long-term survivors are reported to have treatment-induced dementia [2]. In 2016, the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)) revised the diagnostic criteria to differentiate an oligodendroglioma from an astrocytoma by requiring that 1p/19q co-deletion status be recognized as the requirement for oligodendroglioma diagnosis [3].",d28aaa95-e40c-4b5f-9e40-2577de9bc9ee
8,results3," This criterion is clinically relevant given the significant survival advantage associated with an anaplastic oligodendroglioma diagnosis (five-year survival, 69%), compared with an anaplastic astrocytoma diagnosis (two-year average survival) [2,4].  Alterations in the metabolism of cancer cells were noted nearly 100 years ago by Dr. Otto Warburg [5]. Warburg won the Nobel Prize in 1931 for unraveling the oxygen-transferring ferment of respiration [6]. He had become obsessed with the altered metabolism of cancer cells as early as 1924 and published numerous papers on his theory on the metabolic origins of cancer cells, including seminal papers in Science in 1959 [7]. His theory was hotly debated and not widely accepted at the time; however, his insights have nearly been forgotten over the past century. Increased glycolysis and diminished tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and oxidative phosphorylation are seen very early in tumorigenesis and constitute one of the hallmarks of cancer [8].",e4090275-2a59-48fa-949b-e7bd0068f07c
9,results4," Cancer cells use up to 18 times as much glucose as normal cells, because cancer cells use the inefficient metabolic process of fermentation (even in the presence of oxygen), as opposed to aerobic respiration, to produce adenosine triphosphate; this difference between cancer cells and healthy cells can be observed on positron emission tomography scans using fluorodeoxyglucose [9]. In 2011, Hanahan and Weinberg [10] extended the list of cancer hallmarks to include metabolic reprogramming, or deregulated cellular energetics, as an emerging hallmark and a potential cancer target. Recently, researchers have a newfound interest in attempting to exploit the need of cancer cells for excess glucose, compared with normal cells, as a therapeutic target [11,12].  Ketogenic metabolic therapy (Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT)), a term coined in a review of six papers on the ketogenic diet in gliomas by Winter et al.",f6a1a1db-43e2-47cf-a161-dda175b4900a
10,results5," in 2017 [13], is administered by prescribing variations of diets that are high in fat and low in carbohydrates with moderate protein intake to produce a naturally occurring state of nutritional ketosis [14]. Specific nutritional genomic variations between individuals explain why some people more easily obtain a state of nutritional ketosis compared with others [15]. Intermittent fasting is used for some patients as a means of increasing the degree and consistency of nutritional ketosis. Nutritional ketosis is defined by blood ketone concentrations greater than 0.5 mM [16,17], whereas “therapeutic ketosis” is considered more effective when the concentration of ketones in the blood is between 3.0 and 6.0 mM [18].  In the simplest understanding, depriving cancer cells of glucose with a strict low-carbohydrate diet should cause the cancer cells to be deprived of energy and become more stressed and susceptible to chemotherapy and radiation treatments [19].",74b35bfc-916f-4f47-9384-f52c5e239c8c
11,results6," Normal cells, and specifically neurons, function very well using ketones for fuel. Furthermore, being in a state of nutritional ketosis affords several favorable side effects in treating brain tumors, including decreasing edema by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway and by decreasing numerous inflammatory cytokines [19]. Laboratory animals with brain tumor model experiments treated with ketogenic formula had significantly less edema than their counterparts who were fed regular chow [20]. It was also noted that beta-hydroxybutyrate, the major ketone body in the bloodstream, acts as a histone deacetylase inhibitor [21]. This inhibition results in increased susceptibility of cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapy treatments by multiple epigenetic mechanisms [20-22].",e8c8a3a7-abbc-4c84-b17a-c7efe0316554
12,results7," Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown striking results when adding Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) to radiation and chemotherapy approaches for cancer cells in culture and in live animal brain tumor models [19-21]. Striking results were published by Zeng and colleagues [20], who showed that, in a murine glioblastoma (GBM) tumor model, cancer responded much better to treatment when the animals were fed a ketogenic diet. When animals were fed ketogenic formula (Ketocal; Nutricia, Zoetermeer, Netherlands) while receiving radiation and chemotherapy, 75% were completely cured of the glioblastoma (GBM) tumor implant and were proven to be tumor-free at one year when euthanized. Control animals fed normal chow lived an average of 18 weeks, and all died of tumor progression, with no animals surviving beyond 24 weeks [20]. Clinical applications of glioma treatment with Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) are limited [23]. In 2019, Woodhouse et al.",2d0e1a82-fe57-4cdf-a0c4-d60fb7672bc6
13,results8," [24] provided a retrospective analysis of 29 patients treated with a modified Atkins diet, in which all patients achieved ketosis during the study interval, demonstrating the feasibility and safety of maintaining ketosis during surveillance for gliomas. They analyzed survival only for patients who were at least two years from diagnosis; among patients with glioblastoma (GBM) (n=15), only four met the two-year survival criteria, which was consistent with existing non-Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) literature in which patients were treated using the standard of care. Hu et al. recently published a small phase 1 trial that showed safety and markedly favorable responses in some patients [25]. Despite these findings, no thorough studies have been published on Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) among patients with glioma.",f1005538-f6d5-482a-bddc-36b0e0ff12ae
14,results9,"  These findings and anecdotal observation prompted a retrospective review of a single surgeon’s glioma patient population, selecting patients who reported adherence to a ketogenic diet as metabolic therapy for glioma. The resulting patient population is proposed to serve as preliminary evidence for metabolic therapy and to encourage rigorous study in this promising frontier for glioma management.

No patients reported unexpected adverse effects of Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT). On the contrary, many of the patients reported overall improvements in subjective quality-of-life assessments using the 36-item Short Form Survey during the Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) treatment interval. These quality-of-life assessments were not consistently available and, therefore, were not included in the data set for analysis.

32,discussion0," The standard of care for patients with high-grade gliomas has continued to provide very disappointing results with respect to both tumor control and quality of life. The most promising recent results in a large trial were reported when TTFs were added to the Stupp protocol in a large European trial [26]. The median survival of the group treated with TTFs increased to 20.9 months compared with 16 months in the standard cohort. However, the median duration of progression-free survival was only 6.7 months in the TTF group and only 4.0 months in the group that received standard care. A better understanding of the underlying disease process is needed to arrive at a more effective treatment strategy. Synergistic drug combinations combined with precision-medicine approaches have been suggested, with an understanding of the multiple mechanisms of resistance to the standards of care [27].",34b61e24-cefc-4583-81e1-3f5714ded065
33,discussion1,"  Temozolomide therapy has been shown to strongly suppress proinflammatory cytokines and escape the immune response as a mechanism of resistance and later tumor recurrence [27]. Polo-like kinase 4 was also shown to be markedly upregulated in some glioblastoma (GBM)s as a mechanism of radiation resistance and was associated with an even worse prognosis with standard care. Ma et al. [28] reported that the FoxM1/BUB1B signaling pathway was implicated in tumorigenesis and radiation resistance in some glioblastoma (GBM)s and was also associated with a worse-than-normal prognosis when detected with molecular profiling.  These are only a sampling of the many molecular aberrations and variations in high-grade gliomas that result in resistance to standard of care and a poor prognosis for almost all patients. We, therefore, propose that reconsidering the potential of the metabolic underpinnings of the disease may lead to a more effective combination of treatment options.",7061fa7a-f3ce-493f-b0b5-50fcbd7b739a
34,discussion2,"  Although our findings are preliminary, a mean (SD) progression-free survival of 13.3 months (8.4) months among patients with glioblastoma (GBM)s receiving Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) (n=8) and 17.5 (13.8) months among patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade III glioma (n=7) is suggestive of a significant role for Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) in the treatment of high-grade glioma. These results are favorable to other interventions for recurrent high-grade gliomas. This finding warrants further prospective analysis in a larger patient population. The failure of patient 10 to achieve a response after reinitiating Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) following a cessation interval was suggestive of a certain adaptation, possibly a conversion to glutamine fermentation, after which Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) efforts may become futile.",7d7b5831-53d8-435c-a54e-581640a08269
35,discussion3,"  The finding of both PPAR-a and SLC-22A5 polymorphisms in patient 1 posed a surprising challenge for maintaining Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) in that patient. PPAR-a is a transcription factor activated by fatty acids that plays a critical role in the starvation response. Fatty acid-bound PPAR-a imparts downstream molecular changes that impact anti-inflammatory actions and cellular metabolic enzymes [29,30]. This patient’s gene variant, RS 1800206 CG, is associated with increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased triglycerides and C-reactive protein compared to the normal gene variant. He was able to maintain therapeutic ketosis while in prolonged fasts but struggled to have measurable ketones in response to a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet without time-restricted eating, presumably due to this variant.",420ff160-c50d-4ae8-bd11-7cfca74a73d8
36,discussion4,"  SLC-22A5 is an important protein family within the solute carrier superfamily, which is critical within the digestive system due to its role in oxidative phosphorylation [31]. These carrier proteins shuttle the substrates for metabolism along the mitochondrial membrane. Many well-described rare mitochondrial diseases result from gene mutations severe enough to cause complete loss of function of these carrier proteins [31]. It is common to have less-severe single-nucleotide polymorphisms of some of these genes, which nevertheless cause some less-noticeable pathologies. Patient 1 had two homozygous variants (RS17622208 and RS2073643) that could have impacted carnitine transport and was, therefore, given L-carnitine supplementation. He appeared to respond to this as evidenced by increased blood ketone levels following supplementation. The markedly negative response to an IDH-1 blocker in this patient with mutant IDH-1 was unexpected and tragic for this patient.",384cbb8a-8c01-4826-a0c2-e4fca8bd44b6
37,discussion5," It is unknown if this agent contributed to widespread leptomeningeal dissemination; however, it was clearly not helpful for his case, and caution for other patients is warranted until further data are available.  The weaknesses of this study are extensive given the variety of pathological subtypes of glioma diagnosed and the variations in other therapies used within the limited sample of 16 patients. The differing stages of progression at the time of initiating Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) and the lack of consistent adherence to Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) within the study population also significantly affect the reliability of the findings. The patients also received a multitude of therapeutic interventions within the surveillance interval, such as repeat resection, laser interstitial thermal therapy, TTFs, adjuvant radiotherapy, salvage chemotherapy, and radiosurgery and brachytherapy.",515163be-8fca-43d3-8da3-39f4b3688004
38,discussion6," The application of these multiple treatment modalities resulted in a heterogeneous patient population, which further limits the strength of the evidence. Importantly, given the application of concurrent therapies, it is difficult to attribute any radiographic response to Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) directly versus the other treatment modalities these patients received.  Conclusions  Despite the limitations of this study, Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) appeared to convey a substantial survival advantage to those patients who diligently adhered to the dietary regimen, highlighting that this therapy, when strictly applied, holds promise as a therapeutic intervention. The radiographic and clinical responses of some of these patients were truly extraordinary.",05bb9ed6-bb7c-47e3-94ed-8fbcccc6cde9
39,discussion7," The difference in response to Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) evident within the series is suggestive of the potential value for nutritional genomics evaluation of patients for optimization of Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT), which would personalize and enhance the delivery of this therapy. The preliminary evidence in this report informs the literature of the role Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) can play for patients with glioma and should prompt an extensive, prospective, quantitative, controlled study of this therapy.
