0,methods0," Mice  C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. To generate adipose tissue-specific pregnancy zone protein (PZP) transgenic (pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG) mice, the DNA fragment of the adipose-specific promoter/enhancer from the adiponectin gene together with the pregnancy zone protein (PZP)-coding sequence was guided into C57BL/6J mice via a shotgun method at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG-positive mice were mated with wild-type (WT) mice to generate pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG and littermate WT control mice. The mice were housed in an SPF laboratory animal-house (Institute of Zoology of Beijing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) at room temperature (24°C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The high-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD)) comprises 60% fat, 20% kcal from carbohydrates, and 20% from protein (MD12033, Medicience).",4a38a9c9-3a9e-4704-b12b-8bf7074dc7c2
1,methods1," All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.  Intermittent Fasting Regimen  We used a 1:3 diet regimen as in our previous study. In a whole intermittent fasting regimen (IFR) cycle, the mice were food deprived for 1 day and then re-fed for 3 days. This regimen provided the mice with sufficient time to compensate for the reduced amount of food intake after 1-day fasting. No difference in cumulative food intake between the intermittent fasting regimen (IFR) group and normal diet group enabled us to examine the effects of intermittent fasting regimen (IFR), independent of caloric intake difference.  Body Composition Measurements  The total fat and lean mass of mice were measured by the Small Animal Body Composition Analysis and Imaging System (MesoQMR 23 060H-I; Nuimag Corp., Shanghai, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions .",abdb2603-8c1b-4f4a-b73f-a1184c8424ec
2,methods2,"  Metabolic Rate and Physical Activity  Oxygen consumption was measured when mice were fed upon high fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks without a difference in body weights. Mice were acclimated to the system, maintained at 24°C in a 12-h light/dark cycle for 20–24 h, and fasted VO2 and VCO2 of each mouse were measured during the next 24 h with food deprivation. Then, re-fed VO2 and VCO2 were obtained with free access to food and water. Physical activity was determined at 12 weeks of age with a TSE LabMaster (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany) .  Glucose Tolerance Tests  After the last IF cycle, mice were subjected to a glucose tolerance test (glucose tolerance test (GTT)). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed as follows: after food deprivation for 16 h, mice were intraperitoneally injected with glucose solution (1.5 g/kg body weight).",6e126c3b-d986-46f3-ad64-70df73839691
3,methods3," Plasma glucose was measured with a glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics Corp) before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection .  Insulin Tolerance Tests  After the last IF cycle, mice were subjected to insulin tolerance tests (insulin tolerance test (ITT)s). insulin tolerance test (ITT)s were performed as follows: after food deprivation for 4 h, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 0.75 IU/kg. Plasma glucose was measured using a glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics Corp) before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after injection.  Histological Analysis  For H&E staining, tissues fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were embedded in paraffin. Sections (4-μm-thick) were stained and observed under a ×10 or ×20 objective lens. For tissue staining, white adipose tissue (WAT) was dissected from EP and incubated on ice with 2% PFA overnight, followed by permeable treatment with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% FBS in PBS for 1 h at RT.",141347ba-e117-4dd8-a0bd-4aa180f07151
4,methods4," Next, tissues were removed into a staining buffer containing the primary antibody (anti-CD31, ab182981) at 4°C for 24 h and then incubated with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. The whole EP was scanned under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 780).  Western Blotting  To detect relative protein expression levels, a series of Western blots were performed. Briefly, tissue proteins were obtained by additional chopping with a T10 basic ULTRA-TURRAX handheld homogenizer (IKA, Germany). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes with proteins were incubated with the following antibodies overnight at 4°C: anti-UCP1 (ab155117, Abcam), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (ab221679, Abcam), and anti-tubulin (2146, CST) and then were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.",2203ac2b-37fc-454e-902b-3857c5809c85
5,methods5," All signals were visualized and analyzed by densitometric scanning (Image Quant TL 7.0; GE Healthcare Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The intensity values of the bands were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States).  Real-Time qPCR  Total RNA from tissues and cells was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) and reverse-transcribed with high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Promega, United States). The relative expression of genes was detected by the real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Light Cycler 480, Roche, Sweden) with SYBR Green Master Mix (Promega, United States).  Statistical Analysis  To each group, 7–11 mice were randomly assigned to reduce the individual differences. For the in vitro experiment, a minimum of four replicates were designed. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism version 9.0.",807692db-0892-40b1-be83-8035d8d1d0c5

7,results0," The Anti-Obesity Effect of an Intermittent Fasting Regimen Was Enhanced in Pregnancy Zone Protein Transgenic Mice  pregnancy zone protein (PZP) is mainly expressed in the liver and a small amount in the kidney, immune cells, and brain tissue. Our previous studies have shown that liver-derived pregnancy zone protein (PZP) undertakes almost all metabolic regulatory functions regulated by intermittent fasting regimen (IFR). To investigate whether this difference in function is caused by tissue-specific modification, we constructed a transgenic mice model that specifically overexpresses pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in adipose tissue under the regulation of adiponectin promoter (pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice).  As the following results show, overexpression of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in adipose tissue did not affect body weight gain of mice fed with a high-fat diet containing 60% fat (Figure 1A).",c078d0d7-ba33-410d-9a9d-b5fb895ec3f4
8,results1," For the same period induced by the high-fat diet, mice on the intermittent fasting diet gained less weight than those on the normal diet, and pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG in adipose tissue amplifies the anti-obesity effects of the intermittent fasting diet (Figure 1B), and such weight change was mainly caused by the reduction of fat proportion but did not affect the lean mass of mice (Figure 1C). These results indicated that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice were less sensitive to high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity.  FIGURE 1 Anti-obesity effect of intermittent fasting regimen (IFR) is enhanced in pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice.

According to our further measurements, the weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT), SUB, EP, and liver was significantly lighter in TG mice than in WT mice (Figure 1D). The results of tissue section experiments directly demonstrated that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice had less fat storage in fat and liver cells under the dietary measure (Figure 1E).",7872b911-3fdf-4e31-9fe0-6865b6e6c37b
10,results3," Taken together, the overexpression of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in adipose tissue helps anti-diet-induced obesity (diet induced obesity (DIO)), and there are no necessary modifications of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) by the liver for metabolic regulation.  Pregnancy Zone Protein-Meditated Improvements in White Adipose Tissue Metabolic Activity Depend on Energy Expenditure  To explore the metabolic effects of overexpression of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in adipose tissue, glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) tests were used to measure the glucose utilization rate of mice after 10 weeks of IF treatment. pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice showed increased ability to clear exogenous glucose (Figure 2A) and were more sensitive to insulin stimulation (Figure 2B). These results indicate that overexpression of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in adipose tissue improves the metabolic disorder induced by high fat diet (HFD).",4c12f2f9-bd62-42b2-8fea-6279ecbdfc75

(E,F) Food consumption (E) and physical activity (F) of WT and pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice (n = 9).  Furthermore, we found that the overall energy metabolism of TG mice was increased (Figures 2C,D), while the food intake and exercise of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice were not changed compared with WT mice (Figures 2E,F).",25b73f86-8b3c-42a7-94ef-ec97b62b9763
12,results5," These results suggest that the anti-obesity and metabolic improvement effects caused by pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG depend on the increase in diet-induced energy expenditure.  Brown Adipose Tissue Activity was Increased in Pregnancy Zone Protein Transgenic Mice  brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the major organ of adaptive thermogenesis, and thermogenesis was inhibited under IF when pregnancy zone protein (PZP) was deleted . To explore the effects of adipose tissue-derived pregnancy zone protein (PZP) on brown adipose tissue (BAT), pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice and WT mice were subjected to high fat diet (HFD) and IF stimulation. Under the monitoring of an infrared camera, we found that the temperature of the interscapular region of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice was significantly higher than that of wild-type mice (Figure 3A), suggesting more heat production in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of TG mice.",71367575-1458-4866-b99f-3f7f9b52ce93
13,results6,"  FIGURE 3 brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity was increased in pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice.

14,results7,"  brown adipose tissue (BAT) heat generation mainly depends on UCP1 protein to convert the chemical energy generated by the hydrolysis of fat and carbohydrate into heat. Subsequent molecular experiments demonstrated that the transcription of heat production-related genes and the abundance of proteins, such as UCP1 and PGC1a, in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice were significantly increased (Figures 3B,C,E). Tissue section experiments showed that fat accumulation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) cells was significantly reduced (Figure 3D). These results indicate that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG significantly increased the thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT).  Pregnancy Zone Protein Transgenic Promotes SUB Remodeling Against High-Fat Diet  In addition to the classic brown adipose tissue (BAT), the beige cells present in white adipose tissue can also specifically express UCP1 protein, thus promoting energy consumption and heat release.",a350e939-dd89-473d-ace5-d3c99f241371
15,results8," The discovery of beige fat in human has made it a hot topic in treating obesity. To explore whether pregnancy zone protein (PZP) can induce thermogenesis in white adipose tissue, we detected UCP1 protein in subcutaneous and epididymis white adipose tissue. Under the condition of IF treatment, a small amount of UCP1 protein was expressed in mice, while the abundance of UCP1 protein in SUB of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice was significantly higher than that of WT mice (Figures 4A,B). Meanwhile, in SUB, the mRNA level of TBX1, the main gene for inducing beige production, was significantly increased, indicating the potential for pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG to induce beige production (Figure 4C). Vascular formation and UCP1 protein expression are the main factors promoting white adipose tissue (WAT) thermogenesis during intermittent fasting regimen (IFR).",afc861b9-d5ef-4cfb-916d-5a9f730ce6bf
16,results9," Our results show that the abundance of VR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2), a signature protein for angiogenesis, was significantly increased in pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice (Figure 4A). Furthermore, we found that the expression of key enzymes involved in glycolysis was significantly upregulated in TG mice (Figure 4D), suggesting that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG accelerated glucose metabolism in mice. In conclusion, overexpression of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in adipose tissue could increase energy dissipation by accelerating glucose metabolism and heat production in white adipose tissue.  FIGURE 4 pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG promotes white adipose tissue (WAT) remodeling against high fat diet (HFD).

Pregnancy Zone Protein Transgenic Promotes Angiopoiesis in EP  As in subcutaneous adipose tissue, the VR2 protein was increased in epididymis adipose tissue between the two groups. To further verify the effect of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG on vascular formation in mice, whole-tissue staining was performed on flat areas of EP from TG and WT mice (Figure 5A). Confocal microscopy showed that the number of blood vessels in EP of TG mice was significantly higher than that of WT mice.",4328deaa-7fb4-47fa-8a82-60b73a18aa12
18,results11," Subsequently, the qPCR test showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A and PECAM, which promote angiogenesis, were significantly upregulated in the EP of TG mice (Figure 5B). These results demonstrate that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in adipose tissue could promote vascular formation in white adipose tissue (WAT).  FIGURE 5 pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG promotes angiopoiesis in epididymis adipose tissue.

19,discussion0," It has been demonstrated that liver-derived pregnancy zone protein (PZP) amplified the weight loss effect of intermittent fasting regimen (IFR) , but it is unclear whether the metabolic regulation of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) requires liver tissue-specific modification. This study found that the overexpression of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in adipose tissue can also activate the thermogenesis effect of brown adipose tissue (BAT). More interestingly, the beige fat formation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue and vascularization in the subcutaneous and epididymal visceral adipose tissue was increased in pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice, demonstrating pregnancy zone protein (PZP) itself regulates energy conversion of adipose tissue types under intermittent fasting regimen (IFR).",125f0137-53a5-42d1-b877-0dba24dda294
20,discussion1,"  Vasculation of adipose is often a co-occurring phenomenon with browning induced by external cues, which is dependent on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 signaling but not UCP1 . In this study, we found that the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2 in white adipose tissue (WAT) was markedly upregulated in pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice under intermittent fasting regimen (IFR). This demonstrates that the pregnancy zone protein (PZP)-induced thermogenesis was not only dependent on UCP1 but also on angiogenesis in adipose tissue. Our mice model phenotypically resembles the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A adipose-specific transgenic mice in which local upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A in adipocytes improves vascularization and causes a “browning” of white adipose tissue (WAT), accompanied with upregulated UCP1 and PGC1α .",b0d0e486-d93a-496c-b5c8-0626875879dc
21,discussion2," Interestingly, Sun et al. (2014) continued to study depot effect using the brown adipose tissue (BAT)-specific vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A expression mice model and found that locally overexpressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A in brown adipose tissue (BAT) was easier to clarify the role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation than the previous model. Although pregnancy zone protein (PZP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A are both secreted proteins, expression at different locations could still reflect tissue specificity.  Meanwhile, recent studies have reported that glycogen metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT) was required for UCP1 expression that is depended on the P38 MAPK pathway . Our study found that glucose metabolism was more active in pregnancy zone protein (PZP) TG mice, suggesting that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) may be an important link between glucose metabolism and beige formation.",f9decc0d-9085-4353-8e2e-420f8185ea21
22,discussion3," As an immunosuppressant, pregnancy zone protein (PZP) protects the fetus from the mother’s immune system; our results confirmed that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) overexpression significantly alleviated high-fat-diet-induced inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT). These findings also enlighten us that other immune disorders, such as aging and diabetes, may be related to impaired pregnancy zone protein (PZP) function.  Recently, pregnancy zone protein (PZP) has been reported to act as a potential biomarker for screening the risk of lung adenocarcinoma  or prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma  in patients with type 2 diabetes. Subsequent studies have reported that the expression of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in tumor tissues was lower than that in normal tissues, and the loss of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) would promote the progression of breast cancer (Zheng et al., 2018; Wu et al.",b8fc8eb0-f208-4907-9152-63d8a40b4222
23,discussion4,", 2021), laying the foundation for the potential of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) protein in tumor therapy. These emerging studies show that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) is important for the maintenance of normal body functions and deserves further study. To rule out the effects of food intake, we used a 1:3 diet regimen. A prolonged high-fat diet may attenuate IF cycle-induced thermogenesis , which is probably one of the reasons for not detecting beige fat in epididymal visceral adipose tissue. intermittent fasting regimen (IFR) with a shorter refeeding duration, such as fasting every other day (Li et al., 2017a) and every 2 days, might be more effective at inducing pregnancy zone protein (PZP)-mediated mobilization of metabolic activity.  Many trials proved that intermittent fasting regimen (IFR) could effectively reduce body weight and improve cardiovascular events, diabetes, and other symptoms (Patterson and Sears, 2017; Harney et al., 2021; Maifeld et al., 2021).",eea33813-223c-4a61-9fa9-9ed797f4bcd3
24,discussion5," Several prospective clinical studies have counted different intermittent fasting regimen (IFR) effects and claim the superiority of one regimen or another for metabolic disorders. But, the lack of randomized control and the various eating time windows among studies make horizontal comparisons between studies difficult; selecting which regimen is the best remains unclear.  In recent years, several clinical studies with strict eating windows have quantified the effects of intermittent fasting regimen (IFR). Sutton et al. (2018) reported that, compared with a 12-h eating window, eating for 6 h per day (8:00 a.m.–3:00 p.m.) could significantly improve the insulin sensitivity of prediabetic patients, islet β-cell insulin secretion, oxidative stress, and blood pressure.  A single-arm study by Wilkinson et al.",96f5e16b-211b-4f7f-aafc-07d7d53f16d9
25,discussion6," (2020) demonstrated that a 10-h eating window and 14-h fasting regimen for 12 weeks resulted in a 3% average weight loss, a 4% reduction in waist circumference, and improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol in patients with metabolic syndrome. Duration of eating, rhythm cycle, and food composition significantly affected intermittent fasting regimen (IFR) ; large-scale randomized controlled trials involving volunteers and long-term follow-up carried out in multi-center cooperation will provide objective advice for establishing effective dietary strategies.  In summary, we report that local expression of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) in white adipose tissue (WAT) significantly induces beige browning as well as angiogenesis in adipose.",56763363-9384-4d19-ac7b-137584afecc7
26,discussion7," Unlike previous studies, in which liver-derived pregnancy zone protein (PZP) appeared to promote only brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, our results suggest that white adipose tissue (WAT) browning also plays an important role in the promotion of energy metabolism by pregnancy zone protein (PZP).
