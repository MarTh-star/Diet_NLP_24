0,background0,"Time-restricted feeding (Time restricted feeding (TRF)), in some cases also referred as intermittent fasting, is a feeding pattern where all nutrient intake is restricted to certain hours of the day with no limitation on nutrient quality or quantity (1, 2). Studies in as early as 1980s proposed that reducing food availability protected against aging and improved life span in mice (3, 4). Recent researches as well as our studies in rodent animals concerning Time restricted feeding (TRF) are increasingly revealing its various beneficial effects, including preventing diet-induced obesity and its associated metabolic disorders (1, 5–8), preventing inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (9, 10), and alleviating hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury (11).",3a7b0114-f234-4149-bf1a-2a4555d8b960
1,background1," The rhythm of feeding can greatly influence the development of liver steatosis and remodel the hepatic circadian metabolome, which suggests a potential mechanism of Time restricted feeding (TRF) (12, 13). By restricting food availability to a certain temporal window at the same time of every day, Time restricted feeding (TRF) can trigger a food-anticipatory activity depending on the endogenous circadian clock (14).  In mammals, the intrinsic circadian system is a complicated feedback network that maintains and regulates proper rhythms in metabolic pathways required for organism homeostasis (15, 16). Mammalian circadian clock contains a central oscillator located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN)) of the hypothalamus and various peripheral tissue, with harmonious bidirectional interactions (17–19).",14dd81e8-6ade-4edc-98e6-28cdb2958df2
2,background2," The molecular bedrock of core circadian clock is composed of a series of diurnally fluctuated proteins, and among which the transcription factors CLOCK, BMAL1 (Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1), Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2), and Period (Per1, Per2, and Per3) act as the core molecules (20, 21). In peripheral organs including liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, similar circadian rhythms also occur with feeding/fasting acting as the primary regulator (16, 18, 22). The core circadian molecule composed of CLOCK:BMAL1 complex is closely connected to cellular metabolism by regulating the cyclic transcription of Nampt (nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase) and directing the cyclic synthesis of NAD± (23, 24). SIRT1 (Sirtuin1), as an NAD±-dependent enzyme, is regulated in this manner and functions as an energy sensor by responding to the cellular levels of metabolic intermediates such as NAD± and NADH (25).",a3d1c72e-5c94-40d2-b7a1-a1ef1c101466
3,background3," Previous studies found that SIRT1 also deacetylates transcription factors that regulate the choice of oxidative or glycolytic metabolic strategy and fatty acid synthesis, namely PPARα (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) and SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) (26, 27).  The desynchronization of normal circadian rhythm is associated with various pathological conditions, among which obesity and related metabolic disorders have become a concerned issue (28). The circadian desynchronization can be implemented using a homozygous CLOCK mutation model, which presents attenuated diurnal rhythm of feeding behavior and obesity (29). On the other side, diet-induced obesity (diet induced obesity (DIO)) also leads to changes in the rhythmicity of core circadian clock proteins. In diet induced obesity (DIO) mice, the expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 was altered associated with other metabolic disorders like leptin resistance and adiponectin deficiency (30, 31).",73965efe-89ce-4771-b5af-95e7fa59a89a
4,background4," In addition, diet induced obesity (DIO) generates comprehensive rhythmic changes in the expression of proteins related to fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, especially SREBP and PPARα (32, 33). Gut microbiota analysis also reveals changes in diet induced obesity (DIO) mice, characterized by a reduction in the Bacteroidetes phylum and an increase in the Firmicutes phylum (34). A few previous studies also tested the circadian rhythmicity of gut microbiota, and suggested distinct differences between normal mice and diet induced obesity (DIO) mice (35–38).  The prevention and treatment for diet induced obesity (DIO) has arose wide discussion, among which Time restricted feeding (TRF) was also intensely studied as a non-pharmaceutical intervention. It has been shown that Time restricted feeding (TRF), by merely changing the external rhythm of feeding, can protect against obesity, inflammation and hepatic steatosis (5, 7, 39).",403e9a08-2877-4e04-9a7d-b83d28e29bae
5,background5," However, the underlying mechanism of Time restricted feeding (TRF) for improving diet induced obesity (DIO)-related disorders is not completely understood. It is reported that Time restricted feeding (TRF) can alter the hepatic expression level of core circadian proteins and mRNAs at certain timepoints of the day, resulting in changes in the circadian rhythmicity (13). And gut microbiota is reported to be another possible mechanism, as Time restricted feeding (TRF) decreases Firmicutes abundance and increases Bacteroidetes abundance (36, 40). In the present study, we subjected mice to Time restricted feeding (TRF) regimen of a high-fat diet for 8 h per day and explored the regulatory effects of Time restricted feeding (TRF) on weight gain and the circadian rhythmicity of hepatic lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. Our findings provided deeper understanding into the use of Time restricted feeding (TRF) as a non-pharmaceutical intervention. ",d0b0374a-7dbd-404e-aad5-35b355cd4922

Time restricted feeding (TRF) Mildly Alters the Circadian Expression of Endogenous Core Clock Genes in Liver To examine whether Time restricted feeding (TRF) also affected the expression of endogenous circadian genes, we tested hepatic mRNA amounts of Per1, Cry1, and Bmal1 using real-time qPCR (Figures 5D–F). The expression of Per1, Cry1, and Bmal1 exhibited clear circadian rhythm in all three groups. Per1 expression peaked at ZT12 and reached bottom at ZT0 in NA mice, with a peak-to-valley ratio of 1.99. Cry1 and Bmal1 expression peaked at ZT0 and reached bottom at ZT12 in NA mice, with peak-to-valley ratios of 13.59 and 12.23, respectively. Both FA and FT mice exhibited similar circadian rhythms of Per1 expression compared to NA mice, peaking at ZT12 and reaching bottom at ZT0, with peak-to-valley ratios of 6.51 and 4.",0a171095-fccd-4daa-a3f0-2e58329e213f

Compared to NA mice, FT mice had lower Per1 levels at ZT0 and ZT20, and comparable Per1 levels at ZT8 and ZT12, which were higher than FA mice. FA and FT mice presented different circadian rhythms of Cry1 expression from NA mice, peaking at ZT20, and reaching bottom at ZT12, with peak-to-valley ratios of 26.34 and 18.31, respectively (Figure 5E). Regarding group comparisons, both FA and FT mice had a lower Cry1 level at ZT0 and a higher Cry1 level at ZT20 compared to NA mice, while Cry1 levels were comparable at ZT8 and ZT12. Regarding Bmal1 level, FA, and FT mice presented different circadian rhythms from NA mice, peaking at ZT20 instead of ZT0, with peak-to-valley ratios of 10.49 and 5.13, respectively (Figure 5F). Compared to NA mice, both FA and FT mice had lower Bmal1 levels at ZT0, which was the peak of NA mice. ",a7b13cf5-8fed-4eb9-a9e4-c3bdb131c7d8
30,discussion0,"Time restricted feeding (TRF), also known as intermittent fasting, by merely restricting nutrient intake into certain hours of the day with no limitation on nutrient quality or quantity, has been widely reported to not only extend life span, but also protect against various pathological conditions, including high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders (1–5, 42, 43). However, the underlying mechanism of how Time restricted feeding (TRF) improves diet induced obesity (DIO)-related disorders is not completely understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of Time restricted feeding (TRF) on the circadian rhythmicity of hepatic lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in mice.  In the present study, under high fat diet (HFD) feeding, FA mice showed more weight gain despite less calorie intake, which may be attributed to less increase in the post-prandial metabolic rate (44).",f7d502d4-d487-44f1-8732-8b6185f4a60d
31,discussion1," FA mice also exhibited significant liver steatosis and elevated hepatic levels of TG compared to NA mice, indicating the high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mice model was well-established in the study. And implementation of Time restricted feeding (TRF) in mice fed high fat diet (HFD) protected against obesity and hepatic lipid accumulation, presented with decreased weight gain, severity of liver steatosis, and hepatic TG level compared to FA mice, which was consistent with previous studies in rodent animals (7, 36, 42, 45). Therefore, it was reasonable to further investigate the underlying mechanism of Time restricted feeding (TRF) using the well-established high fat diet (HFD)-Time restricted feeding (TRF) mice model in the present study. And we mainly focused on changes on gut microbiota and hepatic lipid metabolism.",6775f2a6-def2-4c9f-81b6-44e0eb424f5a
32,discussion2,"  Changes in gut microbiota, characterized by increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria abundance and decreased Bacteroidetes abundance, as well as absence of daily oscillations in the relative abundance of family Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, have been shown to be associated with diet induced obesity (DIO) in rodent animals (34, 37, 46, 47). Our study reported that Time restricted feeding (TRF) resulted in an increase in sample richness, an increase in Bacteroidetes abundance and a decrease in Firmicutes abundance, which was consistent with previous knowledge. Some studies suggested that the gut microbiota composition oscillated in a diurnal pattern in wildtype mice, though the exact oscillation regularities of specific phyla were not well-studied (35, 36).",2633f163-65c2-4e38-9427-67fe7baef3de
33,discussion3," Our study depicted the oscillation pattern of abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria using differences between four distinct ZT timepoints and found Time restricted feeding (TRF) led to clear oscillation patterns in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Subphylum analysis on the relative abundance of family Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae found significant oscillations in NA mice and FT mice, but not in FA mice, suggesting such circadian rhythms exhibited in NA mice were disturbed by high fat diet (HFD) feeding and further restored by Time restricted feeding (TRF). In our study, the circadian rhythm in FT mice is characterized by a prominent increase of Bacteroidetes and decrease of Firmicutes at ZT20, which was not observed in the other two groups. Considering the feeding window of FT mice was restricted between ZT16 and ZT24, ZT20 basically represented the feeding phase in Time restricted feeding (TRF).",5d0f301a-5b40-4be5-9278-9887378049c1
34,discussion4," Therefore, such oscillation patterns indicated a distinct difference triggered by Time restricted feeding (TRF) regimen between feeding and fasting phases.  We then tested the hepatic expression of core circadian clock genes (Per1, Cry1, and Bmal1) and proteins related to lipid metabolism (SIRT1, SREBP, and PPARα) to further understand the molecular mechanism of Time restricted feeding (TRF). The core circadian feedback circuits composed of CLOCK, BMAL1, PER, and CRY maintain the cell-autonomous circadian rhythm, and further regulate cellular metabolism through intermediate proteins including SIRT1, SREBP, and PPARα (48–53). Previous knowledge regarding the oscillation pattern of mRNA Per1, Cry1, and Bmal1 all manifested clear diurnal rhythms with one peak and one bottom, though the specific patterns were not completely consistent (7, 45, 52, 54). In our study, the circadian rhythmicity in NA mice was comparable to previous studies with similar peak and bottom timepoints (7, 45).",34052ad6-a7a7-4b5b-bab6-3da9a3cb17b7
35,discussion5," Comparison between the three experimental groups showed similar oscillation patterns of Per1, Cry1, and Bmal1 between FT and FA mice though the relative amounts were slightly different, and both FT and FA mice exhibited distinct oscillation patterns for Cry1 and Bmal1 compared to NA mice. Therefore, the Time restricted feeding (TRF) regimen in our study did not remodel the hepatic core circadian rhythm altered by high fat diet (HFD) to a natural rhythmicity, which indicated the core circadian clock was altered by the feeding content rather than feeding schedule.  In peripheral organs, SIRT1 regulates the oscillatory rhythms and metabolic pathways as a metabolic rheostat (51, 52). The present study showed similar circadian expression of SIRT1 in NA and FT mice, but not in FA mice, indicating Time restricted feeding (TRF) restored the circadian rhythm of SIRT1 expression.",1751cf15-9265-47ee-8ab8-ae294c5e7d0c
36,discussion6," The protein level of SIRT1 was decreased under conditions with fewer calorie intake (FA and FT mice), and it was consistent with previous studies suggesting Time restricted feeding (TRF) with calorie restriction can prevent liver lipid accumulation and alleviate liver inflammation by decreasing hepatic SIRT1 level (27, 55, 56). Accumulated evidences showed SIRT1 negatively regulate SREBP and PPAR levels in the liver (27, 57–59). Our study also presented a consistent increase in both SREBP and PPARα regardless of ZT timepoints, which was possibly sequential to the changes of SIRT1. SREBP and PPAR are involved in energy metabolism and liver lipid synthesis and accumulation, and elevations in SREBP and PPAR contribute to the development of obesity (60–63). The hepatic circadian rhythm of PPARα is characterized as peak at ZT8 and bottom at ZT20 in NA mice and the rhythm disappeared in FA mice, which was exactly the situation in our study (64).",dceb8e1f-e8ab-4fdd-9671-b8648db219d8
37,discussion7," Our FT mice also exhibited a similar circadian pattern of PPARα with NA mice, suggesting Time restricted feeding (TRF) restored the hepatic rhythm of PPARα. Regarding the hepatic rhythm of SREBP, no clear pattern was found in NA mice, while FA mice had a profoundly higher level at ZT20. Though FT mice also exhibited significant differences between ZT timepoints, its SREBP level at ZT20 was lower than that of FA mice. It indicated that Time restricted feeding (TRF) reduced the high fat diet (HFD)-induced elevation of SREBP at ZT20, but was not able to restore it to a natural condition. Previous studies have suggested the relationship between hepatic metabolism and gut microbiota using fecal microbiota transplantation.",2dd967b3-89bf-4ed7-8512-c48e872d4e6f
38,discussion8," In diet induced obesity (DIO) and high fat diet (HFD)-Time restricted feeding (TRF) mice, changes in the gut microbiota directly altered the metabolism and absorption of fatty acid, which further induced adiposity by stimulating hepatic de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride storage through SREBP (46, 65). However, the causal relationship between changes in the gut microbiota and hepatic lipid metabolism, as well as the reasons for body mass changes under Time restricted feeding (TRF) condition needs further exploration, where metabolic cages and MR imaging shall be used in further researches.  Herein, our study further demonstrated the beneficial effects of Time restricted feeding (TRF), that Time restricted feeding (TRF) altered the average abundance of the gut microflora, as well as the circadian rhythm of proteins related to hepatic lipid metabolism.",008ec959-5df1-4384-a864-1ae96f6f7373
39,discussion9," It suggested this feeding regimen might improve metabolism and restructure circadian rhythms as a non-pharmacological intervention to prevent obesity by modulating the circadian rhythm.  Conclusions In general, we demonstrated that Time restricted feeding (TRF) had protective effects against diet induced obesity (DIO)-related disorders. It mainly functioned by influencing gut microbiota and hepatic metabolism, especially by restoring the circadian rhythm of gut microbiota composition and hepatic lipid metabolism. These findings provide deeper insight into the use of Time restricted feeding (TRF) as a non-pharmacological intervention.
