0,introduction0,"Moderate reduction in ad libitum daily caloric intake without limiting essential and micronutrient access (caloric restriction, CR) is a well-established mechanism to promote longer lifespans and/or healthier aging in a wide range of organisms, including humans [1, 2]. The beneficial effects of CR diets are complex and widespread, but include the preservation over time of mitochondrial bioenergetic functions and redox balance (the difference between the production and removal of damaging oxidative species) [3, 4, 5].  The downside of CR is that it requires daily control of caloric intake, and is thus labor-intensive both for humans and to maintain in a laboratory animal setting. As an alternative to CR, some groups have proposed the use of intermittent fasting (IF), also referred to as intermittent feeding or every other day feeding [6, 7], in which ad libitum feeding periods are alternated with fasting, thus avoiding the strict daily control of caloric intake.",edabc4d7-de4d-4ab2-a72f-74f8c7d2e3b8
1,introduction1," In laboratory animals, this feeding protocol was first described by Carlson and Hoelzel, who observed a slight increment in rat life span [8]. Despite this early result suggesting a lifespan benefit similar to CR, subsequent studies have indicated that the enhancement in life expectancy promoted by IF, if present, is certainly less robust [9, 10]. In humans, IF has been shown to reduce obesity and have positive effects on some pathologies [11, 12].  Despite some similarities such as promoting reduced body weight [13], substantial differences between CR and IF have been uncovered [5] and are, indeed, expected, since CR involves a daily reduction in food intake, while IF changes feeding frequency, and may not always result in a limitation of food ingestion [7, 14]. In fact, while CR enhances insulin sensitivity, we find that long-term IF results in insulin resistance [13].",a0e21743-334c-4f6f-b63c-b375eed46a6c
2,introduction2," We also find that long-term IF enhances tissue oxidant release and oxidative protein modifications in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue [13], while long-term CR is mostly associated with the prevention of oxidative damage [4, 5]. Overall, IF effects on oxidative balance are not yet well determined. This study bridges this knowledge gap, and demonstrates that short-term IF affects redox balance in a tissue-selective manner.

Indeed, we observed that, after a month, IF rats presented lower body weights than AL control rats (Fig. 1A).

Interestingly, respiratory rates in both states were unchanged by IF in the brain (Fig. 2A), heart (Fig. 2B) and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, both ADP-stimulated and oligomycin-inhibited respiratory rates were increased in liver mitochondria isolated from IF animals (Fig. 2D). This increase in respiratory rate was accompanied by a slight increase in respiratory control ratios (the ratio between state 3 and state 4 oxygen consumption) in IF samples, indicating that it reflects an increment in electron transfer capacity and is not a consequence of increased proton leak.  10.1371/journal.pone.0120413.",92271e7f-2270-46b8-8f8a-64fa2f73ec6a

20,results5,"  The activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is often linked to an overall increase in the biogenesis of all mitochondrial enzymes. To test if this was the case, we determined the levels of NRF-1, a transcription factor that activates key mitochondria biogenesis, promoting mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication. Interestingly, NRF-1 levels were unaltered by IF (Fig. 3C). Confirming that liver mitochondrial biogenesis as a whole was not induced by IF, we found that activity of citrate synthase, a citric acid cycle enzyme and mitochondrial mass marker was equal in both groups (Fig. 3D). Altogether, these data suggests that IF induces an enrichment in respiratory chain proteins in liver mitochondria, without an overall increase in mitochondrial mass.",d30fa6a8-bb57-4363-9f63-a557d5d2b1aa
21,results6,"  Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species release is unaltered by IF In addition to determining changes in functional parameters, we measured the release of mitochondrial H2O2, a relatively stable and membrane-permeable reactive oxygen species (ROS) often used as a marker for oxidant production (Fig. 4) [28]. Interestingly, we found that IF did not significantly alter absolute H2O2 release in any tissue (Fig. 4A), although liver release was slightly increased (p = 0.07). IF decreased relative H2O2/O2 release (Fig. 4B) in liver due to the enhanced O2 consumption observed in Figs. 2 and 3, and no change in this ratio was observed in other tissues. Since changes in respiratory rates and mitochondrial coupling are often determinant toward mitochondrial oxidant generation, this result is compatible with our finding that IF does not alter mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters in brain, heart and skeletal muscle.",fe854a85-38c8-4334-a2b6-562274f64a64

23,results8," We thus measured the activities of several key antioxidant enzymes in IF versus AL tissues (Table 1). The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [29], which uses glutathione (glutathione (GSH)) as an electron source to reduce and remove H2O2, was significantly decreased by IF in the skeletal muscle, and unchanged in all other tissues. Glutathione reductase, which restores glutathione (GSH), was unchanged by this dietary intervention, in all tissues. Catalase, which also removes H2O2, was decreased by IF in the brain and unchanged in the other tissues.

On the other hand, IF hearts presented lower levels of glutathione (GSH) oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and, consequently, elevated glutathione (GSH)/glutathione (GSH) oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratios (Table 2), an indicative of a more reduced intracellular environment.  10.1371/journal.pone.0120413.t002Table 2 Glutathione levels.

25,results12," In keeping with the finding that IF hearts were in a more reduced state, as indicated by their glutathione (GSH) oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels (Table 2), we found that protein carbonyls and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were reduced by IF in this tissue (Fig. 5A and 5B). On the other hand, the brain presented enhanced protein carbonylation under IF, which may be a reflection of lower catalase activity. In the liver, a small decrease in the NO2-Tyr signal and a robust increase in protein carbonylation levels was observed. The protein carbonylation effect may be a consequence of the slightly enchanced in oxidant generation in this tissue. There was no dietary-promoted difference in the measured oxidative damage markers in the skeletal muscle.

27,discussion0,"Dietary interventions that reduce body weight relative to ad libitum food intake have received extensive attention due to their mostly positive effects on age-associated diseases [1, 2, 11]. Since aging is often accompanied by increased oxidative tissue damage and loss of mitochondrial activity, many studies involving CR have focused on the bioenergetic and redox effects of this diet [4, 30], mostly showing that it decreased oxidative damage [5]. On the other hand, IF is less studied, and sometimes even confused with CR in the literature [7], so its bioenergetic and redox effects are less clear. We thus sought to determine the redox and bioenergetic effects of IF and found that this diet affects these parameters in complex, tissue-specific manners.  Perhaps the most studied tissue relative to the effects of IF is the brain. Both IF and CR have been related to healthier brain aging by reducing oxidative damage [31–33].",cfb772d4-8e7c-4f14-a0a5-680e46c027b2
28,discussion1," Indeed, IF in aged animals partially restores the loss of some antioxidant enzymes, and decreases 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine DNA adducts accumulated over time [34, 35]. Thus, it was rather surprising to us to find that short-term IF in young animals leads to a significant increase in protein carbonyl signals in the brain of IF rats (Fig. 5), without measurable changes in mitochondrial function (Fig. 2), reactive oxygen species (ROS) release (Fig. 4), Malondialdehyde (MDA) or NO2-Tyr (Fig. 5). This increased protein oxidative damage may be related to a small but significant decrease in brain catalase activity promoted by IF (Table 1). How this early increase in brain oxidative modifications relates to neurological protection in long-term IF models still remains to be uncovered, but the effects are most probably unrelated, since other neuroprotective dietary interventions do not see increments in oxidative damage markers in the brain even in short-term studies [5].",20e7f219-7274-4ed7-939d-ce2ffa0d8940
29,discussion2,"  IF and CR have also have been shown to protect the heart against ischemic injury [33, 36]. This protection has been attributed to activations in antioxidant defenses and stress response systems [35, 37]. In fact, long-term IF has been shown to improve antioxidant defenses and oxidative biomarker levels in the heart [34, 37, 38]. Here, we show that IF has an impact on heart redox state very early on, preventing the oxidation of glutathione (Table 2), protein carbonylation and Malondialdehyde (MDA) formation (Fig. 5).  Despite its central role in the control of energetic metabolism and aging, the skeletal muscle is still poorly studied regarding the effects of IF on redox state. Some long-term studies suggest that, unlike CR, IF may lead to a more oxidized state in this tissue, reducing antioxidant activity [39], increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative protein modification [13].",803d1e59-34ef-4813-898e-a9766255256e
30,discussion3," Our short term study demonstrates that IF decreases glutathione peroxidase activity in the muscle (Table 1), although no changes are seen in glutathione redox state (Table 2) or oxidative damage markers (Fig. 5). Altogether, both our study and literature data suggest that IF does not prevent oxidative damage in the skeletal muscle and may actually worsen the redox condition of this tissue relative to ad libitum diets.  The liver is expected to be largely impacted by a dietary intervention such as IF, which alternates fasting periods with significant overeating. However, the few existent studies reporting IF effects on oxidative balance in the liver did not observe changes in antioxidant defense systems or in DNA and lipid damage [35, 38, 40]. Indeed, the same is observed for CR, in which most work indicates that there is no change in redox balance in the liver [5].",d04c0ada-b227-400a-80ad-37411a404807
31,discussion4," This finding may reflect the fact that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the liver is not overtly modified by changes in metabolic conditions or respiratory substrates [15]. In this study, we find that short-term IF is actually detrimental toward liver oxidative balance, as reflected by the enhanced levels of protein carbonylation (Fig. 5) and induction of glutathione synthesis (Table 2), which may be related to a slight increment in mitochondrial H2O2 release (Fig. 4A). Again, this indicates that not all restrictive dietary interventions with positive health-span effects produce immediate more favorable redox conditions in all organs.  Interestingly, short-term IF had very significant bioenergetic effects in the liver that were not observed in other organs: it increased respiratory capacity, irrespective of the substrate used (Figs. 2, 3), but did not enhance overall mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 3).",39b15bac-5025-40c2-bf01-9b8ddd568dd1
32,discussion5," In a mouse model of IF in which more significant limitation in food intake occurred, IF was also found to increase liver respiratory capacity, but this effect was accompanied by mitochondrial biogenesis [3]. The increased electron transport capacity of IF livers may be important to deal with the large fluctuations in metabolic demands in the liver under this dietary regimen, which alternates fasting periods (characterized by gluconeogenesis and β oxidation) with overeating (which promotes liver glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis).  Overall, our studies show that IF promotes complex and tissue-specific changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and tissue redox state in a manner that is distinct from that observed in other restrictive dietary interventions. How these changes relate to both the desirable and deleterious long-term results of this dietary intervention, and how they relate to human responses to repeated fasting cycles, remains to be determined.",af586d1a-2239-4baf-84f5-9d809bfdbf07
