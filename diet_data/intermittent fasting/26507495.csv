0,background0,"Fasting, the voluntary abstinence from food intake for a specified period of time, is a well-known practice associated with many religious and spiritual traditions. In fact, this ascetic practice is referenced in the Old Testament, as well as other ancient texts such the Koran and the Mahabharata. In humans, fasting is achieved by ingesting little to no food or caloric beverages for periods that typically range from 12 h to 3 weeks. Muslims, for example, fast from dawn until dusk during the month of Ramadan, while Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and Hindus traditionally fast on designated days or periods [1]. Fasting is distinct from caloric restriction (CR), in which daily caloric intake is chronically reduced by up to 40 %, but meal frequency is maintained [2]. In contrast to fasting, starvation is a chronic nutritional deficiency that is commonly incorrectly used as a substitute for the term “fasting”.",f780662e-c304-4004-81c0-a19fc96e2346
1,background1," Starvation could also refer to some extreme forms of fasting, which can result in an impaired metabolic state and death. However, starvation typically implies chronic involuntary abstinence of food, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies and health impairment. While a prolonged period of fasting is difficult to perform for the normal population, an intermittent fasting (IF) protocol has been shown to produce higher compliance [3]. Typically, IF is defined by a complete or partial restriction in energy intake (between 50 and 100 % restriction of total daily energy intake) on 1–3 days per week or a complete restriction in energy intake for a defined period during the day that extends the overnight fast. The most studied of the above form of IF is Ramadan fasting: during the holy month of Ramadan, which varies according to the lunar calendar, Muslims abstain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sunset.",0a8434f9-45ca-4181-90e8-d50265536cec
2,background2," The effects of Ramadan have been extensively investigated, not only on health outcomes [1, 4–8], but also on exercise performance [9–16]. Moreover, in recent years a focus on other forms of IF, unrelated to religious practice, has emerged. One such form, alternate day fasting (Alternate day fasting (ADF); fasting every other day) is organized with alternating “feast days,” on which there is an “ad libitum” energy intake, and “fast days” with reduced or null energy intake.  A growing body of evidence suggests that, in general, IF could represent an useful tool for improving health in general population due to reports of improving blood lipids [17–20] and glycaemic control [3], reducing circulating insulin [21], decreasing blood pressure [1, 21–23], decreasing inflammatory markers [7] and reducing fat mass even during relatively short durations (8–12 weeks) [23].",2e332776-691f-48d2-a43e-4c4bde6b1f8b
3,background3," These reported effects are probably mediated through changes in metabolic pathways and cellular processes such as stress resistance [24], lipolysis [3, 17, 25–27], and autophagy [28, 29]. One particular form of IF which has gained great popularity through mainstream media is the so-called time-restricted feeding (time restricted feeding (TRF)). time restricted feeding (TRF) allows subjects to consume ad libitum energy intake within a defined window of time (from 3–4 h to 10–12 h), which means a fasting window of 12–21 h per day is employed. A key point concerning the IF approach is that generally calorie intake is not controlled, but the feeding times are.  In sports, IF is studied mainly in relationship with Ramadan period [9–16], whilst time restricted feeding (TRF) has become very popular among fitness practitioners claiming supposed effects on maintenance of muscle mass and fat loss.",9b9e6162-d3c2-4282-8555-a8bbc5232206
4,background4," Very limited scientific information is available about time restricted feeding (TRF) and athletes, and mixed results have been reported [22, 30, 31]. We demonstrated very recently [30] that time restricted feeding (TRF) did not affect total body composition nor had negative effects on muscle cross-sectional area after 8 weeks in young previously-untrained men performing resistance training, despite a reported reduction in energy intake of ~650 kcal per fasting day in the time restricted feeding (TRF) group. Thus the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of an isoenergetic time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol on body composition, athletic performance, and metabolic factors during resistance training in healthy resistance trained males. We hypothesized that the time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol would lead to greater fat loss and improvements in health-related biomarkers as compared to a typical eating schedule.

5,methods0,"Subjects Thirty-four resistance-trained males were enrolled through advertisements placed in Veneto region’s gyms. The criteria for entering the study were that subjects must have performed resistance training continuously for at least 5 years (training 3–5 days/week with at least 3 years experience in split training routines), be presently engaged in regular resistance training at the time of recruitment, be life-long steroid free, and have no clinical problems that could be aggravated by the study procedures.  Fifty-three subjects responded to the advertisement, but 7 were excluded for previous use of anabolic steroids, and 12 declined participation after explanation of study’s protocol. Therefore, 34 subjects (age 29.21 ± 3.8; weight 84.6 ± 6.2 kg) were randomly assigned to a time-restricted feeding group (time restricted feeding (TRF); n = 17) or standard diet group (ND; n = 17) through computer-generated software.",3ee64eaa-0c5d-45b1-a085-83b8e38e9219

Subjects were instructed to maintain their habitual caloric intake, as measured during the preliminary week of the study (Table 2). During the 8-week experimental period, time restricted feeding (TRF) subjects consumed 100 % of their energy needs divided into three meals consumed at 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., and fasted for the remaining 16 h per 24-h period. ND group ingested their caloric intake as three meals consumed at 8 a.m., 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. This meal timing was chosen to create a balanced distribution of the three meals during the feeding period in the time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol, while the schedule for the ND group maintained a normal meal distribution (breakfast in the morning, lunch at 1 p.m.",e5d874ff-e389-4b2f-a626-59fe82bbdc40

Every week, subjects were contacted by a dietician in order to check the adherence to the diet protocol. The dietician performed a structured interview about meal timing and composition to obtain this information.",ef663d90-ade9-4ee1-8cd3-afe0cd28a300
9,methods5,"  Training Training was standardized for both groups, and all subjects had at least 5 years of continuous resistance training experience prior to the study. Training consisted of 3 weekly sessions performed on non-consecutive days for 8 weeks. All participants started the experimental procedures in the months of January or February 2014.  The resistance training program consisted of 3 different weekly sessions (i.e. a split routine): session A (bench press, incline dumbell fly, biceps curl), session B (military press, leg press, leg extension, leg curl), and session C (wide grip lat pulldown, reverse grip lat pulldown and tricep pressdown). The training protocol involved 3 sets of 6–8 repetitions at 85–90 % 1-RM, and repetitions were performed to failure (i.e. the inability to perform another repetition with correct execution) with 180 s of rest between sets and exercises [36].",550c5e79-5db1-49f2-832e-1fe430ecc7a5
10,methods6," The technique of training to muscular failure was chosen because it is one of the most common practices for body builders, and it was a familiar technique for the subjects. As expected, the muscle action velocity varied between subjects due to their different anatomical leverage. Although there was slight variation of repetition cadence for each subject, the average duration of each repetition was approximately 1.0 s for the concentric phase and 2.0 s for the eccentric phase [37].  The research team directly supervised all routines to ensure proper performance of the routine. Each week, loads were adjusted to maintain the target repetition range with an effective load. Training sessions were performed between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. Subjects were not allowed to perform other exercises other than those included in the experimental protocol.

Fat mass and fat-free mass were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) (QDR 4500 W, Hologic Inc., Arlington, MA, USA). Muscle areas were calculated using the following anthropometric system. We measured limb circumferences to the nearest 0.001 m using an anthropometric tape at the mid-arm and mid-thigh. We also measured biceps, triceps, and thigh skinfolds to the nearest 1 mm using a Holtain caliper (Holtain Ltd, UK).

Strength tests One repetition maximum (1-RM) for the leg press and the bench press exercises was measured on separate days. Subjects executed a specific warm-up for each 1-RM test by performing 5 repetitions with a weight they could normally lift 10 times. Using procedures described elsewhere [45], the weight was gradually increased until failure occurred in both of the exercises tested. The greatest load lifted was considered the 1-RM. Previously published ICCs for test–retest reliability for leg press and bench press 1-RM testing was 0.997 and 0.997, respectively, in men, with a coefficient of variation of 0.235 for LP and 0.290 for BP [46].",23dbdb31-b21a-4bc2-8ebb-b7a7e1084b80

Blood glucose and insulin levels decreased significantly only in time restricted feeding (TRF) subjects and conformingly a significant improvement of HOMA-IR was detected. In the time restricted feeding (TRF) group, adiponectin increased, leptin decreased (but this was not significant when normalized for fat mass), and T3 decreased significantly compared to ND, without any significant changes in Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).",a300ec0d-7bfa-4334-9f82-a4e901d046b2
21,discussion0,"Fasting is a relatively well-studied metabolic state in sports and physical exercise due to studies of the “Ramadan” period observed by Muslim athletes [12, 14]. However, only a single study has reported its effect during a resistance training program aimed at achieving skeletal muscle growth [30]. Our data demonstrate that during a RT program, time restricted feeding (TRF) was capable of maintaining muscle mass, reducing body fat, and reducing inflammation markers. However, it also reduced anabolic hormones such testosterone and IGF-1.  A key point of the time restricted feeding (TRF) approach utilized in the present study is that total daily calorie intake remained the same while the frequency of meals (i.e. time between meals) was altered. This is dissimilar to many other IF regimens. There are a number of different IF protocols, most of which have the goal of reducing total energy intake.",b8a3b937-6063-47d1-91c0-808ac565b959
22,discussion1," Additionally, unlike Alternate day fasting (ADF) and some other forms of IF, the regimen utilized in the present study employed the same schedule each day, consisting of 16 h fasting and 8 h feeding.  Although IF has received a great amount of attention in recent years, the majority of studies have investigated the effects of IF in overweight, obese or dyslipidemic subjects [19–21, 47–50]. However, little is known about the effects of such nutritional regimens in athletes, and more specifically, in body builders or resistance-trained individuals. The present study provides the first in-depth investigation of IF in this population of athletes. With the exception of reduced triglycerides, our results do not confirm previous research suggesting a positive effect of IF on blood lipid profiles [17–19, 47, 49, 51, 52], however, it has to be taken into account that our subjects were normolipemic athletes.",5ff82afc-f14b-4133-bea1-f9864d9e6ac6
23,discussion2," The magnitude of reduction in triglycerides was also smaller than is typically seen in individuals who have elevated concentrations prior to IF.  As reported, a decrease of fat mass in individuals performing IF was observed. Considering that the total amount of kilocalories and the nutrient distribution were not significantly different between the two groups (Table 2), the mechanism of greater fat loss in IF group cannot simply be explained by changes in the quantity or quality of diet, but rather by the different temporal meal distribution. Many biological mechanisms have been advocated to explain these effects. One is the increase of adiponectin that interacts with adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (activated protein kinase (AMPK)) and stimulates Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) protein expression and mitochondrial biogenesis.",dbc6eb53-06b6-433b-b61e-65c3c5d6cc80
24,discussion3," Moreover, adiponectin acts in the brain to increase energy expenditure and cause weight loss [53]. It is notable that in the present study, the differences in adiponectin between groups remained even when normalized relative to body fat mass, whereas the significant decrease of leptin (that might be considered a unfavorable factor for fat loss) was no longer significant when normalized for fat mass. Other hypothesis is an enhanced thermogenic response to epinephrine [54] or an increase in resting energy expenditure (REE) [55] after brief periods of fasting, but our preliminary data didn’t support this point.  Interestingly, although reductions in the anabolic hormones testosterone and IGF-1 were observed, this did not correspond to any deleterious body composition changes or compromises of muscular strength over the duration of the study.",7c296bd6-1eed-4512-912b-de7965202505
25,discussion4," It has been previously reported that men performing caloric restriction have lower testosterone than those consuming non-restricted Western diets [56], however, the present experiment did not restrict calories in the IF group. In animal models, IF influences the hypothalamo-hypophysial-gonadal axis and testosterone concentration probably through a decrease in leptin-mediated effects [57], but it must be considered that mice on a an every-other-day feeding regimen consume about 30–40 % less calories over time compared to free feeding animals and that in our study, no differences in leptin concentration were seen when normalized for fat mass. Also, the reduction of IGF-1 in the time restricted feeding (TRF) group deserves some discussion. A previous study by Bohulel et al. [11] reported no changes in the GH/IGF-1 during Ramadan intermittent fasting. Even though it is plausible that IF mimics caloric restriction through common pathways (e.g.",3ceac793-9b32-4c58-b75f-1d7fe7e28d3d
26,discussion5," activated protein kinase (AMPK)/ACC) (adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase/acetyl-CoA-carboxylase) [58], recent data on humans showed no influences of caloric restriction on IGF-1 [59, 60]. It is possible that the increase of adiponectin and the decrease of leptin could influence the IGF-1 concentration, even though it is unclear to what extent changes in adipokines impact circulating IGF-1 levels following weight loss [59].  Previous studies have reported mixed results concerning the ability to maintain lean body mass during IF, but the vast majority of these studies imposed calorie restriction and did not utilize exercise interventions [22]. In our study, the nutrient timing related to training session was different between the two groups, and this could affect the anabolic response of the subjects [61] even though these effects are still unclear [62].",1e25faf6-b49d-48dd-9b23-2847093fd501
27,discussion6," However, we did not find any significant differences between groups in fat-free mass, indicating that the influence of nutrient timing may be negligible when the overall content of the diet is similar.  There is an increasing amount of data suggesting that IF could potentially be a feasible nutritional scheme to combat certain diseases. In the present study, both blood glucose and insulin concentrations decreased in the IF group. The potential of IF to modulate blood glucose and insulin concentrations has previously been discussed, but primarily in the context of overweight and obese individuals [3]. The concurrent increase in adiponectin and decrease in insulin may be related to modulation of insulin sensitivity, as adiponectin concentrations have been positively correlated with insulin sensitivity [21, 50, 63, 64].",89469ce8-f979-4751-aae3-2e5e0e69b10e
28,discussion7," Moreover, related to the well-known anti-inflammatory effect of adiponectin, it is possible that the reduction of inflammatory markers is related to the improvement of insulin sensitivity. Inflammation plays an pivotal role in insulin resistance development through different cytokines that influence numerous molecular pathways. For example, insulin resistance could be triggered by TNF-α via JNK and IKKβ/NF-κB (jun amino-terminal kinase/inhibitor of NF-κβ kinase) pathways, which may increase serine/threonine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1. Moreover IL-6 could decrease insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle by inducing toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) gene expression through STAT3 (activator of transcription 3) activation. This relationship is potentially bidirectional as the activation of IKKβ/NF-κB signalling could, in turn, stimulate the production of TNF-α [65].",16f55633-b5d2-46e5-9805-bd07ff5a170a
29,discussion8," Modulation of some of these inflammatory markers by IF was seen in the present study: TNF-α and IL-1β were lower in the time restricted feeding (TRF) group than ND at the conclusion of the study, while IL-6 appeared to decrease in the time restricted feeding (TRF) group, but was not significantly different from ND. Previous information on the impact of IF on inflammatory markers is limited, but a previous investigation by Halberg et al. [66] reported no changes in TNF-α or IL-6 after two weeks of modified IF in a small sample of healthy young men.  Although a reduction in T3 was observed in the IF group, no changes in Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or resting energy expenditure were observed. The observed reduction in RR in the time restricted feeding (TRF) group indicates a very small shift towards reliance on fatty acids for fuel at rest, although a significant statistical interaction for RR was not present.",e3eac229-00f9-408c-9aa3-8228853af97f
30,discussion9," Fasting RR has been previously reported to be a predictor of substantial future weight gain in non-obese men, with individuals who have higher fasting RR being more likely to gain weight [67]. Interestingly, it was reported by Seidell et al. [67] that although RR was related to future weight gain, RMR was not. It should be noted that individuals with the highest risk of future weight gain had fasting RR > 0.85 (as compared to individuals who had RR < 0.76). In the present study, the RR at the end of the study in both the time restricted feeding (TRF) group and ND group do not directly fall into either of these categories (RR = 0.81 and 0.83, respectively).  Based on the present study, a modified IF protocol (i.e. time restricted feeding (TRF)) could be feasible for strength athletes without negatively affecting strength and muscle mass.",ec20d266-1b04-4465-affc-f406d0d475bd
31,discussion10," Interestingly, even though androgen concentrations were lowered by time restricted feeding (TRF), there was no difference in muscle mass changes between groups (+0.64 kg in time restricted feeding (TRF) vs +0.48 kg in ND). Caloric restriction in rodents has been reported to decrease testosterone and IGF-1 even though human data on long-term severe caloric restriction does not demonstrate a decrease in IGF-1 levels, but instead an increased serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) concentration [60, 68]. However, no data are available for most forms of IF. Decrease the activity of the IGF-1 axis could be a desirable target for reducing cancer risk [69], but it is also well known that the activation of the IGF-1/AKT/mTOR (insulin-like growth factor-1/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is one of the keys for muscular growth. In addition to altering IGF-1, fasting can promote autophagy [28], which is important for optimal muscle health [70].",42607935-4d34-4cdb-8a7c-6a6314c71c7f
32,discussion11," Additionally, there is a possibility that the different eating patterns of the groups in the present study impacted the relative contributions of different hypertrophic pathways in each group.  Some limitations of the present study should be taken into account. One is the different timing of meals in relationship to the training sessions that could have affected the subjects’ responses. On this point, there is not a consensus among researchers. The beneficial effects of pre-exercise essential amino acid-carbohydrate supplement have been suggested [61], but the same group found that ingesting 20 g of whey protein either before or 1 h after 10 sets of leg extension resulted in similar rates of AA uptake [62]. Additionally, other studies have reported no benefit with pre-exercise AA feeding [71, 72]. Another limitation of the present study is that the energy and macronutrient composition of the diet was based on interview, and this approach has known weaknesses.",75504dcf-ffc7-48b2-af72-800ea7427d7a
33,discussion12," Because of the limitations of this method, it is possible that differences in energy or nutrient intake between groups could have existed and played a role in the observed outcomes.  Conclusions In conclusion, our results suggest that the modified IF employed in this study: time restricted feeding (TRF) with 16 h of fasting and 8 h of feeding, could be beneficial in resistance trained individuals to improve health-related biomarkers, decrease fat mass, and at least maintain muscle mass. This kind of regimen could be adopted by athletes during maintenance phases of training in which the goal is to maintain muscle mass while reducing fat mass. Additional studies are needed to confirm our results and to investigate the long-term effects of IF and periods after IF cessation.",a84d7f57-08c8-495e-8709-fc1f96f0ae4e
