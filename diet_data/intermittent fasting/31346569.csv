0,introduction0," Classically, calorie restriction is a popular intervention for health improvement, promoting multiple functional benefits and increasing human longevity.1 - 4 However, experimental studies have reported controversial changes in cardiovascular parameters in response to calorie restriction, which was found to be associated with contractile dysfunction and myocardial morphological damage.5 - 8 Some researchers demonstrated that calorie restriction promoted ultrastructural injuries to cardiac myofibrils and changes in intracellular calcium handling; these responses were related to β-adrenergic system disorders and myocardial contractile dysfunction.5 , 7 , 9 Other morphological changes included ventricular chamber dilation, cardiomyocyte necrosis, interstitial fibrosis and mitochondrial swelling.",d4d1a23c-3af5-45d5-acd2-1538c88995ca
1,introduction1,"10 - 12  On the other hand, intermittent fasting (IF) intervention, a model of calorie restriction, was associated with few morphological changes and did not promote myocardial dysfunction after a period of 12 weeks compared to 50% calorie restriction.11 In this dietary approach, food is available ad libitum at intervals alternating with fasting periods, each lasting 12 to 24 hours.3 , 4 However, the effects of IF on the heart remain unknown. At the molecular level, the association of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mitógeno (MAPK)s), important mediators of cardiac remodeling,13 has not been studied in calorie restriction models. mitógeno (MAPK)s include three main subtypes, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Jun N terminal kinase (JNK)) and p38 kinase (p38K), which regulate the gene transcription of several messengers involved in survival, apoptosis, cell differentiation and cardiac remodeling.",d86ac6e9-7cef-4b31-9d3f-808444caecde

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of IF and exercise training on functional fitness and morphological and molecular parameters of myocardial remodeling. Our initial hypothesis is that exercise training increases functional fitness and attenuates myocardial remodeling induced by IF. ",e15e006e-b690-4737-9d29-3534cc4b88d8

Animals and Experimental Design  Male Wistar rats ( Rattus norvegicus albinus ; n=60), aged 30, obtained from the Animal Center of the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS)), Campo Grande/MS, Brazil, were used. The sample size was based on a previous study16 and considered the probability of exercise refusal and/or escape instinct during the test.20 , 21 The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control, intermittent fasting (IF), exercise training (ET) and exercise training plus intermittent fasting (exercise training plus intermittent fasting (ETI)).",c8870812-003e-4cc4-ba25-965db4c99959

After an interval of 1 min, each animal was submitted to progressive effort at an initial speed of 6 m/min, followed by increments of 3 m/min, lasting 3 min. The protocol was interrupted when the animal had reached exhaustion or when coordination between steps was difficult.21  For the evaluation of lactate levels, 25 µl of blood was collected from the animal’s tail at rest and after each exercise stage.",7c43dfb0-578a-429f-8c1f-e20c1c68f142

The anaerobic lactate threshold (LT) was determined by graphically plotting lactate concentrations during the test. The LT was determined from the time of linearity breaking as a function of load increase, obtained by visual inspection.

Metabolic Characterization  For analysis of glycemia, the animals were fasted for 8–12 hours and blood samples were collected from the caudal artery to measure glucose at baseline. Next, a 20% glucose solution (Glucose Monohydrate, Merck, São Paulo, Brazil) was administered intraperitoneally at a dosage of 2 g/kg. Blood glucose levels were then evaluated after 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes.7 , 10 Glucose was measured with an Accu-Chek Go glucose meter (Roche Diagnostic Brazil Ltda., São Paulo, Brazil).23 , 24  Nutritional Characterization  Nutritional characterization consisted of the measurement of food intake, calorie intake, and feed efficiency.

10,methods6,"  Characterization of Cardiac Morphology  To assess macroscopic morphology, the atrial and left and right ventricular weights were measured in absolute values and compared to BW and tibia length. Samples of the left ventricle were obtained through a transverse incision 6 mm from the apex. The myocardial fragments were immersed in 10% buffered formaldehyde for 48 hours. Each tissue specimen was then rinsed under running water and stored in 70% ethanol solution for more 48 hours. After the fixation step, the specimens were embedded in paraffin blocks. Histological slides were prepared from 4–7 µm thick tissue cross-sections and stained with hematoxylin/eosin and picrosirius red. For the morphometric analysis of cardiomyocytes, the cardiomyocyte area and the myocardial interstitial collagen fraction were measured as described previously.23 - 25  Hematoxylin/eosin-stained slides were used for the measurement of cardiomyocyte area.

21,discussion0," Restrictive dietary interventions are commonly used to reduce susceptibility to chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, intermittent fasting was associated with higher food and energy intake on the days the diet was offered, as well as with lower total caloric intake and lower BW measurements. Higher food intake due to intermittent fasting can be explained by changes in satiety.29 , 30  The hypothalamus is an important regulator of body homeostasis and promotes several adjustments, including satiety induction. Changes in the lateral hypothalamus result in aphagia (starvation), whereas alterations in the medial hypothalamus are associated with hyperphagia (increased appetite). As observed here, other studies11 , 29 have shown that intermittent fasting increases food intake during feeding days. Likewise, Dorighello et al.",077739a2-e85e-4c7f-9247-adb6729e4504
22,discussion1,"31 demonstrated that intermittent restriction reduced total calorie intake, in agreement with our findings. The period of exercise training did not affect food or calorie intake in the exercise training plus intermittent fasting (ETI) group. Buthani et al.,32 in a study on humans, showed that trained volunteers, even with increased hunger, did not exhibit a significant increase in food intake.  According to our initial hypothesis, exercise training on a treadmill attenuates metabolic disorders and cardiac remodeling induced by intermittent fasting. In addition to reducing energy efficiency, intermittent fasting modified glucose tolerance, which may be associated with better insulin sensitivity. The fact that insulin promotes lipogenic effects in the adipose tissue33 may explain why the groups undergoing intermittent fasting did not show significant differences in body adiposity compared to the respective controls ( Table 2 ).",d8130b98-fa15-4cb5-afce-2318824f4e85
23,discussion2," Insulin release increases in the presence of greater nutrient availability, such as during the postprandial period. Improvement in insulin sensitivity by adopting an intermittent fasting regime was also found in a recent study on mice.34  On the other hand, the combination of intermittent fasting and exercise training reduced body adiposity in the exercise training plus intermittent fasting (ETI) group. Exercise training promotes cardiorespiratory, neural and hormonal adaptations and adjustments.9 , 15 , 16 Within the endocrine context, hormone secretion is also altered by exercise. In the study by Evans et al.,35 aerobic exercise for 12 months improved insulin sensitivity, with a 19.4% decrease in the area under the oral glucose tolerance curve in older adults.",b32df5a8-6c88-42dc-ac35-8b7aa05b343d
24,discussion3," Therefore, the interaction between intermittent fasting and exercise training may have potentiated hormonal effects of insulin metabolism, as supported by the findings obtained for the ET and exercise training plus intermittent fasting (ETI) groups.  Despite glycemic effects, intermittent fasting did not alter functional fitness. Lactate measurement is one of the parameters most used to estimate aerobic capacity and has been effective to describe functional fitness.22 The lactate threshold can be defined as the exercise intensity at which the blood lactate concentration suddenly increases.21 , 22 In this respect, the running protocol improved functional fitness in the ET and exercise training plus intermittent fasting (ETI) groups, which was supported by lower final lactate values (LacE), less variation in lactate levels and higher speed and distance covered during the final test. Therefore, exercise training was associated with improved aerobic fitness, as previously demonstrated.",929dcd22-6cf9-4f19-9274-c4faaa6244df
25,discussion4,"16  Regarding cardiovascular features, exercise training promoted myocardial interstitial remodeling. Intriguingly, intermittent fasting attenuated these exercise-induced effects, as demonstrated by lower values of tissue macro- and microscopic morphometry in the exercise training plus intermittent fasting (ETI) group. Multiple factors stimulate myocardial remodeling, such as nutritional disorders, angiotensin, aldosterone, endothelin, inflammatory cytokines and catecholamines.36 Morphological and functional changes occur in response to prolonged exercise training in order to improve cardiac performance, including the blood volume pumped and oxygen supply to peripheral muscles recruited during exercise.21 , 22 These adaptive alterations induced by exercise training include left ventricular hypertrophy to compensate for hemodynamic demand and interstitial fibrosis.",c1579c83-9f37-4bf5-93d6-538513e3bb92
26,discussion5,"36 , 37 Within this context, increased interstitial collagen found in the exercise training plus intermittent fasting (ETI) group may be an indicator of the physiological ventricular remodeling process, although no myocardial hypertrophy was observed. Indeed, some factors can restrict the accuracy of microscopic morphometry, such as tissue sectioning angle and the heterogeneous contractile state of cardiac fibers.38 These factors may have contributed to the lack of detection of cardiac hypertrophy induced by exercise training.  Intermittent fasting resulted in lower values of macro and microscopic morphology, which were not associated with changes of mitógeno (MAPK) protein expression. The phenotypic changes induced by these peptides involve protein synthesis and cell growth, triggering hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, which may be associated with myocardial remodeling.",2028f754-3700-449c-906e-e4881f01c5e5
27,discussion6,"13 , 14 In addition, mitógeno (MAPK) activation is also subordinated to the action of multiple growth factors, such as growth hormone and insulin,24 , 33 whose secretion is regulated by nutritional behavior. However, it was not possible to verify association between intermittent fasting and changes in mitógeno (MAPK) protein expression. In a previous study,39 intermittent fasting attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular dilation in infarcted rats, although it did not alter the gene expression of fetal peptides.  The present findings provide evidence of cardiac remodeling induced by exercise training, which was attenuated by intermittent fasting. However, it is not possible to confirm whether the potential effect of dietary restriction is able to reverse pathological processes, such as arterial hypertension and acute myocardial infarction.",4fe2ddab-e781-45ad-a53d-d8389e668475
28,discussion7," Likewise, the impact of other experimental models, such as 25 and 50% calorie restriction,5 , 7 - 9 should be further investigated in future studies because they add limitations to the clinical outcomes of the present investigation.  Conclusion  The combination of intermittent fasting and exercise training intervention is associated with improved glucose tolerance. Exercise training alone promotes myocardial interstitial remodeling, which is attenuated by intermittent fasting.
