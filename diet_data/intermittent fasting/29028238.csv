0,introduction0,"Animals, including humans, have evolved physical adaptations to periodic long-term fasting and short-term feasting due to the scarcity of available food in the environment. Some animals become dormant during extended periods of food deprivation. While some animals hibernate during extended periods of food deprivation, a principle adaptation to fasting observed in humans is the development of energy depot organs, such as fat and the liver, to efficiently preserve energy acquired during feeding for survival. Not surprisingly, fasting has long been considered and proven to be the best intervention in metabolic disorders associated with obesity and can extend the lifespan of various organisms, from worms to mammals [1]. However, considering the periodic nature of the fasting-feeding cycle to which animals have adapted during evolution, periodic fasting (PF) or intermittent fasting (IF) have been proposed to improve metabolic health and aging [2–4].",bb86ddd4-eb4b-4a57-90f5-541241757efe
1,introduction1," In 1946, Carlson and Hoelzel first reported that IF was able to prolong the lifespan of rats [5]. Also, in 1962, Duncon et al found that IF was able to control obesity in humans [6]. An early study also indicated the beneficial effects of IF on blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, cardiovascular function, and brain function [7]. IF with complete fasting every other day extended the lifespan and increased the resistance of the brain to metabolic and excitotoxic insults [8]. Similarly, alternate-day fasting in mice led to a reduction in blood glucose levels and an increase in the resistance of neurons in the brain to excitotoxic stress, independent of total caloric intake [9]. In addition, alternate-day fasting in obese women significantly reduced body weight, fat mass, blood cholesterol concentration, and blood triglyceride concentration [10]. Time-restricted feeding (Time restricted feeding (TRF)) had a protective effect on postmenopausal obesity in mice [11].",84d307f7-d1b6-40c3-abbe-6143e432b782
2,introduction2," Time restricted feeding (TRF) was also able to attenuate metabolic disorders in mice, and most importantly, the protective effects were maintained even when Time restricted feeding (TRF) was temporarily interrupted by ad libitum access to food during weekends [12], indicating a potentially promising regimen for application in to human lifestyles. The mechanisms underpinning the apparent beneficial effects of IF were recently shown to be associated with its ability to promote browning of white adipose tissues via alterations of gut microbiota [13]. However, a recent clinical trial indicated that although alternate-day fasting reduced body weight, it did not produce superior adherence, weight loss, weight maintenance, or cardioprotection when compared to continuous daily calorie restriction in obese adults [14], indicating that future studies are still needed to provide optimal IF regimens for intervention in obesity and other related diseases.",e9b97238-987f-4cf3-b458-c1f5a6196d4f
3,introduction3,"  To promote compliance with IF in humans, Dr. Longo’s laboratory has introduced the concept of a fasting-mimicking diet (fasting mimicking diet (FMD)) to replace simple fasting [15]. fasting mimicking diet (FMD) administration for 4 days bimonthly in middle-aged mice extended longevity, lowered visceral fat and reduced cancer incidence [15]. Periodic 3-day cycles of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) were able to ameliorate demyelination and symptoms in a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model [16]. A pilot study using an fasting mimicking diet (FMD) was potentially effective in the treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients [16]. A combination of chemotherapy and an fasting mimicking diet (FMD) was also found to reduce the progression of breast cancer and melanoma by promoting T cell-mediated cytotoxicity [17].",be99f4f0-6a0d-43ce-b497-456b6874a998
4,introduction4," Recently, a human study with 100 healthy subjects demonstrated that an fasting mimicking diet (FMD) low in calories, sugar, and protein but high in unsaturated fat had beneficial effects on body mass index, blood pressure, fasting glucose, IGF-1, triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein in subjects at risk for disease compared to those in subjects who were not at risk [18]. However, one of the most remarkable studies was that of Cheng et al., who discovered that an fasting mimicking diet (FMD) was able to promote β cell generation, restore insulin secretion and recover glucose homeostasis in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes [19], thus heralding the potential of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) to reverse the pathogenesis of diabetes.  In this study, we aimed to investigate whether a new type of low-protein low-carbohydrate fasting mimicking diet (FMD) was able to intervene in type 2 diabetes in mice.",111df72d-3eea-47d3-880a-e18458767a48

32,results16," Consistently, glucose tolerance as measured by Glucose tolerance testing (GTT) was significantly improved by fasting mimicking diet (FMD) (Additional file 1: Figure S3A), while insulin tolerance testing (ITT) was slightly improved by fasting mimicking diet (FMD) (Additional file 1: Figure S3B). The area of the pancreatic islet was elevated by fasting mimicking diet (FMD) as analyzed by H&E staining (Additional file 1: Figure S3C). In addition, fluorescence staining revealed that the number of islet β cells was significantly increased by fasting mimicking diet (FMD), together with a reduction in the number of α cells (Fig. 6d). Collectively, these data indicate that intermittent administration of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) is able to intervene in the progression of T1D in the mice.Fig. 6 Intermittent fasting mimicking diet (FMD) improves hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetic mouse model.",182a8a94-9702-4491-beb7-1121e2db503d
33,results17," a Experimental scheme to determine effects of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) in T1D in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice. Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to two groups: control and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) (n = 6 for control and n = 7 for fasting mimicking diet (FMD)). streptozotocin (STZ) (40 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally for five consecutive days. An equal volume of citrate buffer was injected into control mice. Each fasting mimicking diet (FMD) cycle entails 7 days of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) and 7 days of ad libitum feeding (AL). During AL period, the mice had free access to normal chow. b Body weight. c Blood glucose levels. Blood samples were collected on the last day of each cycle. Mice were fasted for 6 h (morning fasting) before glucose measurements. d Immunostaining of pancreatic sections to detect expression of insulin and glucagon. Scale bar: 20 μm.

34,discussion0,"Our study is in agreement with numerous previous studies demonstrating that IF is a beneficial intervention in diabetes. IF has been found to improve glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in heterozygous BDNF knockout mice and was associated with reduction of obesity and an increase in locomotor activity [22]. IF was able to significantly improve glucose homeostasis in sand rats [23] and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [24]. High fat diet (High fat diet (HFD))-fed mice experiencing Time restricted feeding (TRF) consumed the same number of calories as the control groups, but Time restricted feeding (TRF) provided protection against obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation together with improved motor coordination [25].  The beneficial effects of IF on health was originally proposed to be achieved by two mechanisms: reduction in oxidative damage and increase in cellular stress resistance [26].",287a91e4-4035-45d7-b571-c3aa0d8636ec
35,discussion1," IF was able to reduce mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), indicating a beneficial antioxidant effect that could reduce oxidative stress associated with aging [27]. In addition, Time restricted feeding (TRF) in mice is associated with improvements in the function of CREB, mTOR and AMPK pathways, which are closely linked to metabolic homeostasis of the body [28]. IF is also associated with a reduction in inflammation, as it has been found that reduction in dietary energy intake differentially modulates neurotrophic and inflammatory pathways to protect neurons against ischemic injury [29]. Lately, autophagy has been shown to be crucial in mediating the beneficial effects on IF on diabetes. Under the condition of High fat diet (HFD), IF restores autophagic flux in islets and improves glucose tolerance via increasing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, β cell survival, and nuclear expression of pancreatic regeneration marker Ngn3 [30].",73b0af51-836c-49b7-9f4f-89ecae406807
36,discussion2,"  Many recent studies have indicated that gut microbiota are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes [31–33]. We observed that the composition of gut microbiota was markedly altered by the fasting mimicking diet (FMD). Intermittent application of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) significantly increased the bacteria Parabacteroides distasonis and Blautia, and these bacteria were associated with lower blood glucose levels. On the other hand, the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) decreased the levels of Prevotellaceae UCG-001, Alistipes and Ruminococcaceae UCG-01, and these bacteria were associated with higher blood glucose levels. The changes in the bacteria found in our study are consistent with the observations reported by other groups. In particular, the gut bacteria Parabacteroides distasonis was found to mediate the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet in improving insulin sensitivity in obese human subjects [34].",1799c4ae-010d-4ce7-8864-67782f43a430
37,discussion3," Prevotellaceae was increased in the gut microbiota of T2D patients [35]. In ob/ob mice, Prevotellaceae was associated with impaired glucose tolerance, while Lachnospiraceae was correlated with improvements in glucose tolerance [36]. In addition, Blautia, which was increased by the fasting mimicking diet (FMD), was found to be elevated after treatment with berberine and metformin in diabetic rats [37]. Considering the contribution of gut microbiota to the development of diabetes, it is important to investigate how alterations in the gut microbiome mediate the interventional effect of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) on type 2 diabetes in the future.  Our study has provided further evidence indicating that IF is able to preserve or restore β cell function, as suggested by a recent study from Dr. Longo’s group [19], in which it was found that Ngn3-driven β cell regeneration occurred after fasting mimicking diet (FMD) application in diabetic mice.",91511c86-bd4c-49ad-bc61-2fe6fb299fe1
38,discussion4," As continuous fasting has not been reported to aid in the regeneration of β cells in db/db mice, we propose that the pattern of intermittent fasting is key to restoring β cell function. One of the unanswered question concerns identification of the best regime of intermittent fasting. Cheng’s study used a 4-day fasting mimicking diet (FMD), alternating with 7 days of free feeding in db/db mice [19]. Our study used a 7-day fasting mimicking diet (FMD) alternating with 7 days of free eating. Another difference between our fasting mimicking diet (FMD) administration and that in Cheng’s study is the energy intake. In Cheng’s study, the mice took the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) for 4 days followed by al libitum standard chow for up to 10 days [19]. When using the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) in their study, the mice were fed 50% of the normal caloric intake on day 1 and 10% caloric intake on days 2–4 [19].",a843c2cb-d61a-4d61-9389-e17aed9d3c95
39,discussion5," In our study, the mice were given ~ 1/3 of the caloric intake each day for 7 days, followed by al libitum standard chow for 7 days. It is important to find the optimal fasting period interval as well as the optimal caloric restriction in the future. Another unanswered question concerns the degree to which the protective effect of an intermittent fasting mimicking diet (FMD) is due to the reduction in obesity of the mice, as numerous previous studies in both animals and humans have indicated that the reduction in obesity is closely associated with the amelioration of diabetes. Interestingly, in our study, body weight fluctuated with the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) regime (Fig. 1c). Even at the points in which the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) mice regained body weight at a level similar to that of the control mice, blood glucose levels were still lower in the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) group (Fig. 1c).",e7ed5770-b01d-42e2-8973-1b425582c29c
40,discussion6," Such an observation favors the idea that the reduction in obesity cannot completely explain the protective effect of intermittent fasting on diabetes. We therefore propose that the improvement of β cell function in diabetic mice is mainly due to intermittent fasting mimicking diet (FMD) rather than body weight loss.  It is worth noting that the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) used in this study is mainly plant-based and contains hundreds of ingredients and many of them have bioactivities. At present we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the observed beneficial effects of fasting mimicking diet (FMD) administration are caused by the bioactive molecules of the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) in addition to intermittent fasting. Nevertheless, our study provides strong evidence to support that the intermittent administration of an fasting mimicking diet (FMD) is an effective interventional strategy in diabetic mice, paving the way for future studies in humans.",3e951699-51b6-45e6-be86-3bac6aadcc16
