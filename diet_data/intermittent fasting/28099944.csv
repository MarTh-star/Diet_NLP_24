0,methods0,"2.1. Animals One hundred, 8-week old C57BL/6 mice (Avg. Wt: 22.2 ± 2.5 g Males, 17.6 ± 1.7 g Females) were acquired from the Animal Resource Centre (Murdoch, WA, Australia) and housed at the animal holding facility at Werribee campus, Victoria University. Mice were housed in groups of 5 at a constant temperature (22 °C), under a 12:12-h light-dark photoperiod with ad libitum access to food and water (other than fasting periods) in accordance with ethical approval obtained from the Victoria University Animal Ethics Committee, conforming to the Australian code of practice for the care and use of animal for scientific purposes. All animals were fed a high fat (HF) (59% energy from fat, SF03-002, Speciality Feeds, Glen Forrest, WA, Australia) and high sugar (S) water (30% sugar w/v) diet for a period of 24-weeks. The initial 12-weeks of HF/S feeding was designed to induce obesity within the mice according to protocol used by La Fleur [17].",0537e74b-c312-4b5d-8905-ff173594ba8e
1,methods1,"  One group of mice was killed after 12-weeks of HF/S feeding (Males = 8, Females = 10) to establish baseline measures for some variables to compare to the remaining groups. The remaining mice were randomly allocated using block randomisation (both allocator and executer blinded to the blocks) into 4 groups: no intervention (control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON); Males = 7, Females = 9); intermittent fasting (IF; Males = 8, Females = 10), high intensity interval training (high intensity interval training (HIIT); Males = 8, Females = 10) and a combination of the dietary and exercise intervention (IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT); Males = 8, Females = 10) (Figure 1). These groups continued the HF/S feeding for another 12-weeks and after a total of 24-weeks of HF/S feeding and intervention, mice were sacrificed and tested as described below.",a56dfd59-dd89-4eee-b1cf-81cf77e5327c
2,methods2," To minimise any acute transient effects from either fasting and exercise treatment [18], a period of 48 h was given between the last fasting period and exercise session and any physiological measurement or sample collection for all animals. Eleven male mice died during the study intervention period. Of the 11 that died, 6 died during the HF/S dietary intervention period and before group allocation; 2 died from the IF group; 2 died from the HITT group; and 1 died from the combined dietary and exercise group. All mice underwent necropsy by the animal house technical staff with no obvious cause of death. Furthermore, these deaths were also reported to the animal ethics committee of University and cleared of any negligence on the researcher’s behalf and the experimental design of the study. One female mouse did not gain weight in the control group and was excluded from the analysis. All groups had ad libitum access to the HF/S diet. All intervention groups underwent an 8-day cycle.",22fa8c0b-4596-435f-bff3-e30d90e3fc55
3,methods3," This was designed to give at least one-day break between fasting days and exercise days for combination (IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT)) group and ensure animal wellbeing. To ensure uniformity between the groups, IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) groups underwent the same 8-day cycle. However, the total period of interventions was restricted to 12 calendar weeks.  2.2. Intermittent Fasting Protocol Mice from IF and IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT) group were deprived of food on two alternate days of an eight-day cycle for 12-weeks. During the fasting period, mice were moved to clean cages with potable water available ad libitum and returned to their original cages 24 h later. On non-fasting days, mice had ad libitum access to the HF/S diet [19,20]. Mice were always fasted on day 2 and 7 of the 8-day cycle.  2.3.",c5c5260f-9969-48d8-9a82-c41a5108676e
4,methods4," Top Speed Test and High Intensity Interval Training Protocol All groups were acclimatized to treadmill running through five gradual treadmill training familiarization sessions over a period of 2-weeks prior to intervention commencement according to standard operating procedures for treadmill exercise and university animal ethics guidelines. The protocol for top speed determination was as follows: mice performed an incremental warm up period for 5 min reaching 8 cm/s. The speed was slowly increased from 8 to 35 cm/s and was held at 35 cm/s for 20 s, and then returned back to 8 cm/s for 40 s. Following this, the speed was slowly increased to 40 cm/s and maintained for 20 s followed by another 40 s of active rest at 8 cm/s. The 20 s running, and 40 s active rest protocol was repeated with increasing running speed by 5 cm/s until the mouse was unable to continue running. The running speed prior to this was recorded as the top speed. The average top speed for all mice was 59 ± 2 cm/s.",b2c1d3e9-65ec-4289-b4f8-f56d8a3edbd6
5,methods5," To minimise the effects of the training adaptation during the familiarisation sessions, all mice, irrespective of their group, underwent the 2-weeks familiarisation training.  The high intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol chosen was a slightly modified protocol used by Tuazon, et al. [21] with the relatively low volume and high intensity shown to have positive effects on body composition and metabolic health [22]. Briefly, the high intensity interval training (HIIT) training sessions consisted of a 5 min warm up period at 8 cm/s, followed by 6–8, 20 s bouts of treadmill running at the previously determined top speed of the individual animal, interspersed by 40 s active rest at 8 cm/s. The slope of treadmill was maintained at 0°. To implement overload, the number of intervals was increased from 6 at the beginning of the training intervention to 8 at the end of the eighth high intensity interval training (HIIT) session.",74acddcf-2bbc-4f7f-945e-ae97f9023931
6,methods6," high intensity interval training (HIIT) was performed on three non-consecutive days per 8-day cycle. To encourage the mice to run on the treadmill at their maximum speed, an air puff device was used if the mice appeared to slow down.  2.4. Body Weight and Composition Assessment Body weight was measured weekly on laboratory weighing balance. Body composition (adipose and lean mass) was determined using EchoMRI (EchoMRI- body composition analyser, Houston, TX, USA) before and after 10-weeks of diet and/or exercise intervention.  2.5. Assessment of Fasting Blood Glucose and Glucose Tolerance (and Glucose Tolerance (AUC)) Fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance was analysed before and after 10-weeks of diet and/or exercise intervention. Fasting glucose was measured using handheld glucometer (Accu-Check GO glucometer, Roche Diabetes Care, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) from blood collected by snipping the tail tip (1–2 mm) following an overnight (12 h) fast and between the hours of 7 a.m.",6fa597b7-7f0f-4022-b629-5d3c8e4f457f
7,methods7,"–9 a.m. Mice were given intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1.5 g/kg body weight) and blood was collected from the tail before and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min following the glucose administration. Glucose tolerance was calculated as glucose area under the curve (and Glucose Tolerance (AUC)) using trapezoidal method [23].  2.6. Assessment of Plasma Insulin, Glucose and Triacylglycerol (Triacylglycerol (TAG)), Low-Density Lipoprotein (low density lipoproteins (LDL)) and High-Density Lipoprotein (High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)) Levels Plasma insulin, glucose, Triacylglycerol (TAG), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) were measured after 12-weeks of diet and/or exercise intervention. Following 12 h fasting, mice were anaesthetised with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg). A total of 48 h was given between the final exercise session or IF period and culling day.",81a78181-9d68-4ab3-95f0-89aa56f222d9
8,methods8," Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and plasma was prepared using EDTA as anticoagulant and centrifugation at 2000× g for 15 min. Plasma glucose was determined by handheld glucometer (Abbott Freestyle Optium, Abbott Diabetes Care, Ltd., Oxfordshire, UK). Plasma insulin, low density lipoproteins (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) was analysed using commercially available kits (Crystal Chem, Inc., Downers Grove, IL, USA). Plasma Triacylglycerol (TAG) was analysed using commercially available kits (ABCAM, Cambridge, MA, USA).  2.7. Assessment of Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined by using the following formula: fasting plasma insulin (mU/L) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5 [9].  2.8. Assessment of Muscle Strength Muscle strength was measured before and after 10-weeks of diet and/or exercise intervention using a grip strength test as previously described by Deacon [24].",39551fc0-443f-4000-ae07-b137b420d923
9,methods9," Briefly, a grip test apparatus was used which consisted of a of stainless steel wire ball connected to a series of steel chain links, varying from one (15 g) to six (74 g). Mice were held by the base of their tail and allowed to grasp the grip test apparatus lying on a lab bench with its forepaws. Mice were lifted until the apparatus was raised from the bench. Holding the apparatus at a specific weight for 3 s was deemed a successful lift and the mice would proceed to next heavier weight. If the mice failed to achieve the 3 s target for 5 consecutive times, the trial was stopped, and mouse was assigned the weight/time achieved. A 30 s rest between lifts was used. The final score (absolute muscle strength) was calculated by the number of links (1 to 6) in the last heaviest weight held for 3 s multiplied by time i.e., 3, plus the number of seconds last heaviest weight was held for less than 3 s.",b4f29434-ee2b-4907-9707-68667412663c
10,methods10," The total score was divided by the respective lean mass to calculate relative muscle strength. This method was adopted to measure the changes in muscle strength rather than the inverted screen test often used for testing grip strength, which is affected by total body weight.  2.9. Assessment of Caloric Intake Food and sugar water intake of animals from each cage was measured weekly and average caloric intake per animal per day was calculated. Due to housing constrains of ethical approval and to avoid added stress, animals from the control and high intensity interval training (HIIT) groups were housed together and animals from IF and IF+high intensity interval training (HIIT) groups were housed together.",f13369b8-774e-4de4-b75c-ffe608ed3c64
11,methods11," The average caloric intake from the intervention control + high intensity interval training (HIIT) animal (“non-fasting” group) was compared to IF + IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT) animals (“fasting” group) to determine if intermittent fasting resulted in over compensation of food intake on non-fasting days over the 12-weeks intervention period.  2.10. Statistical Analysis Data is presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Delta changes (pre- and post-intervention) in body weight and body composition (fat mass and lean mass), fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance and muscle strength were analysed using 4 (control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON), IF, high intensity interval training (HIIT), IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT)) × 2 (0 and 10-weeks) repeated measures ANOVA. Tukey’s test was used to analyse any significant interaction effects.",ca7ac45b-b822-4425-8756-0c948dc49249
12,methods12," Since baseline measurements of plasma insulin, glucose and low density lipoproteins (LDL), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Triacylglycerol (TAG) levels were not taken for each intervention group, analysis of delta changes for plasma insulin, HOMA-IR and lipid panels were performed using the mean average of group 1 (HF/S ‘obese’ control values) as the “baseline” minus the post-intervention values of the respective intervention groups. These delta values were analysed using 4 (control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON), IF, high intensity interval training (HIIT), IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT)) × 2 (0 and 12-weeks) repeated measures ANOVA. One way ANOVA was also performed on plasma insulin, HOMA-IR and lipid panels at 12-weeks. Baseline variables and average caloric intake between groups was analysed using an independent students’ t-test. Sample size was calculated using G Power software.",bb160521-1579-4cef-b592-d4ccbf146bb1
13,methods13," Based on the difference in weight gain between control HFD and alternative day fasting + HFD groups [25], the calculated effect size was 7.9. With alpha of 0.05, a sample size of 8 per group would yield a power of 0.95. A 5–10% loss was incorporated to give group size of 9. An alpha level of 0.05 was adopted throughout to reduce Type I statistical errors.  3. Results 3.1. Effects of 12-Weeks of the HF/S Diet on Body Weight of All Animals A significant increase in body weight was observed in male and female mice following the initial 12-weeks of consumption of the HF/S diet (Male = Baseline: 22.2 ± 2.5 g, 12-week: 36.2 ± 2.1 g (~63%↑); Female = Baseline: 17.6 ± 1.7 g, 12-week: 28.5 ± 1.5 g (~62%↑)).  3.2.",fd0eb895-4120-4833-99cf-0d96f641f0bc

In the female mice, absolute muscle strength was decreased in the IF group over the 10-week period (p < 0.05). Similarly, when muscle strength was expressed per lean mass, relative muscle strength also declined over the 10-week period in IF females group only. No other significant differences were observed for absolute muscle strength or relative muscle strength (Table 3).  4. Discussion Intermittent fasting with or without high intensity interval training resulted in significantly less weight gain in male mice despite concurrently consuming a high fat and sugar diet.",a5d740dd-2fe5-4f61-a377-287c0f2f1d30
22,methods22," The reduced weight gain was predominantly in the form of lower fat mass accumulation, with no loss in lean mass. At the end of the diet and/or exercise intervention period, low density lipoproteins (LDL) levels were significantly lower in the male IF and IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT) groups compared to controls, whereas female mice demonstrated significantly lower Triacylglycerol (TAG) levels in the IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT) group compared to high intensity interval training (HIIT) group. Interestingly, intermittent fasting appeared to have a negative impact on markers of glycaemic control, especially within the female mice, with significant elevations in fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance and HOMA-IR observed at the end of the intervention period.",e24c51c4-da64-45b0-a63b-0509342c19d9
23,methods23," The changes in body composition, glycaemic control and lipid panels seem to be gender specific with male mice demonstrating greater changes in most variables compared to the female mice, independent of the intervention.  Following an initial 12-weeks of HF/S feeding to induce obesity, a further 10-weeks of HF/S diet caused a significant increase in body mass and fat mass by ~16% and ~47%, respectively in control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON) male mice and by ~19% and ~46%, respectively in control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON) female mice. These changes are comparable to those reported elsewhere using a similar diet [26,27]. Combining IF for 2 days per week with high intensity interval training (HIIT) for 3 days per week produced the most effective changes in body weight and fat mass compared to either IF or high intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention alone.",e87cb467-545c-4292-821c-20f4ebbd518d
24,methods24," The IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT) group weighed ~9 g and ~6 g less and displayed ~66% and 24% lower fat mass in the males and females, respectively, compared to the control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON) mice. The reduced weight gain and fat accumulation was also greater compared to the high intensity interval training (HIIT) and IF groups; although not significantly different between the male IF groups. The body compositional changes observed in the combined diet and exercise group supports the primary hypothesis of the study and provides evidence of an additive affect when implemented concurrently. Studies using combined CR with exercise have also reported reduced weight gain in comparison to control animals (no diet and exercise) [28,29].",22715e75-bb7d-4758-8795-08aa3b718692
25,methods25," Huffman and colleagues [29] administered 24-weeks of CR (18% restriction of high fat diet) combined with five days per week of treadmill running at speeds approximately 13–15 m/min resulted in weight gain prevention (~15 g) and fat mass reductions (~45%) compared to CR only. Similar weight gain prevention (~15 g) was also observed following 30% CR combined with voluntary wheel running (distance not measured) for 8-weeks [28]. These changes, especially in weight, were greater than the body compositional changes observed in the current study and are likely due to a larger energy deficiency created by the greater energy restriction and/or higher exercise-induced energy expenditure of the protocols used [28,29].  The intermittent fasting intervention also resulted in significantly less weight gain (~18% or ~7.3 g) and fat mass accumulation (~58% or ~6.9 g) compared to control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON) group; albeit only in male mice.",f49fd28f-ffb5-4e36-b829-5a7d4c03a8b1
26,methods26," Previous studies using ADF regimes have also shown improvements in body composition, with reduced gains in body mass over a 4- to 6-week period compared to mice consuming a standard chow diet [22,30]. Using a similar model of diet-induced obesity to that of the current study, 4-weeks of ADF led to lower body mass and fat mass gains by approximately 13% and 50%, respectively, compared to high fat fed controls [26]. Similarly, Higashida and colleagues [25] also showed significantly less weight gain (~27%) and intra-abdominal fat accumulation (~39%) following 6-weeks of ADF compared to the high fat fed controls in rats [25]. The greater difference in reduced weight gain reported in the Higashida et al. [25] study versus the present study (~27% vs. ~16%) could be due to the frequency of fasting days, as the Higashida et al. [25] implemented their 21 days of fasting within a 6-week period, whereas the current study implemented 24 days of fasting within a 10-week period.",c49d8a5a-e858-4eed-8ba3-22d382276afb
27,methods27," Indeed, Joslin and colleagues [18] demonstrated greater changes in body composition, in fact, weight loss, following 35 fasting days within a 10-week ADF protocol. Notwithstanding, it is evident from the current study and others that IF is an effective method of reducing body weight and fat mass in mice consuming either standard chow or a high fat and sugar diet. The results are most likely a reflection of the substantial physiological and biochemical changes created by the negative energy balance following fasting periods.  It should be highlighted that despite the intermittent fasting group with or without exercise demonstrating reduced weight gain compared to HF/S diet group only, only modest changes in weight occurred within each group.",ce1eee80-958d-449a-a592-8e2a9aca1807
28,methods28," This could be explained by the recent findings of the MATADOR study which demonstrated greater weight loss efficiency when intermittent energy restriction was interrupted with periods of energy balance ‘rest periods’ to potentially reduce any compensatory metabolic responses that can occur to return the body to its original weight [31]. Whether such compensatory mechanisms explain the modest weight changes observed in the current study requires further investigation.  Another strategy to create a negative energy balance is to increase energy expenditure greater than energy intake [32]. In the current study, mice completing 10-weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT), 3 times a week displayed less body mass and fat mass by approximately 5% and 8% and 6% and 10% in male and female mice, respectively compared to control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON) mice.",863c2db4-ec3c-4faa-a1f7-e64e783c2bb8
29,methods29," Greater changes in weight and fat mass have been observed in other studies with up to 16% and 45% prevention in weight and fat gain, respectively [22,33]. However, such differences are most likely due to the training volume, with other studies undertaking 10–12 bouts of high intensity interval training (HIIT), five days a week for 8 to 10-weeks [22,33] compared to the present study of eight bouts, three days per week. Furthermore, the high intensity interval training (HIIT) group in the present study concurrently consumed a diet high in fat and sugar during the intervention period and thus, any change in appetite (i.e., increase) because of the exercise training would have resulted in increased consumption. Consuming a standard chow diet may have attenuated weight gain or perhaps led to weight loss.  Glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and elevated Triacylglycerol (TAG) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) levels have been noted in animal models of diet-induced obesity [22,26,34].",3920ed7a-5e2c-4084-90ac-e98d2a21e478
30,methods30," In the current study, high fat feeding resulted in hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in both male and female ‘Obese’ baseline control mice, with elevated glucose levels indicating diabetes onset. Despite previous studies demonstrating improved glycaemic control and reduced diabetes risk following even modest weight reduction [26,33], the present study was unable to confirm such findings following the diet and/or exercise interventions. Lower low density lipoproteins (LDL) and Triacylglycerol (TAG) levels following the combined interventions in both males and female mice, respectively, compared to controls was observed at the end of the intervention period. The effect of IF on glucose metabolism and glycaemic control was unexpected. Both male and female IF groups exhibited significant increases in fasting glucose and plasma insulin and glucose tolerance and insulin resistance at either 10- or 12-weeks.",ed9a4825-4114-4317-8954-9c4b6effe72e
31,methods31," Although these results are contradictory to the commonly reported view that IF lowers fasting blood glucose levels and improves glycaemic control [6], it has been reported that long term (32-weeks) of IF, but not CR, can lead to redox imbalances, insulin receptor nitration, and thus glucose intolerance in rats [35]. Reduced glucose tolerance is usually a result of lower insulin release [36], however, in the current study, insulin levels were significantly higher than the ‘obese’ controls at the end of the intervention period. It is difficult to make comparisons to other animal and human IF studies since the mice in the current study concurrently consumed a HF/S diet, rather than a typical standard chow or ‘healthy’ diet often prescribed in animal and human studies, respectively [37,38]. A study by Joslin et al., [18] did report improved glucose tolerance and lower circulating insulin levels following ADF with concurrent HF feeding. The improvements observed in the Joslin et al.",29cd3e24-38ae-4301-b6ed-6cbcc20552cb
32,methods32," study could be due to the greater weight loss reported (~16 g) compared to the current study (1.14 g), with evidence suggesting the amount of weight loss may drive the benefits in glucose handling in obesity [39].  Finally, the attrition rate reported in the current study was unforeseen. All mice underwent necropsy by the animal house technical staff with no obvious cause of death. This strain of mice (C57BL6) are a well-established model for investigating diet-induced obesity and type II diabetes. There is some evidence to suggest that male mice are more prone to the adverse effects of HFD, and that dietary and so-far-unidentified environmental factors can combine to induce obesity and diabetes of variable severity [40]. Whether this susceptibility contributed to the death of some of the male mice is unknown.",f1b2f00b-837b-447c-a87e-ebd10ba48885
33,methods33," Furthermore, given the quality of reporting in animal research, especially in regards to attrition rates, has been quite poor [41], it is difficult to compare our attrition rate to others of similar design.  5. Conclusions Current evidence suggests that as little as 10 min of high intensity exercise can improve metabolic health and aerobic capacity [42] and alternative day fasting can reduce obesity-associated changes in body composition, fasting insulin and glucose concentrations [43,44]. The current study wanted to confirm the aforementioned findings by mimicking similar protocols in animal models. Secondly, to investigate the combined effects of such regimes and its long-term impact, and thirdly, unlike human studies which typically don’t change the research participant’s diet, we wanted to observe the effects of these diet and exercise regimes while concurrently consuming a high fat and sugar diet.",9cb7c0b8-3de1-49e6-86dd-181f09d261dc
34,methods34," The present study is the first study to demonstrate superior effects on body composition and lipid profiles following combined IF and high intensity interval training (HIIT) compared to either diet or exercise intervention alone while concurrently consuming a high fat and sugar diet. These observations are likely due to the physiological and biochemical changes that occur when creating a negative energy balance shift. An observation of interest was the gender specific responses to the same diet and/or exercise intervention and could indicate potential hormonal differences influencing metabolic control/adaptation in mice. The results of the present study suggest that the combination of diet and exercise are most effective at attenuating the negative impact that high fat and sugar diet has on body weight, composition and lipid levels.  6. Limitations A number of limitations exist in the current study.",02429e12-eabb-405c-a7b8-2d015de6f121
35,methods35," Firstly, due to limitations in obtaining adequate blood from the tail of the mice, only blood glucose and and Glucose Tolerance (AUC) were measured before and after 10-weeks of diet and/or exercise intervention. Plasma insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR and lipid panels were only measured at the end of the 12-week intervention period and subsequently compared to the average ‘obese’ baseline controls rather than the true baseline (0-week) for each individual intervention group to analyse changes over time. Given starting weights for all intervention groups and the ‘obese’ baseline group were not significantly different, we can only speculate that the hormonal and lipid levels would be similar.",0855463f-b588-4def-a212-6eab4ac034e6
36,methods36," Secondly, due to housing constrains of ethical approval, mice from different intervention groups were housed together, more specifically, mice undergoing fasting (IF and IF + high intensity interval training (HIIT)) were housed together and mice undergoing no fasting (high intensity interval training (HIIT) and control (OBC) (2) no intervention (CON)) were housed together. Thus, food intake of individual mice could not be attained. ",6acf4a97-0ce8-4d4a-90ab-e5648ef5e01e
