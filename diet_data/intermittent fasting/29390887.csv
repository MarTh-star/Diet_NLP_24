0,background0,"Aging is a biological process modulated by both genetic architecture passed down from parents and environmental factors the animal experiences throughout their lives [1–3]. To date, a wide array of anti-aging interventions has been proposed to extend healthy lifespan and enhance the health status, e.g. dietary restriction (DR), exercise, pharmacological interventions, and hormesis [4, 5]. Among these, dietary restriction, defined as reducing food intake without malnutrition, is the first and most reproducible intervention supported by a large body of empirical studies in the last few decades [6–8]. The concept of DR has been expanded from initial calorie restriction to a wide range of diet-related intervention including short-term starvation, intermittent fasting, and macronutrient (i.e. necessary amino acid, proteins, carbohydrates) restriction [6].",3dc34431-8acc-4b3e-bc94-f80aee581c78
1,background1,"  Intermittent fasting (IF) has drawn great attention recently and was proposed as an alternative to traditional dietary restriction [6, 8–10]. During intermittent fasting, animals are periodically exposed to fasting during which the food is withdrawn. IF differs from DR in that it does not limit the amount of food available. Instead, the animals are offered food ad libitum at scheduled feeding periods [10, 11]. DR and IF are both reported to be beneficial for model organisms and for humans—the most direct and obvious one being the promotion of weight loss [12, 13]. In addition, they also generate many physiological benefits, including enhancing glucose tolerance [14], decreasing heart rate and blood pressure [15, 16], and reducing oxidative damage [10], which results in the extension of a healthy lifespan and a lower incidence of aging-associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease and kidney disease [10, 17–19].",6e4349eb-10c0-400f-a3cc-06b18dee3ce7
2,background2," DR seems intuitively more challenging than IF to implement for experimental animals; the latter is thus gaining increasing popularity and requires further investigation as a potential protocol for delaying aging and enhancing healthy lifespan.  While it is quite obvious that dietary interventions have several health benefits for animals, their effects on lifespan demonstrated in previous studies are not always consistent [20]. In some long-lived animals such as mice, IF (alternative day fasting) beginning at the age of 1–2 months increased adult lifespan [21]. Similar results were also observed for short-lived rotifers with an average lifespan of 2 weeks [22]. However, some previous studies on IF showed contradicting results. A well-controlled investigation with fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) showed no positive effects of IF [23]. But a most recent paper showed that IF can benefit fruit fly with longevity extension [24].",b912f417-a23a-499e-81e7-a37c97921e2e
3,background3," Additionally, in one study with short-lived fish, IF even significantly shortened the longevity in comparison with ad libitum fed controls [25]. This disparity in the effects of IF on lifespan for different taxa might be due to their differences in reproductive modes, which have rarely been addressed in most studies.  Although the effects of these dietary interventions on aging and lifespan have been explored extensively across a diverse range of animal taxa, ranging from invertebrates (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans) to vertebrates (e.g., Rattus rattus, Mus musculus, and Macaca mulatta) [26], the underlying mechanism by which dietary restriction modulates aging process has yet to be understood [2].",32fd683f-0917-4855-9159-185b899cfe73
4,background4," Given that an increased longevity in response to dietary restriction has been witnessed to be coupled with a decrease in fecundity in laboratory animals, this phenomenon appears to indicate that a trade-off between reproduction and survival is the driving force of longer lifespan, which played a crucial role in theory and interpretation of the life history studies [27]. The most prominent theory is the disposable soma theory, which suggests that these two fitness components share a finite resource pool, thus an increased investment in reproduction would withdraw resources that might otherwise be available for somatic maintenance [28–30]. Because previous research on aging mainly focused on longevity, few experimental studies have investigated the influence of dietary restriction on reproduction. As a result, more empirical support for the trade-off theory is still needed.",be724ae2-3459-4ed4-b611-9085af2e2a28
5,background5," Moreover, the limited existing evidence is mainly demonstrated in model organisms including fruit fly, worm, and mice, which showed a more remarkable response to dietary restriction than non-model organisms [31]. Therefore, further investigations that explore the impact of the dietary restriction on both longevity and reproduction are needed, particularly in other non-model species.  It has recently been noticed that males and females are not only different in aging rates and lifespan within species, but also display distinct responses to a variety of anti-aging interventions [32, 33]. In many studies, DR has weaker effects on males than on females, both in the model and non-model species [31]. Moreover, there is a sex-specific optimal food regime for lifespan extension. For example, in the D.",b7dc3fe1-56fb-4209-92c2-125f7f236cc6
6,background6," melanogaster, the females have a longer lifespan on average than the males, and their longevity reached a plateau at a food concentration of 60% of the standard laboratory diet compared with a concentration of 40% for males [34]. One possible reason is that males generally invest less in reproduction, and they consequently need comparatively little resource for somatic maintenance and reproduction. However, there is relatively little information about how dietary regimes influencing lifespan of males differently from females.  In this study, we investigated the influence of IF on lifespan and reproduction in a non-model species: a spider mite (Tetranychus urticae),which belongs to the Acari (mite) family Tetranychidae It exhibits cosmopolitanism and has a wide range of host species, including beans, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, corn, cannabis, and strawberries, with beans being one of its preferred host plants.",b657f858-d318-422d-86f4-13d2cd98d709
7,background7," At 25 °C, the spider mites usually develop from egg to adult in about ten days, and the adults live for around two weeks with lifetime fecundity ranging from 50 eggs to 178 eggs [35]. Although there are extensive documents on the life history traits of female spider mites, the male has been largely ignored. We included both males and females as subjects, aiming to examine the sex difference in aging by exposing them to three treatments of IF with controls fed ad libitum. Our previous study found that bigger females have higher starvation resistance than small males [36]. Therefore, we expected that the effects of IF would be level and sex dependent, and the longevity and reproduction of males and females would differ across the treatments. Furthermore, we predicted that the long-lived female would show a lower lifetime fecundity as predicted by the life history trade-off model. Specifically, there would be a negative correlation between female longevity and lifetime reproduction.",24ecbe92-8ca4-4607-9d9a-d719195c5545

According to this result, we deduced that 2 days fasting is the maximum both females and males can tolerate without extremely deleterious effects. Therefore, the spider mites were exposed to three treatments of IF, i.e. 33% IF, 50% IF, and 67% IF by feeding them 2 days out of every 3 consecutive days (feed-feed-starved; abbreviated as 33% IF hereafter), 2 days out of every 4 days (feed-feed-starved-starved, 50% IF), and 1 day every 3 days (feed-starved-starved, 67% IF), with spider mites feed at ad libitum as control. They were transferred to a rearing arena with a black plastic sheet as a substrate during starvation, while placed on fresh leaf discs as a substrate during the feeding period.

The experiment started with males and females on the first day of the final molt. To prepare a large population of mites at this age, the unmated females and mated females from the lab population were transferred to leaf discs to lay eggs for 24 h, and these eggs of the same age were then collected and allowed to hatch and develop into adults of similar ages. In all treatments, males and females were paired and fed during the first 2 days of adulthood. They underwent the first starvation period on the third day after the adult emergency when most females started to produce eggs. The mites were then exposed to the four dietary regimes: ad libitum, 33% IF, 50% IF, 67% IF, as mentioned above.",304691d7-e194-4af5-818f-cd0719b4a9ef

23,discussion1,"  Sex difference in lifespan and response to IF The males and females demonstrated a sex-specific response to different treatments of IF. With the increased level of fasting, females first showed extended lifespan at 50% IF than the controls (ad libitum feeding), but as fasting regimes (67% IF) levelled, their lifespan shortened. However, the fasting males exhibited shorter lifespan compared with the control and lifespan were further shortened with increasing level of fasting. This is the first report demonstrating a sex difference in response to IF, as the majority of existing research investigating the effects of IF have ignored the potential sex-specific response.  One possible explanation for the sex-specific response to IF is their differences in nutrient reserve and resource allocation. On the one hand, the females are able to store much more nutrients and energy, and thus compensate for the food shortage better during fasting periods.",978439ad-48fb-4310-90aa-2f44820d71b9
24,discussion2," This is supported by the fact that females are more resilient to starvation when food is deprived without further food replenishment, as shown in our previous study and some other research [35, 39, 40]. On the other hand, from the daily observation of female fecundity, it was clearly shown that when there was no access to food, females could reduce reproduction on the first day and even stop reproduction on the following fasting day. This may indicate that the females can divert the limited resource from reproduction to somatic maintenance [41]. In contrast, not only do the males not have as much nutrient reverse as the females, but their reproductive performance is also less likely to be influenced by diet. This assumption can be further tested by measuring the triacylglyceride (triacylglyceride (TAG)) levels across different treatments and sexes.",f8e9d7fe-9da4-4c99-b794-ccab990a993a
25,discussion3," In a recent study, it has been reported that triacylglyceride (TAG) levels decreased in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) subjected to 5-day IF [24]. Given the importance of body nutrient reserve in animals under IF and the lack of information on data about it, it might be interesting to investigate whether there is a sex difference in nutrient reserves such as lipid storage.  Another potential factor is their difference in gene expression when experiencing dietary intervention. Although the female and male are almost similar in genetic architecture, they vary in gene expression, which can possibly generate sex-specific difference [42]. This has already been tested in Caenorhabditis elegans, which is a model organism that displayed lifespan extension in response to DR. Under dietary intervention, the hermaphrodites and males differ in expression levels of gene encoding key enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.",2e21473b-5acc-4d45-bdb6-4afacfd4bfb1
26,discussion4," The males have around twice as many sex-specific gene expression than do the hermaphrodites, and 35% of all C-type lectin genes have higher expression levels in males [43]. Understanding the physiological difference associated with gene expression variation between sexes maybe crucial for understanding the mechanism of sex-specific aging. Additionally, another study with C. elegans indicated that the longevity advantage of hermaphrodites over males was influenced by the terminal transcription factor (TRA-1) of the nematode sex-determination pathway, which can activate the expression of daf-16/ FOXO to regulate development and lifespan [44]. However, whether the protein TRA-1 is evolutionary conserved and functions in other species warrants further investigation.  Duration-dependent response to IF In some empirical studies on dietary intervention, the animals are only treated with one level of IF with controls fed ad libitum [e.g. 25].",b15dedab-37d2-4484-9e8b-ebe139f72a0d
27,discussion5," The protocols of IF applied are usually borrowed from other studies without being tailored to the species involved in a new study. This might be one of the explanations why there is a disparity in existing evidence. For example, every other day feeding regime can be effective in extending lifespan of some rotifers like Brachionus plicatilis [22], but it was reported to be less effective or even detrimental to other species of rotifers such as Cephalodella spp. and E. worallii [41]. Moreover, fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster experienced starvation for 3 h and 6 h per day failed to show longevity extension [23]. In contrast, fruit fly females benefited with longer lifespan when starved for 5 days per week in early adult stage. The males, which was more starvation sensitive, also significantly increased lifespan when fasted for 4 consecutive days per week [24]. These studies suggested that the effects of intermittent fasting was duration and sex dependent.",859063bb-6dfb-47ea-8b7e-11dd9ce3df42
28,discussion6," Therefore, as discussed above, a well-designed fasting regime considering factors such as sex and their difference in starvation tolerance is of great importance in further exploring the influence of IF on health and lifespan.  Relationship between lifespan and reproduction Most previous research on intermittent fast only concerns survival and lifespan, few attempted to explore its potential influence on reproduction. In this study, we assayed the reproductive success of spider mites at different food regimes and the relationship between longevity and reproduction within and between treatments. On the one hand, within each population, a positive linear correlation was found between longevity and lifetime fecundity. The low quality females died early with fewer number of offspring whereas the high quality females lived longer and produced more eggs. Consequently, the high individual heterogeneity in resource acquisition masked the entailed cost of reproduction.",a9876576-1aab-4063-9cd9-535ccbdf8118
29,discussion7," On the other hand, across treatments, the females under IF showed a significant decrease in their fecundity with increasing duration of fasting, which is consistent with findings on rotifer E. worallii [41]. But among all the investigated levels of food regime, the lifespan of females reached a peak at 50% IF, and decreased when fasting levelled up and leading to malnutrition. Clearly, the females reduced daily fecundity and even ceased reproduction during food deprivation. This indicated that under moderate resource limitation (50% IF) the spider mite diverted the energy and nutrient from reproduction to self-maintenance, in line with the leading hypothesis that longevity extension under fasting is an adaptive plastic response of animals reallocating resource from reproduction to somatic.",807a5c26-8233-499e-a188-b3223a49449e
30,discussion8," Furthermore, the long-lived females at 50% IF also demonstrated an older age at maximum reproductive rate, suggesting food restriction retarded the pace of reproduction in comparison with the shorter-lived counterparts fed ad libitum. Collectively, despite the individual heterogeneity masked trade-off between survival and reproduction within each population, clear trade-off was demonstrated among treatments, whereby the spider mites fed ad libitum with abundant resource showed highest lifetime reproduction with a shorter lifespan while females at 50% IF with limited resource prolonged lifespan at the cost of reproductive success.

32,discussion10,"  Conclusions In this study, we extended previous work in the field of IF by taking the sex of subjects and durations of fasting into consideration, representing the first experimental evidence that the response of lifespan to IF is sex and duration dependent. First, the study highlights the fact that females and males are of different sensitivity to starvation and fasting; accordingly, they differed in their patterns of aging when exposed to a series of IF regimes. Other animals with sexual dimorphism may also have a sex-specific response to IF. Second, the reproduction of females decreased across all IF treatments, but lifespan extension was demonstrated in females at intermediate fasting level 50% IF. The females at 50% IF with longer lifespan showed decreased lifetime reproductive success and older age at MRR, which suggests there are substantial costs in reproductive fitness for life span extension in females.",8b81ef42-8a19-4f06-8967-3aadf6305b0e
33,discussion11," One of the common challenges for studies in this field is that although costs of life span extension are well documented in females, few observations have been reported in males, possibly owing to the protocol challenge of measuring reproductive efforts of males. Further work revealing the differences in the relationship between lifespan and reproduction between sexes may give insights into the underlying mechanism of sex-specific response to diet intervention. Additionally, whether the influence of intermittent fasting can be carried over to the next generation, affecting the quality of eggs and their hatching rates as well as other fitness traits of offspring, warrants further investigation.  Abbreviations DRdietary restriction, defined as reducing food intake without malnutrition, is the first and most reproducible intervention supported by a large body of empirical studies in the last few decades.",bf735432-ba75-490f-bbe0-5ef63f435d39
34,discussion12," The concept of DR has been expanded from initial calorie restriction to a wide range of diet-related intervention including short-term starvation, intermittent fasting, and macronutrient (i.e. necessary amino acid, proteins, carbohydrates) restriction.  IFIntermittent fasting, is a feeding pattern that cycles between a period of fasting and non-fasting period.  MRRMaximum reproductive rate is the highest daily fecundity of a female in throughout life.  sexual size dimorphism (SSD)Sexual size dimorphism, is the difference of body size between male and female of the same species.
