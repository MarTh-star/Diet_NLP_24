0,introduction0," Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is the predominant cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide, causing considerable liver-related and extrahepatic morbidity and mortality (1). It is a clinical and pathological syndrome characterized by excessive fat deposits in hepatocytes, resulting from causes other than factors including alcohol and liver damage (2). Patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even chronic kidney disease, and mortality from liver-related and non-liver-related causes appears more significant than in the general population (3–6). The increasing prevalence of the disease worldwide is thus particularly worrisome.",1b193368-621a-40df-aa05-16e357f02935
1,introduction1," Given that there are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), lifestyle modification (through dietary and exercise interventions) remains the underlying approach for the treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (7). Paired liver biopsy studies have demonstrated that a ≥5% loss of body weight (BW) is associated with significant reductions in hepatic steatosis (HS), ≥7% loss of weight is associated with a decrease in hepatic inflammation, and a ≥10% loss is associated with a reduction in fibrosis (8).  Since dietary interventions play an important role in weight loss management, it is necessary to study suitable dietary interventions for patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Intermittent fasting, which includes alternate-day fasting, and other forms of periodic caloric restriction have already received attention from animal research scientists (9, 10).",d1e11748-6f78-469e-bb63-ff29a8394fc8
2,introduction2," It has been shown that fasting may benefit weight management and improve cardiovascular and metabolic risks (11).  Although there exist some clinical trials assessing the effect of intermittent fasting on non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), there has been no meta-analysis of these clinical trials, and there is a lack of evidence-based medical evidence on the effect of intermittent fasting on non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (12–17). Therefore, in this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to include clinical trials that adopt fasting intervention for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and to evaluate the effect of fasting on factors associated with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

3,methods0," Literature searches were conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to May 10, 2021.   This research study was performed according to the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses (PRISMA)) (Supplementary Table 1) (18).  Search Strategy  We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to find relevant studies up to May 10, 2021, in all languages using a combination of the main search terms “fasting” and “non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).” The search strategy was designed to be as broad as possible. Then, the reference lists of the relevant studies were checked for additional studies. The detailed search strategy is presented in Supplementary Table 2.  Two authors (YC and LJ) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts.",a853ee92-bff4-417d-b5a7-62e52b2a5662
4,methods1," Discrepancies were resolved through discussions among the two authors. The two authors then independently analyzed the full text of the remaining studies to determine the final inclusion.  Study Selection and Data Extraction  For this meta-analysis, inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) participants with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were adult humans aged ≥18 years across different countries; (2) the intervention group underwent fasting intervention alone or in conjunction with other lifestyle interventions; (3) the comparator group underwent no nutritional intervention (“control”) or a different type of nutritional intervention; (4) the full text was available and was written in English; (5) the trial included evaluation of at least one of the following outcomes: BW, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), waist circumference (WC), fasting blood sugar/glucose (FBS/GLU), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),",8331754f-8a18-41fa-94d1-939140f39eec

Animal studies and uncontrolled and cross-sectional studies were not included.  Two authors (YC and LJ) extracted data from the selected trials. This process was verified by another investigator (HM). An Excel database was used to extract the following information from the included studies: (1) study characteristics (e.g., names of the authors, year, sample size, and ages of the patients), (2) treatments, (3) methodological aspects, and (4) clinical outcomes.",174b09c2-7689-4ccf-8e9a-0c1204094c8f
6,methods3," To obtain the data not presented in the original studies, we sent two e-mails 1 week apart to the corresponding authors.  Risk of Bias Assessment  We followed the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to assess the risk of bias of these included studies, which included detection bias (outcome assessment blinding), selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (selective reporting) (19). We assessed every domain of bias in terms of methodological quality and assigned a rating of low or high risk of bias. If there was insufficient information to make an adequate assessment, the domain was evaluated as “unclear”.  Statistical Analysis  A series of calculations were executed to standardize the data in terms of SD as some studies reported CIs. The conversion of 95% CI to SD was calculated by SD=N×upper limit- lower limit2t;t=tinv(1-0.95, NE+NC-2)  (19).",ac300855-e69b-408d-8e79-ea0a5528a5e9
7,methods4," The mean change from baseline to after placebo or treatment was calculated by Xc¯=Xa¯-Xb¯, and the SD of change was calculated by Sc=Sa2+Sb2-2×corr×Sa×Sb (19). We calculated SD for the change values by selecting 0.5 as the correlation coefficient (r = 0.5), and to make sure that the meta-analysis was not sensitive to the selected correlation coefficient, all analyses were repeated using correlation coefficients of 0.2 and 0.8.  The mean difference (MD) and its corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using the random effects model, which takes the between-study heterogeneity into account (19). Heterogeneity was assessed statistically using the standard chi-square I2 test. A random effects model using the double-arcsine transformation approach was used. I2 values ≤ 25, 25–50, 50–75, and >75% indicated no, small, moderate, and significant heterogeneities, respectively.",43a17cc7-fdbc-4814-8e89-94ec2dfe6c78
8,methods5," To examine the potential sources of between-study heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were performed according to the type of control diet (religious intermittent fasting/modern intermittent fasting regimens). A sensitivity analysis was conducted only when three or more studies were included in the comparison. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of the results of meta-analyses by sequentially removing individually included studies. The presence of the publication bias was checked for each outcome through funnel plots. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger regression asymmetry test when the comparison contained at least 10 studies. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA MP, version 16, and two-sided p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ",34f40412-9db2-470d-b7ec-6a70d75653f5

In the meta-analysis, there were significant differences in BW, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), alanine aminotransferase (aminotransferase (ALT)), and aspartate transaminase (aspartate transaminase (AST)) between the control and fasting group. Up to now, there is no significant difference in triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and other metabolic parameters between the two groups.  Conclusions: Intermittent fasting is beneficial for weight management and liver enzyme improvement, but long-term feasibility and safety of intermittent fasting should be conducted in further studies.",e8e18cb4-8bf7-490f-b47b-6bbbe07f669a

23,discussion0," Obesity results from excess calories are a significant risk factor for developing insulin resistance (IR), a critical factor in the etiology of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (20, 21). In turn, IR promotes the development of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a subset of patients that could evolve to a more severe form, i.e., non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Unfortunately, science is far from thoroughly clarifying the genesis of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and suggesting appropriate therapy to reduce or eliminate them drastically (22). At present, there are no approved pharmacological therapies for non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Many guidelines advocate recommendations focusing on controlling risk factors and lifestyle changes that include dietary and physical activities (15). Dietary restriction increases the endogenous synthesis of fatty acids.",e064daed-871d-4cbb-9762-fc30075f34f2
24,discussion1," Dietary and endogenously synthesized fatty acids contribute to the whole-body fatty acid pool (22, 23). Intermittent fasting is the established diet paradigm that extends life span and health span across species (21, 24).  Diet and exercise are among the most commonly used ones but complicated to maintain due to the ability of each organism to balance the reduced intake of calories with a decrease in resting metabolic rate, thus frustrating the beneficial effect (25). Therefore, based on the medical history and preferences of patients, appropriate individualized diet and exercise prescriptions should be developed. This is best approached with a healthcare team including a physician, registered dietitian, and exercise physiologist.",fd229223-bda6-4466-a592-d2857685874d
25,discussion2," Through this slow and thoughtful process of cycles of weight loss and weight maintenance, it is thought that patients will be able to prevent the more debilitating cycles of rapid weight loss, short-term reductions in metabolic rate, and rapid weight gain (25).  This study is the first time to evaluate the effectiveness of intermittent fasting on weight loss and improvement of liver function-related parameters in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). On the basis of this meta-analysis, we confirmed an improvement in aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) through fasting compared with a non-fasting control group. This seems to be related to a decrease in BW and a reduction in body mass index (BMI). Earlier meta-analyses have shown similar results that intermittent fasting was more effective than the control for body mass index (BMI) and BW (9, 10).",d180101b-61a1-48b3-8af7-c36ab30b3825
26,discussion3,"  Studies in rodents have demonstrated that TRF improves metabolic profiles and reduces the risk of obesity and its related conditions (26, 27). Similarly, all six studies in our meta-analysis that directly compared the fasted group with the non-fasted group showed that fasting was not only beneficial for weight and body mass index (BMI) reduction but also for aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) reduction, with a statistical significance. By pooling the data, we provide clear evidence that fasting can reduce BW, body mass index (BMI), aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). None of the six included studies were confounded by exercise or other interventions. Therefore, intermittent fasting has an independent and significant benefit on weight loss and improvement of liver function in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",9cf01a34-274f-4f49-ab3b-11ce3dadbd4d
27,discussion4," Recent research studies reported similar results that short-term, isocaloric TRF would diminish the severity of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and improve metabolic parameters associated with liver function in short-term diet-restricted fasted mice (28). The beneficial effects of fasting are often regarded as driven by reductions in BW and/or body fat (29). In addition, the mechanism for the direct hepatic benefit of fasting is considered to be related to its effect on circadian biology, gut microbiome, and modifiable lifestyle behaviors (26, 30–33).  We failed to observe the benefits of fasting on metabolism-related parameters such as TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, FBS/GLU, HOMA-IR, and fasting insulin (FINS). Among the included studies, four studies reported improvements in lipid metabolism indicators, such as TG, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C. In contrast, the above indicators did not show significant differences during statistical analysis by STATA.",6d59da2f-82f4-4025-b6a0-3fd1b978c78c
28,discussion5," This may be related to the fact that there are few available literature studies with high heterogeneity among them. Thus, the effect of fasting on lipid metabolism needs to be further confirmed by more clinical RCTs.  This meta-analysis provides evidence for the effect of intermittent fasting on weight reduction and improvement of liver function. However, few included studies and the low sample size would affect and limit the meta-analysis results. Four of the six included studies were religion-related fasting, and only two were RCTs, which is also an important reason for heterogeneity. More studies on large-scale randomized controlled intervention are needed to better inform clinical recommendations for fasting interventions in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Long-term control and maintenance of weight are more important, while follow-up support is lacking in the six studies included this time.",788f93d3-2af6-42bc-961a-43ac636e7843
29,discussion6," In addition, safety is essential for fasting interventions but is severely lacking.  Conclusions  Intermittent fasting is beneficial for weight management and liver enzyme improvement, but long-term feasibility and safety of intermittent fasting should be conducted in further studies.
