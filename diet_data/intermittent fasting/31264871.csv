Intervention Period Intervention periods ranged from 4 to 8 weeks. Three studies that investigated Ramadan fasting were approximately 4 weeks in duration [29,30,31]. Three studies that investigated time restricted feeding (TRF) were 8 weeks in duration [24,25,26], while a fourth was 4 weeks in duration [27]. The one study that investigated modified alternate day fasting (ADF) was 8 weeks in duration [28].  3.2.",71d279fe-5113-4f65-8537-6bb6d4c69055
6,methods6," Participant Characteristics Of the eight studies included, there were a combined total of 219 participants across all groups, including 153 males and 66 females. Twenty-seven individuals withdrew from their respective studies [25,26,27,28], leaving 192 individuals completing the interventions. A total of 120 individuals completed the IF intervention arm and 72 completed the comparison arms. The sex distribution of final numbers of completed participants could not be accurately determined, given that one study did not report the sex of withdrawn participants [28]. Eight participants from two studies were excluded from analysis due to non-compliance [25,27]. Previous exercise/training history was varied between studies, with some participants classified as recreationally active [25,31] or resistance trained [26,27,29,30]. One study provided insufficient details regarding previous exercise/training history, though it was noted participants were unfamiliar with resistance exercise [25].",0bf61a99-b363-4ec1-81af-140ab9fc156f
7,methods7," The age of the participants ranged from young adults (22.0 ± 2.4 year) [25] to middle-aged adults (40.6 ± 10.0 year) [28]. body mass index (BMI) ranged from normal weight (22.5 ± no SD) [26] to moderately overweight (28.3 ± 4.1) [28]. Only three studies reported the body mass index (BMI) of participants [28,29,30]; the body mass index (BMI) of the remaining studies was calculated using mean baseline height and weight values. Baseline body fat percentage ranged from 12.9 ± 3.5% [31] to 34.9 ± 4.6% [28], though it should be noted that various assessment techniques were used.  3.3. Intervention—Fasting Protocol Of the eight studies reviewed, three studies investigated Ramadan fasting [29,30,31], with fasting durations approximately 14–15 h per day. Only one of these studies included a control diet group [30], while the remaining Ramadan studies reported no control diet group. Four studies utilised time restricted feeding (TRF) [24,25,26,27].",d4bf2fe3-998e-4cbc-bb1a-e5b3fe22f39e
8,methods8," Of those, one study instructed participants to consume their daily intake within a 4 h window between 4 p.m. and midnight, 4 days per week, with no restrictions on food choices or overall intake [25]. On the other 3 days per week, participants were allowed ad libitum intake. Three studies instructed participants to consume all of their daily intake within an 8 h window [24,26,27]. The first of these involved participants consuming 100% of their estimated energy requirements over three regular intervals at 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. every day [24]. The second study allowed intake between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m. without set intervals, aimed for participants to be in a small energy deficit (~250 kcal), and to consume a high protein diet (≥1.4 g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day) [26].",ecbde25e-ad58-4714-9479-ed2f7cf5b6b0
9,methods9," This study also included another time restricted feeding (TRF) group with the same guidelines, but which consumed an additional 3 g of β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (hydroxy β methylbutyrate (HMB)) per day. The third study allowed participants the choice of consuming their energy intake between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m., or 1 p.m. and 9 p.m. [27]. Participants aimed to restrict energy by approximately 25% of estimated requirements, and also consume 1.8 g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day. Comparison diet groups included: usual dietary intake with no time restrictions or scheduled times of consumption [25]; usual dietary intake, but consumed within a 13 h period and scheduled times of consumption (8 a.m., 1 p.m. and 8 p.m.) [24]; eating at self-selected intervals but with the same 250 kcal energy deficit and a protein intake of ≥1.4 g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day [26]; and the final study also prescribed a 25% energy restriction, with a goal of 1.",b4ec205b-a557-4ef0-a14c-24acd0a1830c

The eighth study included used a modified alternate day fasting (ADF) protocol, with participants consuming ~25% of their energy requirements on every other day with ad libitum feeding on non-fasting days [28]. Participants were instructed to consume all their meals between 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. on fasting days. The comparison groups maintained their usual dietary habits.  3.4. Intervention—Resistance Training Protocol The majority of studies [24,25,26,27,28,29,30] utilised a body building style workout, with 3–4 sessions per week, upper and lower or full body routines, varying from 3–15 repetitions per set and some working to failure [24,25].",66dc2411-57de-4949-9c38-60518f4373c3
11,methods11," Most of these studies performed the resistance training sessions in a fed state [24,25,26,27,28], with one study instructing participants to undertake their training session during their Ramadan fasting period [30], whereas a similar study compared training sessions performed during Ramadan fasting period and during the break in fasting (fed state) [29]. One study used a combination of resistance and aerobic exercise [28]. Participants completed 40 min of resistance training three times per week, varying between 10 to 15 repetitions utilising a combination of upper and lower body exercises. This was followed by at least 20 min of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (60–85% of maximal heart rate) on a motorised treadmill. Finally, in one study participants undertook two to five sessions per week at a ‘weight training gymnasium’, no other details were provided [31].  3.5.",e9172e7d-eb81-4b36-947b-f8bbc7d9ed7a

However, the time restricted feeding (TRF) group significantly reduced their fat mass (−1.6 kg ± 1.53, p = 0.0005) compared to the control diet. Similarly, Tinsley et al. [26] utilised an 8 h window for participants to consume their meals, but aimed for an overall small energy deficit (~250 kcal) in all groups. Despite a prescribed overall calorie deficit for both time restricted feeding (TRF) and control diets, all groups combined significantly increased their body weight and lean body mass (LBM), with no difference between groups.",5cc53f92-fe27-4624-b469-cf454609a65f
13,methods13," Only the time restricted feeding (TRF) plus hydroxy β methylbutyrate (HMB) group experienced a significant reduction in body fat and body fat percentage compared to baseline, and only in the per protocol analysis, with intention to treat analysis showing no significant difference. While the time restricted feeding (TRF) group did experience a mean reduction in these measures, this was not significant at week 8. However, all groups combined did experience a reduction in body fat percentage from baseline.  In a previous study from the same author, Tinsley et al. [25] used a shorter time restricted feeding (TRF) protocol of 4 h and reported no significant changes in body composition in either the time restricted feeding (TRF) or habitual diet (control) group. It should be noted that the authors did report a non-significant increase in average lean body mass (LBM) (2.3 kg) in the habitual diet group, albeit with a small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.25). More recently, Stratton et al.",b84ac44c-d940-4625-9533-a3fa523c025e
14,methods14," [27] investigated the effects of time restricted feeding (TRF) with an 8 h feeding window compared to a control diet, with participants in both groups prescribed a 25% energy deficit and 1.8 g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day.

Effect of Modified alternate day fasting (ADF) on lean body mass (LBM), Body Weight and Fat In the one study that investigated modified alternate day fasting (ADF) [28], the authors separated participants into four groups: modified alternate day fasting plus exercise group, modified alternate day fasting only, exercise plus habitual diet and habitual diet only. Intention to treat analysis revealed a significant decrease in lean body mass (LBM) (−0.4 ± 0.5 kg) in the modified alternate day fasting (ADF) plus exercise group from baseline (p < 0.",f3c0acd7-65fe-4349-a6fa-75ae9d1bc241

Both modified alternate day fasting (ADF) with exercise and modified alternate day fasting (ADF) alone reported significant decreases in body weight (−3.3 ± 2.4 kg and −2.4 ± 3.1 kg respectively) compared to baseline, though this was only significant compared to the control diet in the combination group. The combined group also reported significant decreases in both fat mass and body fat percentage, −2.7 ± 2.0 kg and −2.5 ± 2.2%, respectively, compared to baseline, and this was significantly different to the habitual diet only group. However, the modified alternate day fasting (ADF) only group reported a significant decrease in body fat percentage only (−1.26 ± 2.4%) compared to baseline.  3.7.",aead266a-5a17-4fdb-ba3d-3ad7f1c163b8
16,methods16," Effect of Ramadan Fasting on lean body mass (LBM), Body Weight and Fat Trabelsi and colleagues published two studies investigating Ramadan fasting in conjunction with resistance training four times per week in recreational bodybuilders [29,30]. In both studies, the fasting groups demonstrated no significant change in lean body mass (LBM), body weight, body fat mass, and body fat percentage [29,30]. In the 2012 study [30], Trabelsi incorporated a non-fasting habitual diet control group. Compared to the Ramadan fasters, the control group demonstrated a significant increase in body weight (~1.9 kg, p < 0.05), with non-significant increases in both fat mass and lean body mass (LBM). In the 2013 study [29], a strength of the study design was that authors controlled for diet prior to exercise, in order to determine if exercising in a ‘fasted’ versus ‘non-fasted, fed’ state influenced changes in body composition.",b130df32-8015-4929-a82c-3cdae0d0f4a2
17,methods17," Similar changes in body composition were observed for both the fasted and fed exercise groups.  The study by Stannard et al. [31] found that recreationally active males undertaking two to five sessions of ‘weight-training gymnasium’ exercise, in conjunction with Ramadan fasting, resulted in no significant changes in lean body mass (LBM), despite an average body weight loss of −1.3 kg (p = 0.019) and a −0.7 kg reduction in fat mass (p = 0.033).  3.8. Methods of Anthropometrical Assessment The anthropometric assessment used in the studies varied with skinfold tests [29,30], bioelectrical impedance analysis (bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)) [28], dual X-ray absorptiometry (dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA)) [24,25], underwater weighing [31], and a four compartment model, combining dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioimpedance spectroscopy [26] or dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioimpedance spectroscopy and air displacement plethysmography [27] used.  3.9.",803dc298-6952-4dee-8c10-ed31b3e843a4
18,methods18," Reported Adherence to Dietary Protocols Only two of the included studies reported adherence rates to the fasting protocol [25,26]. Adherence rates were calculated by dividing the number of days adherent by the total number of fasting days [25,26]. Tinsley et al. [25] reported a high level of adherence, with participants completing an average of 95.9 ± 4.1% of the 32 time restricted feeding (TRF) fasting days over the 8-week duration. However, 3 of the 14 participants (21%) from the time restricted feeding (TRF) intervention group were excluded from the overall analysis due to a <80% compliance, while another participant dropped out due to unknown reasons. Within the control group (habitual diet), 6 of the 14 participants (43%) did not finish the intervention.",1e08d1df-ebd0-4dd1-8ed7-50d83131bc42
19,methods19," Participants also rated the difficulty of adhering to the time restricted feeding (TRF) intervention using a 10 cm visual analogue scale, with a rating of zero on the left hand side of the scale indicating program adherence was ‘extremely easy’, and 10 on the right hand side indicating adherence was ‘extremely difficult’. After 4 weeks, difficulty was rated at 3.6 ± 1.4 out of 10, and did not change significantly by the end of the study (3.8 ± 2.2, p = 0.86). Some participants reported difficulty initially with the fast regime, but commented that it became easier after several days. In their other study, Tinsley et al. [26] reported a 89 ± 8% compliance with their meal timing protocol, based on intention to treat analysis, increasing to 91 ± 3% using per protocol analysis. Participants were excluded from the per protocol analysis if they had less than 80% adherence to the eating schedule, or completed less than 22 of 24 resistance training sessions.",9c55a17f-bbc6-4352-ae68-1d8a6d1663c1
20,methods20," Overall, 12 of 13 participants allocated to the time restricted feeding (TRF) and 10 of 13 in the time restricted feeding (TRF) plus hydroxy β methylbutyrate (HMB) group completed the study, while only 9 of 14 completed in the control group. In other studies, adherence was monitored by participants completing dietary logs every day during the intervention period [28] or through a structured interview performed by a dietitian [24]. However, dietary data and adherence was not reported. None of the Ramadan fasting studies included measured adherence to the protocol.  3.10. Quality Appraisal All studies included in the present review scored between 16–20 points on the Downs and Black checklist out of a possible 27 [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31].  4.",86cf663d-4b2c-4c06-ad37-29d4de50c94e
21,methods21," Discussion To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review to systematically analyse the published literature on the combined effects of IF and resistance training on changes in lean body mass (LBM) in recreationally active and non-elite trained individuals. The major finding is that, despite heterogeneity in study design, especially fasting method, lean body mass (LBM) was generally maintained when IF and resistance training were undertaken concurrently during the short to medium term. Though four studies observed mean increases in lean body mass (LBM) [24,26,29,31], only one study reported a statistically significant increase (0.9–1.2 kg) [26]. Interestingly, the study that reported the statistically significant increase in lean body mass (LBM) also observed a mean increase in participants’ body weights, which is in contrast to all other studies, and indicates that energy balance may be a potential contributing factor.",dacd36ca-2e28-429a-802a-bd352b89632a
22,methods22," Thus, it remains unclear whether lean body mass (LBM) accrual is possible when fasting, combined with resistance training, results in an overall energy deficit. Additionally, the length of the intervention may also be a factor given most studies were only 4–8 weeks in duration. Therefore, further research is needed to examine the longer term effects of these interventions, but also other forms of IF, with the majority of studies focusing on time restricted feeding (TRF) and Ramadan style fasting.  For many individuals, the primary goal of resistance training is to increase lean body mass (LBM), or at the very least, maintain it. Of the eight studies included and reviewed, only one study showed a reduction in lean body mass (LBM) from baseline when IF and resistance training were undertaken together [28]. However, it should be noted that this reduction was small, and although significant, was not significantly different to the other experimental groups in the study [28].",aedbd9a8-14d4-4dfc-8662-2a51599f368c
23,methods23," This small reduction could be due to the addition of aerobic exercise (20 min) at the end of each resistance training session with evidence suggesting that concurrent training (performing both resistance and aerobic exercise together) may compromise resistance training-induced muscle adaptations due to the “concurrent training effect” (CTE) [32]. However, whether CTE is the reason for the lean body mass (LBM) reduction in the Oh et al. [28] study is unknown.  Whilst the majority of studies included suggest that lean body mass (LBM) can be maintained when undertaking IF and resistance training together, it is less clear whether or not the accrual of lean body mass (LBM) is compromised. A number of studies did report mean increases in lean body mass (LBM) [24,26,29,31], however, only one study reported a statistically significant increase (0.9–1.2 kg) [26].",faac4516-af49-4931-b7a1-508c459490d8
24,methods24," This was evident by a main effect for time, with no difference (interaction) between the time restricted feeding (TRF) or normal diet groups. Of particular note is that, despite participants in this study being prescribed an energy deficit of ~250 kcal per day, energy intake actually increased over the intervention period, which led to an increase in mean weight for all groups by the end of the study. Given this was the only study to show a meaningful and significant increase in lean body mass (LBM), it does suggest that an apparent energy surplus (as evidenced by a mean increase in weight) could be a major determinant in supporting training-induced adaptations, such as muscle growth [33]. Therefore, it raises an important question of whether IF compromises growth of lean body mass (LBM) when undertaking resistance training without an apparent energy surplus.",995ed401-c615-43a2-8433-51acb06d658d
25,methods25," Interestingly, changes in lean body mass (LBM) were not statistically different between intervention and ‘normal diet’ control groups in the studies that included such a comparative group [24,25,26,27,28,30]. This is somewhat surprising, given most, though not all, resistance training interventions lead to an increase in lean body mass (LBM) [34]. It is possible the length of training (i.e., 4–8 weeks) used in the reviewed studies did not allow adequate time for significant growth to occur. Although the time-course of muscle hypertrophy is poorly defined, it is usually expected to begin within a couple of months for untrained individuals, with those with prior training experience observing the effects later [35]. Furthermore, while most training programs were of similar frequency across studies (i.e., 3–4 sessions per week), the number of repetitions, load and whether or not participants worked to failure varied, which may have affected total volume of work.",a6a4c51d-2d0f-4ae2-b969-a804bc375a05
26,methods26," Indeed, variation in overall volume, as opposed to frequency, seems to have greater impact on muscle growth [36]. Thus, it is likely that the relatively short durations and variations in volume/effort of training programs used in the reviewed studies, rather than IF per se was an important determining factor in the observed effects on lean body mass (LBM). It is clear that further research is needed that incorporates longer training programs (>8 weeks), to gain a better understanding of the impact of IF on training-induced adaptations.  Protein intake is another major determinant of training-induced changes in lean body mass (LBM) [37]. Of the six studies that reported it [24,25,26,27,29,30], protein intake ranged from 1.2 g/kg/day to 1.9 g/kg/day, which is close to or above the level recommended for lean body mass (LBM) maintenance and accrual [37].",e0368645-3cc3-44a7-8279-a9c348949c3f
27,methods27," In the one study that reported a lean body mass (LBM) loss [28], no protein intake was reported, and indeed no emphasis appeared to be given to protein intake for participants. While it is possible that insufficient protein intake could be a contributing factor for the observed lean body mass (LBM) loss, participants in this study also lost the most weight compared to all other included studies, possibly due to a combination of the more severe energy restriction protocol used and the extra aerobic exercise component included. Thus, larger weight reductions and periods of greater energy deficit (though not directly measured) could also be a contributing factor.  The observed effects of IF and resistance training on fat mass and body fat percentage were less consistent. Five studies reported statistically significant changes in body fat mass or body fat percentage [24,26,27,28,31]. The remaining three studies [22,26,27] reported no significant changes.",4d69df95-ef1b-4d63-8b5d-54bdf3e56154
28,methods28," Body fat losses ranged from an average of 0.7 kg to 2.7 kg, while body fat percentage reductions ranged from 0.8–2.5%. The variability in fat loss is likely a reflection of intervention duration, total energy intake and participant characteristics, such as sex and baseline weight status. The modified alternate day fasting (ADF) study [28] demonstrated the greatest weight and fat loss compared to other fasting protocols. This is to be expected given they prescribed the most severe energy restriction, included an extra aerobic exercise component and had the equal longest duration. However, weight loss does not appear to be a pre-requisite for changes in body fat or body fat percentage in the studies reviewed. While four of the five studies that showed changes in these measures resulted in (generally small) concomitant weight loss [24,27,28,31], one study showed a reduction in fat, despite a gain in weight [26].",fb45c56e-ec26-4c15-bed9-9ecd01fa1077
29,methods29," This provides evidence that IF with resistance training can improve body composition (at least with regard to body fat loss) independent of large energy deficits. Changes in metabolic fuel preference during fasting is a likely mechanism behind the enhanced fat loss, with a decline in carbohydrate oxidation and increases in fat oxidation, ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis evident [38,39]. However, whether these contribute to meaningful changes in body fat levels requires further investigation.  There are several limitations associated with this review and the included studies. Firstly, our review only considered changes in whole body lean body mass (LBM), which does not capture local changes in muscle hypertrophy. Half of the included studies (all time restricted feeding (TRF) studies) did use more sensitive assessments of muscle hypertrophy (i.e., muscle ultrasound).",3f491098-b1d9-42f7-9b48-37e0d58d8470
30,methods30," While two studies showed similar directional change in comparison to the whole body lean body mass (LBM) changes assessed by dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) or a 4C model [24,27], the other two reported conflicting results [26,27]. Given the majority of studies comparing these different techniques have been undertaken in clinical (i.e., sarcopenic) populations, it is clear that further work is needed in populations included in this review. Secondly, most studies did not include an IF only comparator group, making it unclear whether there is an additive effect of resistance training on lean body mass (LBM) compared to IF alone. Thirdly, the included studies were all of a short to medium duration, and results cannot be generalised to longer intervention periods. Finally, while the authors tried make our search comprehensive, we focused on the published literature only.  5.",f29d7c04-5934-4837-809e-aaab34764a9e
31,methods31," Conclusions Lean body mass is generally maintained when IF, including when followed for religious reasons, is combined with resistance training. However, whether or not IF inhibits lean body mass (LBM) accrual is unclear, and may be contingent on the adequate provision of protein, and energy balance. The combination of IF and resistance training may also lead to a reduction in body fat, not only during apparent energy deficit, but also energy surplus. Given low muscle mass and poor muscle strength are important risk factors for disability and potentially mortality, especially in older individuals, these findings may also have important clinical implications. Future research should aim to examine the longer-term effects of various IF regimes with resistance training on lean body mass (LBM), incorporating varying levels of energy intake, and, where possible, appropriate non-exercise and non-fasting control groups.",f9ead920-f913-430d-805d-cd3ef15f6648
32,methods32," Furthermore, given the growing popularity of IF for weight loss, future research should also consider whether IF paired with resistance training is more or less effective and sustainable compared to other traditional forms of energy restriction diets.
