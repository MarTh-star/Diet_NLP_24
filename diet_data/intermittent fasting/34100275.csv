0,background0," Carbohydrate-restricted diets and intermittent fasting (IF) have been rapidly gaining interest among the general population and patients with cardiometabolic disease, such as overweight or obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. However, there are limited expert recommendations for these dietary regimens. This study aimed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence on the benefits and harms of carbohydrate-restricted diets and IF to make responsible recommendations. ",c0097d5d-b2a7-4b04-bf45-78a8aa925b94
1,methods0," A systematic literature search was performed by a professional librarian for the meta-analysis with the key question “Are carbohydrate-restricted diets or IF helpful in the management of patients with overweight or obesity, diabetes, and hypertension?”. MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMbase, Cochrane, and KoreaMed databases were used, and among the literature published in English and Korean from January 1, 2000, to June 8, 2021, only randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that tested the effectiveness of carbohydrate-restricted diets or IF with a study period of more than 8 weeks were included. The search strategy in MEDLINE is shown in Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 1. Further, the framework of the population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (population intervention comparator and outcomes (PICO)) in developing the focused question (Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 2), and literature selection and exclusion process (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig.",fd1693d2-ab1c-4910-abd5-5051573b476d
2,methods1," 1), as well as the summary of studies included in the meta-analysis consisting of 50 RCTs (66 articles) on carbohydrate-restricted diets (Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 3) [16–81], and eight RCTs (ten articles) on IF (Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 4) [82–91]), are presented in the Additional file 1: supplementary data.  In most clinical studies, carbohydrate-restricted diets are classified as moderately-low carbohydrate diets (moderately low carbohydrate diets (MCD)) with carbohydrates accounting for 26–45% of total caloric intake, low carbohydrate diets (low carbohydrate diets (LCD)) with carbohydrates accounting for 10–25%, and very-low carbohydrate diets (Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD)) with carbohydrates accounting for less than 10% [92]. Considering that the average carbohydrate intake rate is about 65% in South Korea, which is significantly higher than that of other countries, and that the greater the restriction, the lower the adherence [93].",8e3000e7-f0bd-464d-a433-9d436e6f3511
3,methods2," Thus, we evaluated moderately low carbohydrate diets (MCD) and low carbohydrate diets (LCD) as a combined category, moderately-low carbohydrate or low carbohydrate diets (mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD)) (Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 5). IF includes several different dietary regimens, such as time-restricted feeding, alternate-day fasting, and intermittent energy restriction, as well as those with similar meanings. The comparative diets were diets with calorie restriction equivalent to those of the intervention diets, and most were included in a calorie-restricted diet and a low fat diet. Even if it was indicated as a standard diet, it was included in the analysis if the same degree of caloric restriction was achieved.  Outcome variables included anthropometric measurements like body weight, glycemic control indicators like HbA1c, and cardiovascular risk factors like blood pressure and lipid profiles.",da6884a3-819e-4c1b-9cda-cb3090c2e8d2
4,methods3," Detailed primary and secondary outcome variables will be described in each recommendation for each study population. The analysis of outcome variables was performed by classifying as follows according to the duration of the intervention: for 6 months or less (9 to 24 weeks), for more than 6 months to 1 year or less (36 weeks to 52 weeks), and for more than 1 year. The quality of evidence for key outcome variables was evaluated and presented within 6 months since most of the results were performed within this period, and the recommendations were provided in a short-term period of 6 months or less.  We assessed the risk of bias in the included trials using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs [94]. Each trial was assessed by two independent observers, and any differences were resolved by a third observer.",8b8a9f3a-44b5-4d15-a0c2-a1e65756e4cc
5,methods4," The final grade of recommendation and level of evidence for each statement was determined using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system [95]. All subcommittee members participated in the joint production of each part of the guideline, from inception to publication. When the agreement was incomplete regarding the final grade of recommendation and level of evidence, consensus from the chair, vice-chair, and two assigned reviewers of the subcommittee have made the outcome. Recommendations formulated by the subcommittees were reviewed by the entire members of all five committees from the four academic societies that participated in this study.",5f6d46da-c02b-4814-912f-d06a08a666cb
6,methods5,"  Recommendation and evaluation of evidence for carbohydrate-restricted diets in adults with overweight or obesity  Recommendation  In adults with overweight or obesity, a moderately-low carbohydrate diet or low carbohydrate diet (mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD)) can be considered a dietary regimen for weight reduction since similar or greater effects on weight loss are observed than the generally recommended diets. [Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence].1. A low carbohydrate diet does not imply an extreme reduction in carbohydrate and increase in fat intake, and must not be practiced indiscriminately.  2. A low carbohydrate diet should reduce total caloric intake while avoiding an increase in the intake of saturated and trans fatty acids.  3. After considering sustainability and balance between benefits and risks, we decided not to provide a recommendation for very-low carbohydrate diets (Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD)).",d78409b4-a51f-4990-bcfe-8141a827f2c4
7,methods6,"  	  Level of evidence  In the meta-analysis, 63 articles from 47 RCTs were included. While overweight or obesity was an inclusion criterion for the meta-analysis, obese patients with a body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) of ≥30 kg/m2 were included in many cases, and a small number of studies included patients with type 2 diabetes. Although studies were conducted in various countries, no studies were conducted in South Korea, and only few targeted Asians. However, studies conducted in China, Japan, and Taiwan, which have similar demographic characteristics to South Korea, had similar overall results. Due to the nature of the studies, in most cases, participants were not blinded, or related information was not described. Low fat (44.7%) and calorie-restricted (29.8%) diets were the most common control diets. The dropout rate of participants was within 20–30%. Although the risk of bias differed depending on the study, it was generally low (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 2).",b29e0ca9-0506-4a0b-82f5-7612c18ed3bc
8,methods7," If the sufficient effect (clinical decision threshold) was not reached, it was judged that there was imprecision. Since the dropout rate was high and the two groups were heterogenous, it was judged that there was indirectness, and thus, the level of evidence was downgraded and evaluated as either low or moderate (Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 6) (Table 1).Table 1 Summary of finding for effects of carbohydrate-restricted diets and intermittent fasting in adults with overweight/obesity  Outcome	Illustrative comparative effecta (95% CI)	No. of participants	Quality of the evidence (GRADE)	 Assumed effect (control)	Corresponding effect	 mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD)b					  Body weight, kg (follow-up: 8–24 weeks)	–3.74	–1.03 (–1.68 to –0.39)	3,660 (24 studies)	⊕⊕⊝⊝  Low  	  Body mass index, kg/m2 (follow-up: 8–24 weeks)	–1.5	–0.23 (–0.46 to 0.00)	2,750 (15 studies)	⊕⊝⊝⊝  Very low  	  Waist circumference, cm (follow-up: 12–24 weeks)	–4.83	–0.65 (–1.16 to –0.",0fba630e-493a-4178-b3e3-de4c10d9f508

However, there was no significant decrease in a study period of more than 1 year (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 5A). Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) led to a decreasing trend in the fat mass compared with the control diet in all studies, but it was not statistically significant (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 5B).  In all studies, mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) did not lead to any significant change in body fat percentage compared with the control diet (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 6A). Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) resulted to a significant decrease in body fat percentage by 1.88% (95% CI: − 2.87, − 0.89) for 6 months or less compared to the control diet, and 1.56% (95% CI: − 2.41, − 0.71) for more than 6 months to 1 year or less (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig.",b22b2b32-02fb-486c-957a-5f5d676abbef

Lipid profile, blood pressure, glycemic control, and other metabolic parameters  Triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were evaluated. In mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD), the TG level decreased by 13.76 mg/dl (95% CI: − 19.78, − 7.74) for 6 months or less compared to the control diet (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 7A). In Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD), the TG level significantly decreased by 21.33 mg/dl (95% CI: − 30.46, − 12.21) for 6 months or less, and 22.52 mg/dl (95% CI: − 31.01, − 14.03) for more than 6 months to 1 year or less (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 7B). mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) showed a significant increase in HDL-C level compared to control diet in all periods (6 months or less: 2.61 mg/dl [95% CI: 1.34, 3.89], more than 6 months to 1 year or less: 1.45 mg/dl [95% CI: 0.53, 2.37], more than 1 year: 2.84 mg/dl [95% CI: 1.63, 4.",a892e991-271a-4a34-8c7c-59772a108e68

As for LDL-C levels, possible risks were identified, and are discussed further in the “Harms” section (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 7E and 7F).  mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) reduced the systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP)) for all study periods compared to the control diet, but it was not statistically significant (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 8A). For diastolic blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), there was a statistically significant but minimal decrease only for the study period of more than 6 months to 1 year or less (mean difference: -0.66; 95% CI: − 1.26, − 0.",de7553c6-2c4b-40f5-8511-ea67d8b1aa9e

In mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD), the fasting blood glucose level was significantly decreased by − 1.62 mg/dl (95% CI: − 2.69, − 0.55) compared to the control diet but only for the study period of more than 6 months to 1 year or less (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 9A). In Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD), the fasting blood glucose level did not decrease significantly compared to the control diet, irrespective of the study period (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 9B).",cb66f870-4504-47dc-a3d0-6c7b2d255a6a

Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) showed a decrease in all studies, but it was not statistically significant (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 10D).  Summary and conclusion of benefits  In adults with overweight or obesity, the carbohydrate-restricted diets led to weight loss similar to or greater than that of the control diet. As the proportion of carbohydrates decreased, body weight and body mass index (BMI) reduction became greater. When used for 6 months or less, reduction in body weight and body mass index (BMI) was greatest, and the reduction effect decreased as the study period increased. Compared to the control diet, WC is significantly reduced for the study period of 6 months or less in mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD).",0481198e-b541-4566-abd3-28c81ad72d3f
21,methods25," Compared to the control diet, fat mass was significantly reduced for the study period of more than 6 months to 1 year or less in mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD), and body fat percentage was significantly reduced in Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD). Therefore, a reduction in weight and body mass index (BMI), as well as WC and body fat mass, can be expected through a short-term carbohydrate-restricted diet for 6 months. Additional effects of TG reduction and HDL-C increase for 1 year or less could also be expected.  Harms (risks)  Fat-free mass  While mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) led to decreasing trends in fat-free mass in all studies compared to the control diet, it was not statistically significant (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 11A). Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) significantly decreased the body fat-free mass by 1.05 kg (95% CI: − 1.75, − 0.35) compared to the control diet for a study period of 6 months or less in three studies (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 11B).",d66a6973-4eda-4211-b354-15a5e0cdfcc1

There was limited literature directly describing the adverse events. In some studies, carbohydrate-restricted diets increase the incidence of nausea, vomiting, headache, and constipation, although it was not statistically significant compared to the control diet in a period of 6 months or less (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 12). Although there is no causal relationship with dietary intervention, two cases of death and one case of coronary artery disease occurred five to 10 months after the beginning of research in the low carbohydrate diet group of the two studies.",eef26231-c17e-4222-bfb3-933a7cd07f06
23,methods27,"  Summary and conclusion of harms  In adults with overweight or obesity, Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) has been found to cause a decrease in fat-free mass and an increase in LDL-C level compared to the control diet for the study period of 6 months or less. Moreover, caution is required as carbohydrate-restricted diets tend to increase adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headache during the early period.  Balance of benefits and risks  In adults with overweight or obesity, carbohydrate-restricted diets led to weight loss similar to or greater than that of the control diet, and the effect was greater as the proportion of carbohydrates decreased. Remarkably, the effect was greatest in a short period of 6 months, and the effect decreased as the period increased.

24,methods28," Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) lowered the fat percentage within 1 year, but an increase in LDL-C, along with a decrease in fat-free mass, within 6 months, requires careful discernment on their application. Moreover, caution is required as carbohydrate-restricted diets tended to increase the incidence of nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headaches during the early period.  Considerations in the use of the recommendation  To reduce body weight in adults with overweight or obesity, a balanced and high-quality diet with carbohydrate restriction and reduced caloric intake is recommended. Recent guidelines for obesity management allow the individualized use of a low carbohydrate diet for obesity treatment [5], and most of the carbohydrate-restricted diets included in this study involved a decrease in total calorie intake.  Carbohydrate-restricted diets should reduce total caloric intake while avoiding an increase in saturated and trans-fatty acids intake.",8d70d8b5-b172-40cf-ba85-c01abe5e02a6
25,methods29," In a cohort study examining the association between a carbohydrate-restricted diet and the mortality risk, an animal product-based carbohydrate-restricted diet was associated with increased all-cause mortality both in men and women. In contrast, a vegetable-based carbohydrate-restricted diet was associated with reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality [95].  The results should be interpreted with caution because the types and amount of carbohydrates, fats, and total calories ingested and the control diet vary across studies. The benefits and risks of the long-term use of these dietary regimens are incompletely understood. In addition, it is necessary to consider the dietary patterns in South Korea, characterized by a much higher rate of carbohydrate intake than in other countries, to improve adherence to these regimens.",ba5ef589-51dc-422a-a634-e9884a1593c5
26,methods30,"  Recommendation and evaluation of evidence for intermittent fasting in adults with overweight or obesity  The recommendation for intermittent fasting (IF) in adults with overweight or obesity will be withheld due to the lack of long-term studies and the heterogeneity of previous studies.  Level of evidence  In the meta-analysis, ten articles from eight RCTs were included. The analysis included studies conducted with participants classified as overweight or obese, with body mass index (BMI) of ≥23 kg/m2, which is the Korean obesity criteria, and most participants in the studies had a mean body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2. While the risk of bias in individual studies was generally low (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 13), there was a high risk of bias in several items, including indirectness and imprecision. Therefore, the level of evidence for the overall evaluation indicators was evaluated as “very-low evidence” (Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 7).",c4c41974-5662-4504-a75c-07330aa7d59a
27,methods31,"  Benefits (advantages)  The primary outcomes for assessing the benefit of IF in adults with overweight or obesity included body weight, body mass index (BMI), WC, fat mass, body fat percentage, and fat-free mass. The secondary outcomes included TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).  Body weight, body mass index, and body composition  The intervention group, in whom IF was implemented showed no statistically significant difference in body weight (mean difference: − 1.22 kg; 95% CI: − 3.49, 1.05), body mass index (BMI) (mean difference: − 0.49 kg/m2; 95% CI: − 1.13, 0.14), WC (mean difference: − 1.95 cm; 95% CI: − 4.09, 0.20), fat-free mass (mean difference: − 0.35 kg; 95% CI: − 0.87, 0.18), fat mass (mean difference: − 0.67 kg; 95% CI: − 1.95, 0.62), and fat mass percentage (mean difference: 0.27%; 95% CI: − 0.48, 1.",044f98f3-d6c1-4da4-9ee9-d36207fefd8e

The studies were conducted in a variety of countries and races, and limited studies were conducted on Asians. Due to the nature of diet research, there were many studies in which blinding was not performed or related information was not described, and the dropout rate of the study also varied from 6 to 31%.

In the studies that conducted alternate day fasting, the intervention was mostly performed with a modified IF method that did not perform complete fasting on the day of intermittent fasting but reduced the intake of calories by about 70–75%. As for the dietary method on the day of intake, there were studies that restricted caloric intake, and there were studies that implemented a standard diet. In two studies, time restricted feeding was implemented as an intervention, and these studies also divided the time of the day and implemented different feeding and fasting times of 16:8 and 12:12.  Long-term researches were scarce. The study periods varied from 3 months to a maximum of 1 year, and only one study was conducted for 1 year.

Although less than 50% were diabetic, one study was included in the analysis since the outcomes could be analyzed only for diabetic patients [69, 70]. There were 13 studies on mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) and five studies on Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD). Most studies were conducted in Western countries, and no studies were conducted in South Korea. Five studies were conducted in East Asian countries (China, Japan, and Taiwan), with similar demographic characteristics to South Korea. Of 1282 subjects, 369 (28.8%) were from East Asian countries.

A weight loss of 3.84 kg (95% CI -7.55, − 0.13) was also observed in Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) (five studies). However, no additional benefit was observed for periods exceeding six months.

Hence, mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) and Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) elicit additional weight loss within 6 months in diabetic patients compared to the control diet.  In blood pressure, mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) (seven studies) reduced the systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 2.99 mmHg (95% CI -5.48, − 0.",3d633981-661b-45ac-8b8d-e9f5694c57ad

These results were inconsistent with the meta-analysis results, including more studies in obese adults. Hence, the additional blood pressure-lowering effect of mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) and Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) compared to control diets in diabetic patients is inconclusive.  In lipid profiles, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels were evaluated as outcomes. Compared to the control diets, mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) (11 studies) decrease in TG level by 17.22 mg/dl (95% CI -34.27, − 0.18) within 6 months, and 17.85 mg/dl (95% CI -32.08, − 3.62) for 1 year or less.

Rather, an additional increase in LDL-C level of 7.19 mg/dl (95% CI 0.02, 14.36) was observed within 6 months (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 20). These findings were consistent with the meta-analysis results, including more studies in obese adults. Hence, even in diabetic patients, mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) has additional benefits of improving TG and HDL-C levels within 1 year, whereas Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) has a risk of increasing LDL-C levels within 6 months compared to the control diets.

Summary and conclusion of benefits  In adults with type 2 diabetes, mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) and Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) were more effective in reducing body weight and improving glycemic control than equivalent calorie-restricted diets within 6 months. The benefits were greater in Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) than in mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD). In addition, mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) improved insulin resistance and lipid profile (decreased TG and increased HLD-C levels).  Harms (risks)  Of the 18 studies, eight studies mentioned risks, and five of them stated that there were “no serious adverse events.” Three studies reported adverse events, but they were evaluated to not be associated with the intervention.",324a9f1d-ffb7-4bfe-a428-2fff9588dca5
46,methods53,"  Gastrointestinal disturbance, such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation, tended to increase within a short period but decreased afterward in two Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) studies for the risk assessment in obese adults (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 12) [17, 45].  Hypoglycemia is the most concerning complication of reducing total calorie intake or carbohydrate-restricted diets in diabetic patients. There was no direct evidence that carbohydrate-restricted diets were more likely to cause hypoglycemia than a calorie-restricted diet. However, patients with type 1 diabetes or a history of severe hypoglycemia, or patients using insulin or sulfonylureas at a higher risk of hypoglycemia were also excluded in several studies [38, 45, 51, 59, 67, 74–78]. Furthermore, it is clear that the risk of hypoglycemia increase with a greater degree of carbohydrate or calorie restriction [96]. Indeed, only 2 of 13 mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) studies (15.",e02f820a-7827-4c40-83e4-606dc3b1e58d
47,methods54,"4%) excluded patients at a higher risk of hypoglycemia with type 1 diabetes or those using insulin or sulfonylureas [59, 74–78], compared to 4 of 5 Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) studies (75.0%) [38, 45, 51, 67] in our analysis. Therefore, carbohydrate- or calorie-restricted diets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which was greater in Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD).  LDL-C level was statistically significantly increased by Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) compared to the control diet in the meta-analysis results. These results were consistent with the meta-analysis results, including more studies in obese adults. Hence, Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) is likely to increase the risk of LDL-C.  Summary and conclusion of harms  Many studies excluded patients with a higher risk of hypoglycemia, and this risk is higher as the degree of carbohydrate restriction increases [97]. Therefore, Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) is associated with the highest risk of hypoglycemia.",5d8387c8-9f7d-4348-8d3e-ce7176721968
48,methods55," LDL-C levels, an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, increased significantly in Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) but not in mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD). Diabetes is a significant contributor to cardiovascular disease, and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is two to four times higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes [98]. Therefore, elevated LDL-C in Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  Balance of benefits and harms  In adults with type 2 diabetes, carbohydrate-restricted diets improved glycemic control and reduced body weight to a level similar to or greater than that of the control diets, and the effects were greater as carbohydrate intake decreased. Moreover, the effects were greatest within 6 months and decreased as the intervention period increased. mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) decreased TG, increased HDL-C.",ac3623c0-d9d9-42dc-9fc6-5da1635e0a86
49,methods56," Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) elevated LDL-C and significantly increased the risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, the benefits outweigh the risks in mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) but not in Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD).  Considerations in the use of the recommendation  Participants with malignancies or serious medical conditions in the cardiovascular system, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas; pregnant or lactating women; psychiatric disorders including eating disorders or drug abuse; acute illnesses such as infections, were excluded due to the greater risk of harm in most studies, because carbohydrate-restricted diets have a high potential for harm in such patients and inconclusive benefits. Therefore, it is inappropriate to recommend a carbohydrate-restricted diet to those patients.  Recently popular dietary approaches, such as extremely low carbohydrate and high-fat diets, focus only on lowering the carbohydrate ratio, neglecting the total caloric intake and fat quality.",9ff58141-4fab-473f-a569-2c84f12717ac
50,methods57," Since reducing carbohydrate intake inevitably leads to an increase in fat intake, we should also be concerned about total fat intake and fat quality. Fortunately, the researchers in most studies tried to minimize the increase in fat intake while reducing the total caloric intake included in the analysis. Simultaneously, they attempted to decrease the intake of saturated and trans-fatty acids, with potential harm to cardiovascular disease. Therefore, carbohydrate-restricted diets should reduce total caloric intake while avoiding an increase in the intake of saturated and trans fatty acids.  Since most studies are focused on evaluating the benefits of carbohydrate-restricted diets, with a scarcity of research on risk assessment, further studies are required. Furthermore, well-designed RCTs in Korean patients are also needed.",c0349fb8-b845-4912-8574-3601b8d95eb7
51,methods58," Considering that the carbohydrate intake rate of Koreans is about 65%, which is significantly higher than that of other countries [93], future studies must evaluate 1) whether this benefit can be maintained even after adjusting the carbohydrate restriction rate to 45 ~ 55%, which is higher than that of moderately low carbohydrate diets (MCD), and 2) whether carbohydrate restriction to the level of moderately low carbohydrate diets (MCD) or low carbohydrate diets (LCD) would be harmful to Koreans.

The risk of bias in the study was evaluated as “low” or “some concern” (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. 13). However, there was only one study to be analyzed, the number of subjects was too small, and the effect of outcome was insufficient, with apparent imprecision. After rating down, the level of evidence for the change in HbA1c level was evaluated as “low evidence”.

Balance of benefits and harms  In adults with type 2 diabetes, IF has no evidence of benefit for metabolic outcomes such as glycemic control and weight loss, and no evidence of harm has been identified. However, there is a high risk of harm such as hypoglycemia during the fasting period. In conclusion, this committee decided that IF was a “strong recommendation against” in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Considerations in the use of the recommendation  Additional research is needed to establish sufficient evidence, considering the continuing and high interest in IF as an attractive diet regimen among the general population with some studies publishing beneficial results.",93bd6e79-72e2-44f9-a74d-a68f8e91b282

In the meta-analysis, 14 articles from six RCTs on benefit were included. There were three studies each on both mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) and Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD).

Therefore, the level of evidence was downgraded to “very-low evidence” (Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 9).  Intermittent fasting  There have been no studies on the benefits of IF conducted on the included studies. Therefore, the evidence for IF was not evaluated.

Balance of benefits and risks  For obese adults with hypertension, carbohydrate-restricted diets had no additional benefit in reducing blood pressure and weight compared to calorie-restricted or low fat diets when maintained for 1 year or longer. While TG levels decreased within 1 year, such a benefit reduced after 1 year. There was a risk of increasing LDL-C for less than 1 year in Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD), but thereafter, the risk disappeared.

Therefore, the selection of such methods should be made by fully considering the potential benefits and risks according to the condition of each patient.

Considerations in the use of the recommendation  Further research is needed to establish the evidence, as there is insufficient evidence to prove the effectiveness of low carbohydrate diets (LCD) in adults with hypertension, and there are no randomized controlled trials targeting only patients with hypertension, with no studies presenting the change in blood pressure as a primary outcome.  Conclusions  Our committee decided that mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) is a conditional recommendation as a dietary regimen for reducing body weight in adults with overweight or obesity and for improving glycemic control and reducing body weight in adults with type 2 diabetes. In contrast, Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) and IF are recommended to avoid for adults with type 2 diabetes.  Supplementary Information  Additional file 1. Supplementary Table 1.

73,results0," Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested. In adults with overweight or obesity, a moderately-low carbohydrate or low carbohydrate diet (mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD)) can be considered as a dietary regimen for weight reduction. In adults with type 2 diabetes, mlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) can be considered as a dietary regimen for improving glycemic control and reducing body weight. In contrast, a very-low carbohydrate diet (Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD)) and IF are recommended against in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, no recommendations are suggested for Vlow carbohydrate diets (LCD) and IF in adults with overweight or obesity, and carbohydrate-restricted diets and IF in patients with hypertension.

74,results1,"  Keywords  Obesity Diabetes mellitus Hypertension Diet Carbohydrate National Academy of Medicine of Koreaissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2022 ==== Body pmcIntroduction  Obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypertension are the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease and are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality [1–4]. Structured dietary intervention plays a crucial role in preventing and managing these cardiometabolic diseases. Major clinical practice guidelines commonly recommend losing more than 5% of body weight and reducing total caloric intake [5–8]. Nevertheless, reducing total caloric intake enough to lose weight requires tremendous effort, and maintaining it over the long term is much more challenging. Alternatively, carbohydrate-restricted diets and intermittent fasting (IF) are emerging as relatively easy and effective popular dietary regimens for reducing body weight [9].",5da90d49-3aa7-45bd-b8cc-d62a065bd3c7
75,results2,"  Carbohydrates make up more than half of an individual’s calorie intake, and restricting them can be critical in reducing total calories and body weight [10]. Obesity, T2DM, and hypertension constitute metabolic syndrome, and glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are major contributors to the pathogenesis of these diseases [11]. Reducing carbohydrate that is absorbed in the form of glucose or fructose and leading to immediate hyperglycemia may help prevent and improve these conditions [12]. However, clinical evidence on the benefits and harms of carbohydrate-restricted diets in these diseases remains insufficient [5–8].  IF is a generic term for a variety of eating methods involving fasting for different periods, such as several hours a day, 1 day every several days, or several days a week [13].",35fa7361-f8e2-42c5-be6b-fe0d855d80c3
76,results3," In some studies, IF is known to be effective in preventing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and degenerative brain disease, as well as weight loss in overweight or obese people [14]. However, these studies were conducted for a short period with a small number of subjects, and results were heterogeneous among studies [14]. Moreover, since most studies evaluated effects in healthy adults, applying the impact on patients with cardiometabolic diseases such as morbid obesity, diabetes, and hypertension is challenging [15].  For these reasons, the principal clinical practice guidelines for managing obesity, T2DM, and hypertension do not provide specific recommendations for carbohydrate-restricted diets or IF [5–8]. Notably, the dietary approaches that lack evidence for benefits but are potentially harmful are rapidly spreading to the public without clear guidance from experts.",e010d91e-9087-47f7-8331-127decb27560
77,results4," Therefore, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis and systematic literature review to examine the benefits and harms of these dietary regimens in adults with obesity, T2DM, and hypertension and develop recommendations based on the high-level evidence by the results.
