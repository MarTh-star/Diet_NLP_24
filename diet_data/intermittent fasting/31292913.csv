0,introduction0,"Circadian rhythms are mental, physical, and behavioral changes that follow a daily cycle, which respond primarily to light and darkness in an organism's environment [1]. Circadian rhythm has a direct effect on metabolic processes and the regulation of energy balance [2]. Certain behaviors such as the timing of food abstinence and intake may affect circadian rhythms [3–6]. Levels of cortisol, melatonin, ghrelin, and leptin are highly correlated with circadian rhythmicity; the levels of these hormones are affected by sleep, feeding, and general behaviors, and fluctuate according to the light-dark cycle [7].  Recurrent circadian fasting during Ramadan is a form of diurnal intermittent fasting (diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF)) or time-restricted feeding that is practiced by more than 1.5 billion Muslims every year. This special form of religious fasting is characterized by its duration and continuity (no break between fasting days) [8–11].",28b00bdb-960a-4951-a5b0-f1752df5fd8b
1,introduction1," Such type of fasting involves complete abstinence from food and drink, even water, from dawn to sunset. During Ramadan, several changes have been reported in dietary habits, meal frequency, and timing [12–14], and sleep patterns [15, 16]. The extent of these changes differs culturally and is associated with variable intakes of fatty and sweet foods and beverages [17, 18]. Such dietary changes are resulting in variable effects on body composition [10], metabolic syndrome components [19], genetic expressions [11], and oxidative stress and inflammatory markers [20].  During diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) of Ramadan, two to three meals are consumed after sunset: a light meal or breakfast at the moment of declaration of sunset prayer time (Athan Al-Maghrib), dinner following nightly prayer in some countries (about one to three hours after sunset), and a predawn meal (Suhur).",76916218-66d3-49a7-a4c1-b4c167a5218b
2,introduction2," People in other countries take one large meal at the sunset breakfast and another meal pre-dawn, with several snacks and sweets in the hours between these mealtimes. In both cases, food consumption times are shifted to nighttime hours. This sudden and drastic shift in the timing of food intake partly inverts the normal circadian patterns, leading to a disruption of the biological clocks and rhythms of fasting people [4]. Both feeding and sleep/wake cycles are under strict hypothalamic control. As such, abnormal patterns in one axis may affect the other, resulting in metabolic dysfunction [21]. Increasing caloric intake at night may affect the circadian rhythm and result in a loss of the temporal control (circadian disruption) of metabolic processes during fasting [22, 23], as circadian rhythms are impacted by the timing of meals and blood glucose levels [24–26].",904f5609-4e23-4bf4-b199-13649479124e
3,introduction3,"  During the diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) of Ramadan, drastic changes in the timing and frequency of fluid and food intake have been reported [27], which contribute to chronobiological changes in the circadian rhythms that regulate body temperature, blood glucose, cortisol, and melatonin levels, and day- and night-time wakefulness [22]. Bogdan and colleagues have previously reported that diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) during Ramadan, along with the concomitant changes in social habits, psychology, and sleep schedules induce changes in the rhythmicity of levels of several hormones such as cortisol, melatonin, and leptin [28, 29]; however, the authors did not account for the body weight of the study participants, nor did they examine how changes in anthropometric measures, diet, and lifestyle during Ramadan impact these hormonal changes.",b56138c8-0af5-484d-a12c-f7f20f93dfcd
4,introduction4,"  To date, no study has assessed changes in the concentrations of these hormones in overweight/obese subjects throughout the fasting month of Ramadan. Thus, it was prudent to determine whether obese subjects differed from lean subjects in terms of changes in circadian rhythmicity during the fasting month of Ramadan. Changes in sleep and circadian rhythmicity are associated with obesity and its related biochemical, anthropometric, and dietary markers [30, 31]. It was hypothesized that the practice of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) during Ramadan, with its accompanying dietary and lifestyle changes, would variably affect the levels of hormones that regulate feeding patterns, stress responses, and sleep among overweight and obese subjects.",90dceed9-75a5-40d4-8722-556f20ecb226
5,introduction5," Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effect of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) during Ramadan on serum levels of ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, and salivary cortisol levels in a group of overweight and obese subjects, and to determine how anthropometric, dietary, and lifestyle changes correlate with hormonal fluctuations.

6,methods0,"Subjects The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sharjah (Reference no: REC-16-05-11-01) and was carried out in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All enrolled subjects provided written informed consent before starting the study. Subjects were recruited using social media outlets. The participation was completely voluntary, with no monetary or non-monetary incentives were given to the participants. All the subjects were Arab residents living in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (United Arab Emirates (UAE)). A total of 64 subjects visiting the University Hospital of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were screened. The inclusion criteria were adult male or female Muslims who were overweight or obese (Body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2) who were willing to fast during the month of Ramadan. We excluded subjects with a history of endocrine or cardiovascular diseases or diabetes.",b9877024-ded8-4150-a78d-0058fd580462
7,methods1," We also excluded subjects who took any prescribed medication one week before Ramadan and excluding those who took any medication during the study period. Moreover, pregnant women, any subject enrolled in a weight-management program within the month before Ramadan, and those with a history of bariatric surgery were excluded.  None of the study subjects reported having had sleep problems and all participants had a regular sleep/wake schedule. Criteria of regular sleep/wake schedule include the lack of erratic sleep patterns, and having a fixed schedule of sleep/awake without continuous interruptions, thus enabling meeting the body needed sleep hours each day, and avoiding feeling with daytime sleepiness. No subjects were participating in any dietary program before the start of the study, nor were any practicing fasting as routine, voluntary rituals before the month of Ramadan.",cd2899a2-2d45-4a04-9e17-a3a6388e998a
8,methods2,"  Study design This prospective study was conducted one week before and during Ramadan of the lunar year (1438 Hijri) from May 26th to June 27th 2017. Data were collected one week before Ramadan (baseline, or T1) and at the end of the fourth week of Ramadan (after completing 28 consecutive days of fasting, or T2). During Ramadan, study subjects abstained from all food and drink (including water) from dawn to sunset. The daily fasting duration during this study was approximately 15 h. Each participant served as his/her internal control, as each subject’s values before Ramadan (T1) were compared to those at the end of Ramadan (T2). No special dietary recommendations were given to the study subjects, and all participants were instructed to continue their regular diet during non-fasting hours. Notably, females are exempted from fasting during Ramadan while menstruating.",bb4d0d8f-dd21-4295-9bcb-9ec8f88ab9b8
9,methods3," Thus, the fasting period for pre-menopausal female subjects ranged from 23 to 25 days, whereas the fasting period for the male subjects ranged from 28 to 30 days. Since physical exercise may interfere with the subjects’ body compositions and biochemical measurements by the end of Ramadan, study subjects were instructed not to alter their habitual physical exercise levels before or during Ramadan.  Anthropometric assessment One week before the month of Ramadan (T1), subjects were assessed in the late morning (11:00 am-1:00 pm) after fasting for eight to ten hours. At the end of the month of Ramadan (T2), subjects were again evaluated in the late morning (11:00 am-1:00 pm) after fasting for eight to ten hours following the previous night’s meal (Suhur). Bodyweight and body composition (including visceral fat assessment) were evaluated, and blood samples were drawn at the two-time points (T1 and T2). Body weight was measured in light clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg (±0.",fc657e9c-7450-4459-890b-84a352c6491c
10,methods4,"1 kg) using a balance beam scale (Detecto, Webb City, MO, USA). Fat mass, fat-free mass, and total body water were measured using direct segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (DSM-BIA) (Tanita MC-980, Tokyo, Japan). Validation and high accuracy of DSM-BIA in the quantification of total body and segmental body composition had been reported elsewhere [32, 33]. As per the manufacturer’s instructions, all accessories, metals, and/or jewelry were removed before conducting BIA, and each subject was instructed to excrete excess bodily fluids through urination before conducting the BIA measurements. As all subjects were fasting for eight to ten hours before each of the two-time points, the impact of hydration and physical exercise on BIA measurements was minimized, thus reducing intra-individual variability. Height was measured without shoes or head cover using a wall-mounted stadiometer (±0.1 cm).",d1056869-2338-4134-9b89-df59f2e026ce
11,methods5," Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on each subject’s height and weight. Waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) were measured to the nearest 1.0 cm using a non-stretchable measuring tape (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Neck circumference was measured in the midway of the neck, between the mid-cervical spine and mid anterior neck, to within 1 mm, with non-stretchable plastic tape with the subjects standing upright. In men with a laryngeal prominence (Adam's apple), it was measured just below the prominence [34].  Blood sampling and lipid and hormone assays Venous blood (10 mL) samples were collected after measuring blood pressure. Venipuncture collection was done after eight to ten hours of fasting at both time points (the baseline, T1, and at the end of the fourth week of Ramadan, T2, between 11:00 am and 1:00 pm for both timepoints) to minimize the effect of time on the measured variables.",5fc13404-2ca4-4367-a1c8-daca359a5145
12,methods6," Coded blood samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C within an hour of their collection, then aliquoted and stored at -80°C until analysis. Serum ghrelin (USCN, CEA99IHu), leptin (Arigo Biolaboratories, ARG80831, EO7), melatonin (Abcam, Ab213978), and salivary cortisol (Salimetrics, ER HS 1–3002) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A fully automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Adaltis Pchem1, Rome, Italy) was used to quantify fasting plasma glucose levels and serum lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides). Blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate were measured using a digital blood pressure monitor (GE Healthcare, Chicago, USA), with subjects in a seated position after five minutes of rest before drawing blood.",7c6d06d4-69dc-46f7-bde1-416f195b6c09
13,methods7,"  Unstimulated saliva was collected and processed according to the Salimetrics manufacture manual. For saliva collection, the fasting donors already came while avoided eating, drinking, and smoking, and were instructed not to use oral hygiene products for at least 1 hour before their hospital visit. Spit samples were collected by asking volunteers to forcefully spit saliva (not sputum) into the sterile plastic saliva collection containers through direct spitting. The collected samples were centrifuged at 1500 gx for 15 min at 4°C within one hour of saliva collection. After centrifuge, the supernatants were immediately separated by sterile pipettes, aliquoted into smaller volumes, and stored at -80°C deep freezer until used for cortisol assay. To avoid hormone degradation thawed saliva samples were used once.",324cd4e2-b1d0-4c27-9094-aa2cb73f1e76
14,methods8,"  Dietary intake assessment Dietary intake was assessed by the 24-hour recall on three days (one weekend day and two weekdays) at the two-time points (T1 and T2) by trained nutritionists. Two-dimensional food models were used to help the study subjects determine approximate portion sizes. Dietary caloric and macronutrient intakes were estimated using The Food Processor software, version 10.6 (ESHA Research, Salem, OR, USA). Validity and reliability of 24-hour recall in assessing dietary and caloric intake are reported elsewhere [35–37].  Physical activity assessment General physical activity levels were assessed using the Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Reference for Dietary Planning and Assessment classification system developed by the Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, USA [38].",58a0962b-e6af-4c88-8edb-f81b1699f21d
15,methods9," The activity level was considered sedentary when the participant tended to spend most of the daytime hours performing basic daily life activities without being engaged in any additional physical exercise. The activity level was considered low when the participant spent the daytime hours performing daily life activities in addition to spending 30–60 minutes a day engaged in moderate-intensity physical exercise (3–6 metabolic equivalents, METs). An active participant was one whose daytime hours were spent performing daily life activities in addition to spending at least 60 minutes a day performing moderate-intensity physical exercise. A very active participant was one whose daytime hours were spent performing daily life activities in addition to at least 120 minutes a day of moderate-intensity physical exercises or 60 minutes of vigorous exercises (>6 METs) [38].",ae74dc9f-c105-4c3e-ae3b-a81750df08b8
16,methods10,"  Sleep duration Total sleep duration (hours/day) was assessed using the Sleep Pattern questions of the Stanford Health Care Sleep Questionnaire before and at the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.  Statistical analyses Analyses were conducted and results were reported following Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)) guidelines [39]. The primary outcome measures were the changes in concentrations of the four hormones between the pre-fasting baseline and post-fasting timepoints. From a power analysis, we calculated that 51 subjects would be required to provide 80% power to detect a significant difference of 5% in hormonal changes between the baseline and post-fasting time points, using a two-tailed, paired-samples t-test with α = 0.05. We estimated a dropout rate of 10%. Thus, we planned to enroll a total of 57 subjects. The statistical analyses were performed using Stata software (v.13.1 StataCorp., TX, USA).",650cf8c4-ffa1-4acd-a776-29cc244b61da
17,methods11," Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Two-tailed paired sample t-tests were used to compare within-subject changes from baseline. Spearman’s correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationships between the concentrations of the four hormones and age, sex, sleep duration, and dietary intake. Differences were considered significant at P< 0.05. ",f095e71a-efd7-4329-9fdb-6c6883127b00

22,discussion0,"  Comment 51: This section needs to discuss the study findings in more depth. A comparison with previous studies should be more comprehensive. In the case of cortisol, for example, some important papers on changes in cortisol circadian rhythm have not been mentioned.  Response:   Previous studies on Ramadan fasting and cortisol levels exhibited contradicting results (Al-Hadramy, Zawawi, et al. 1988, Bahijri, Borai, et al. 2013), which may be ascribed to the different time points and along with different eating and sleep patterns of the fasting participants. See page 17, lines 425-427.   Comment 52: In the case of leptin, as mentioned above, statistical analysis should look into whether changes in leptin with Ramadan fasting are weight and body, fat independent.

32,discussion10," The previous studies showed that the effect of Ramadan on these two hormones was an increase by night and a decrease in the morning. So the experimental design of this study will not allow knowing the real effect of Ramadan on melatonin or cortisol.

However, the time of saliva collection is already mentioned (11:00 am-1:00 pm). See page 7, line 179-180.    Comment 78: Authors did not study the circadian rhythm, so in the first paragraph line 6, authors could not write: “circadian rhythms such as ghrelin, leptin, and melatonin were significantly reduced at the end of the fasting. To do such a study authors need several sampling time a cross the 24H.   Response: This statement has been corrected in the discussion.",2c9f05c7-eb5d-419e-a2c6-e693b487fa2c
33,discussion11," It reads now as: ""Further, serum levels of the hormones leptin, ghrelin, and melatonin were significantly reduced at the end of the fasting month compared to the pre-fasting state"". Page 14, lines 338-339.  Comment 79: About change in melatonin, authors compared Ramadan fasting and experimental one and cited the ref 37. This reference is not about experimental fasting and could not be used to argue this comparison.  Response: Comparison should be with the results of the same design. Our study is observational, not experimental, in nature. Reference 37 (BaHammam. J Sleep Biol Rhythm 2004) was not experimental fasting. It was an observational study on volunteers during Ramadan intermittent fasting.   Comment 80: This study did not give a reliable result about melatonin; since this hormone is secreted by night and it is normally very low by day. So we don’t expect reliable result if we study it with one time point in the morning.",64579c22-3e7a-4442-a3fb-69379c63713d
34,discussion12,"  Response: A limitation of this study is the single measurement of hormones, which was stressed in the limitation section of the paper. See page 18-19, lines 455-466.   Comment 81: I recommend to the authors to reduce the part reserved in the discussion to cortisol and melatonin. Specially that this study did not use the appropriate time to measure these 2 hormones.   Response: Paragraphs related to the discussion of cortisol and melatonin are reduced.  Comment 82: Paragraph 4 line 4 : ref 31 not appropriate because not related to intermittent fasting.   Response: Changed (Muller, Lamberts, et al. 2002). See page 16, line 392.   Comment 83: The conclusion must be changed. It did not reflect the result. For example the result showed significant correlations between some variables  Response: The conclusion is changed.
