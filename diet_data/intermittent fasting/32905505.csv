However, whether inter‐organ systems play a key role in IF remains unclear. Here, a novel hepatokine, pregnancy zone protein (pregnancy zone protein (PZP)) is identified, which has significant induction during the refeeding stage of IF. Further, loss of function studies and protein therapeutic experiment in mice revealed that pregnancy zone protein (PZP) promotes diet‐induced thermogenesis through activating brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue (BAT)). Mechanistically, circulating pregnancy zone protein (PZP) can bind to cell surface glucose‐regulated protein of 78 kDa (GRP78) to promote uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression via a p38 MAPK‐ATF2 signaling pathway in brown adipose tissue (BAT).",af0e4c68-9832-4542-aa11-70bab30c7a03

As a consequence, many metabolic disorders result from this increase in adipocyte size (hypertrophy).[ 2 ]  In contrast with white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue (BAT)), which owns multi‐ocular lipid droplets and numerous mitochondria, can uncouple substrate oxidation from ATP production into heat by utilizing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).",0e90eca8-ded1-4e35-b707-2eb14fed0741

It gained increasing attentions due to easier handling and remarkable ability to sustain weight loss.[ 8 ] Several researches have proved that IF could elevate energy expenditure to reduce weight[ 9 , 10 , 11 ] However, their molecular mechanisms involved in IF mainly focused on the adipose tissue itself, and it is still unclear whether there are inter‐organ communications playing a role in IF.",63479c76-b666-4a0d-93ba-49c97462c8c4

FGF21 was found to participate in the regulation of UCP1 expression of adipose tissue to promote energy expenditure.[ 14 ] Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), as a novel hepatokine, could regulate muscle glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity through low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein‐2 (LRP2)‐dependent mechanism.[ 15 ] Considering the high sensitivity of the liver to metabolic changes during fasting and refeeding, we propose that liver secretory factors can promote energy expenditure, which contributes to the benefits of IF.",743e6164-f7c9-4097-b56a-3147766e4d08
