0,methods0,"4.1. Animals Female MRL/lpr mice were purchased from SLC Inc. (Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) and randomized into a control group (n = 6) and an intermittent fasting group (IF; n = 8). MRL/lpr mice were sacrificed at 28 weeks of age. Control mice had unrestricted access to food. Mice in the IF group were fed every other day (food pellets were provided or removed at 9 am) between 10 and 28 weeks of age. Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from OrientBio (Sungnam, Korea). C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age and used as healthy control (n = 4). All procedure of animal research were provided in accordance with the Laboratory Animals Welfare Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guidelines and Policies for Rodent experiment provided by the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) in School of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea (approval number: CUMS-2020–0071-03 and CUMS-2020–0031-02).  4.2.",ac1780a4-e8ec-488c-9c5d-70271cbb5de6
1,methods1," Measurement of Serum Antibodies and Cytokine Anti-dsDNA antibody levels were measured in 1:5000 dilutions of sera by ELISA (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total IgG and IgG2a levels were measured in 1:100,000 dilutions of sera by ELISA (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IFN-γ levels were measured in 1:10 dilutions of sera by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  4.3. Measurement of Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio Spot urine samples were collected by urinary bladder massage of each mouse at 8 and 28 weeks of age. Urine albumin and creatinine concentrations were measured using a mouse albumin ELISA assay (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) and a creatinine assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s directions.",3d3a1342-00c2-488c-9115-13edced914c8
2,methods2," Urine albumin excretion was expressed as the ratio of urine albumin to creatinine.  4.4. Immunofluorescence Microscopy Sections of kidney tissues were incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-mouse IgG (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-mouse C3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or anti-mouse nephrin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), washed, and incubated with anti-rat, anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 for 2 h. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA). Control sections were treated in the same manner except that rat, rabbit, or mouse IgG were used in place of the primary antibodies. Confocal microscopy was performed and images were acquired using an LSM 800 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Ten renal glomeruli areas were examined and averaged.  4.5.",120da61d-7028-43b2-8416-e31e9089a98f
3,methods3," Histologic Assessment of Kidney Sections of kidney tissues were stained with periodic acid–Schiff (periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)) reagent (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and analyzed using a digital camera (MedICAM-k; COMART system, Seoul, Korea) attached to an Olympus BX41 microscope. Kidney pathology was evaluated using the standard lupus nephritis classification system [46].  4.6. Flow Cytometry Spleens were minced in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer to prepare single-cell suspensions. Tibias were dissected under sterile conditions to expose the bone marrow cavity, which was then rinsed with RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were surface-stained with eFluor780-fixable viability dye (fixable viability dye (FVD)) (eBioscience, Carlsbad, CA, USA), Pacific Blue-conjugated anti-CD90.2 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), allophycocyanin (allophycocyanin (APC))-conjugated anti-CD19 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), PerCP-Cy5.",3bbc6abd-9def-41e3-bf30-5643e2e8fad3
4,methods4,"5-conjugated GL7 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), and/or PE-conjugated anti-CD138 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) antibodies. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-p62 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or isotype antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA) followed by an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells were analyzed using a BD LSRII Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).  4.7. Chloroquine Treatment of Cultured Cells Splenocytes or bone marrow cells from the IF group were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well and incubated for 24 h with or without chloroquine 50 μM (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).",60b707cc-48ab-493e-a88b-80a4cedf0dab
5,methods5," The culture supernatants were then collected for measurement of anti-dsDNA antibody and total IgG concentration as described above.  4.8. Western Blot Analysis Spleen samples were lysed in RIPA buffer containing Halt protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA) and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. Samples of lysate equivalent to 20 μg of protein were separated by 10% or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with Bovine Serum Albumin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated with the following primary antibodies; anti-MCL1 (Proteintech, Chicago, IL, USA), anti-BCL2 (Bioss Biotechnology, Beijing, China), anti-BAX (Bioss Biotechnology), or anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 15 h at 4 °C.",c6f0624c-a961-4e9a-bfbd-71fd8f2c219b
6,methods6," The membranes were washed again and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA), or mouse anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Bound proteins were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA), and the membranes were analyzed using an Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).  4.9. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v.8.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was determined by the Mann–Whitney U test, by Wilcoxon test, or by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
