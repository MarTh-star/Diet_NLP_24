0,methods0," The protocol of this study was registered with Open Science Framework (OSF)9 (eAppendix in the Supplement). This umbrella review reported following the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta analyses (PRISMA)) reporting guideline.  Search Strategy and Eligibility Criteria  We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews from inception to January 12, 2021, to identify meta-analyses of RCTs (eTable 1 in the Supplement). No language restriction was applied. Identified articles were imported to EndNote and duplicates were removed. Two reviewers (C.P. and K.R.) independently performed screening of titles and abstracts for relevance and selected studies after examining the full text of the potentially eligible articles. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion with the third reviewer (S.K.V.).",bd06c5c7-9b9a-4d37-9b5f-465519e886ba
1,methods1,"  To be included, the studies met the following criteria: meta-analyses of RCTs investigating associations of IF with obesity-related health outcomes among adults with or without any medical conditions in comparison with any comparators including continuous energy restriction or regular diet. When more than 1 meta-analysis was available for the same research question, we selected the meta-analysis with the largest data set, as previously described.10,11,12 We excluded articles without full text, reviews, and meta-analyses of studies with other study designs and those without a control group.",3e585016-f55b-4d11-9224-2ba21f98c2ce
2,methods2,"  Types of IF included in this review were (1) zero-calorie alternate-day fasting (zero-calorie ADF), which involved alternating days of fasting with zero caloric intake and days of ad libitum eating; (2) modified alternate-day fasting (modified alternate day fasting (MADF)), which alternated between days of ad libitum eating and days of fasting with total caloric intake ranging from 0% to 40% or 0 to 600 kcal per day for 3 to 5 days per week; (3) the 5:2 diet, in which participants fasted for 1 to 2 days per week (either consecutively and nonconsecutively) with total caloric intake ranging from 0% to 40% or 0 to 600 kcal per day and 5 days of ad libitum eating; and (4) time-restricted eating (time restricted eating (TRE)), which involved fasting for 12 to 24 hours per day.13,14  Data Extraction and Quality Assessment  Data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by 2 reviewers (K.R. and V.C.) and checked by other 2 reviewers (C.P. and S.K.V.",4c4ba0c3-c30e-431f-815e-d614deacb68a
3,methods3,") (eMethods in the Supplement). Discrepancies were resolved with consensus. The quality of meta-analyses was assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) and graded as high, moderate, low, or critically low.15  Data Synthesis  Effect sizes were categorized based on the population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes to create a list of unique associations with IF. For each outcome associated with IF in a meta-analysis, we recalculated the effect sizes as mean difference (MD) with corresponding 95% CIs using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model.16 P < .05 was considered statistically significant in 2-sided tests. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics.17 The evidence for small-study effects was assessed by Egger regression asymmetry test.18 P < .10 was taken as statistical evidence of the presence of small-study effects. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.0 (StataCorp).",efddf36d-64c4-41c6-9e07-eebac8e34f24
4,methods4,"  We assessed the quality of evidence per effect provided in a meta-analysis by applying the GRADE criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) in 5 domains including (1) risk of bias in the individual studies, (2) inconsistency, (3) indirectness, (4) imprecision, and (5) publication bias.19 We graded the strength of evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) using GRADEpro version 3.6.1 (McMaster University).  Sensitivity Analyses  We performed sensitivity analyses by excluding primary studies having a high risk of bias rated by the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs and excluding small-size studies (<25th percentile) from the identified associations.20,21 ",1fd7dc8f-1c42-4dde-abc7-624af3fe0e3d

Strength of evidence of the 104 associations assessed using GRADE found that a majority of associations were supported by very low strength of evidence (75 associations [72%]), while the remaining associations were supported by low (22 associations [21%]), moderate (6 associations [6%]), and high level of evidence (1 association [1%]), respectively. There were 28 out of 104 associations (27%) that were statistically significant based on a random-effects model, of which 17 were supported by a very low level of evidence (61%), followed by low (5 associations [18%]), moderate (5 associations [18%]), and high (1 association [4%]) levels of evidence, respectively.",41702108-5d39-4ac7-83f9-148de886c89f

In participants with obesity, body weight was found to be significantly decreased by 1.67 kg (95% CI, −2.79 to −0.55) following 3 months of the 5:2 diet. Afterwards, body weight was sustained (MD, −0.14 kg; 95% CI, −1.26 to 0.98) following 6 to 12 months.27 modified alternate day fasting (MADF) was also found to be associated with improvement of several cardiometabolic risk factors in the first 2 to 12 months including LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. However, small amounts of fat-free mass could be lost in the first 6 months of IF. For example, fat-free mass loss (−0.",d24918a5-f4a1-4967-8026-32d70d83d16d

When removing RCTs with a high risk of bias (measuring 7 outcomes) with very low to low quality evidence, the strength of evidence of 2 associations was upgraded to moderate. These associations were (1) the use of modified alternate day fasting (MADF) for 1 to 3 months and the reduction of body weight in overweight adults compared with regular diet, continuous energy restriction, or time restricted eating (TRE) (MD, −2.55 kg; 95% CI, −4.43 to −0.",0a8ab2de-bb81-42f4-8258-5786e5787c79

20,discussion0," To our knowledge, this study is the first umbrella review that systematically assessed the potential obesity-related health outcomes associated with different types of IF across a large spectrum of published meta-analyses of RCTs and evaluated the evidence by using well-recognized GRADE criteria. Our findings are important in the context of the scarcity of evidence-based support for IF that can be used to generate recommendations for clinicians and the general population. We repeated each meta-analysis with a standardized approach of random-effects analysis to allow better comparison across outcomes. We used standard approaches to assess the quality of methods of the included meta-analyses. We performed sensitivity analyses and provided additional evidence from high-quality RCTs, thus further increasing the reliability of the results.  Our findings suggest that IF is associated with successful weight loss and metabolic benefits among adults with obesity.",b2de896b-a1ca-4d01-9bc6-c0c77c9f2ed1
21,discussion1," modified alternate day fasting (MADF) and the 5:2 diet were the only IF types that were associated with statistically significant weight loss of more than 5% in adults with overweight or obesity. In contrast, zero-calorie ADF, time restricted eating (TRE), and RF did not. IF as a weight loss approach was found to be mostly successful in the initial phase (ie, 1-6 months), after which participants would frequently experience a plateau as additional weight loss was not further achieved because of the metabolic adaptation of the human body or decreased adherence to the assigned weight loss strategy.29,30,31  We identified 104 associations and found significant beneficial outcomes associated with IF on BMI, body weight, fat mass, LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mostly in adults with overweight or obesity. IF was associated with reduced fat-free mass in adults with overweight or obesity.",19390c35-1d2a-4e1e-b6e6-8b05a19f756e
22,discussion2," Only 1 effect among 28 statistically significant associations was supported by high-quality evidence in the main and sensitivity analyses, namely, the association of modified alternate day fasting (MADF) for 1 to 2 months with reduced BMI in healthy adults and adults with overweight, obesity, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) compared with regular diet. Moderate quality of evidence also existed for an association between modified alternate day fasting (MADF) and reduced BMI and fat-free mass in adults with overweight and/or obesity compared with continuous energy restriction. The other 2 associations had a moderate quality of evidence, namely, the use of zero-calorie ADF for the reduction of fat mass and the 5:2 diet for the reduction of fasting insulin in adults with overweight or obesity compared with continuous energy restriction and/or regular diet.",afdb116d-e6cf-42e9-8d47-391671feb577
23,discussion3,"  Most associations were rated as very serious in the domain of risk of bias in the individual studies according to the GRADE criteria. Associations were finally rated as high risk of bias partly because of the lack of masking participants and personnel, which could have influenced treatment allocation and outcome measurement between groups. Understandably, masking could not be appropriately performed in RCTs of IF since 2 different dietary strategies were compared.  In real-life clinical settings, IF has not been widely adopted for many reasons, including heterogeneity in techniques of IF, lack of outcome data, lack of awareness, and presumed difficulty in adherence to the regime. However, several medical conditions show promise with IF, mostly related to metabolism such as diabetes and fatty liver disease. One trial32 for diabetes and 2 trials33,34 for fatty liver disease are available.",1339d158-2822-4e6c-81f5-5d5d87e2ebc6
24,discussion4," For the diabetes trial,32 137 adults were randomized into either IF (2 days per week) (70 participants) or continuous energy restriction (67 participants) with outcomes of glycemic control and weight loss over 12 months. IF was found as noninferior to continuous energy restriction for both outcomes. For the fatty liver trials, both employed ADF for 8 to 12 weeks, but with Johari et al33 the control was normal habitual diet and with Cai et al34 it was time-restricted feeding. Johari et al reported reductions in BMI, alanine aminotransferase levels, steatosis and fibrosis between groups, and with Cai et al significant reductions in weight and dyslipidemia were observed with ADF. For both fatty liver trials, adherence to ADF was surprisingly good (75% to 97.5%). IF may positively affect metabolic conditions because it is associated with beneficial outcomes in anthropometric measures, as demonstrated in the current review.",2716bfc9-7190-4fc1-bbe2-67e9109bd427
25,discussion5," However, the benefits of IF are likely extending beyond weight since reduction is usually modest (ie, 2% to 10%) and thus other mechanisms are probably involved. Exact mechanisms are not entirely clear since studies are limited, but autophagy allowing liver regeneration may be important. A study suggests that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α activation from fasting promoted degradation of nuclear receptor co-pressor 1 and liver autophagy.35  To date, IF trials were mostly conducted with healthy adults and adults with overweight, obesity, or metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and were limited to surrogate anthropometric and cardiometabolic parameters with relatively short follow-up period.",aef66ac3-6343-4743-8e02-1eba500dec5b
26,discussion6," Therefore, more trials are needed to investigate the association of IF with: (1) a broader range of populations such as adolescents, persons older than 65 years, cancer patients, and those with metabolic derangements (eg, polycystic ovarian syndrome and thyroid disorder), (2) clinical outcomes such as liver outcomes, cancer, cardiovascular events, type 2 diabetes remission, and prevention of type 2 diabetes development from prediabetes, (3) gut microbiome and the association with improved health outcomes, and (4) short- and long-term safety outcomes such as adverse events (eg, gastrointestinal, neurological, and hematological), eating disorder syndrome, sleep parameters, reproductive hormones, fertility, and thyroid hormones. This broader scope of studies would further examine the role of IF in a clinical setting.  Our review generated several key messages that should be highly relevant to clinicians and patients, especially those who have interest in adopting the practice of IF.",065fa17a-3425-4a99-b11d-dde23155e99d
27,discussion7," It is important to highlight that there is a paucity of evidence demonstrating clear and sustainable clinical benefits of IF, despite a number of mechanisms to support their benefits in both adults with comorbidities and healthy individuals.1,3 Another aspect that deserves attention is the lack of continuity of IF practice in these trials. This challenge will be even greater in a situation of real-world practice. Implementation research investigating strategies to facilitate the adherence of such practice is also warranted. Therefore, this lack of evidence underlines a strong need of well-designed studies to investigate long-term efficacy and safety outcomes of IF.  Limitations  Several limitations of our study deserve discussion. First, this umbrella review focused on existing meta-analyses. We found that adverse outcomes were not included in existing meta-analyses, precluding us from making a comprehensive evaluation of both benefits and safety aspects of IF.",a39b9d18-c3ac-4725-b58f-d5a0070be281
28,discussion8," Second, this review did not directly assess the quality of all primary studies included in each meta-analysis. Instead, we relied on the assessment reported by the study authors. Third, our review cannot answer the questions on whether IF has associations with clinical outcomes including cancer, cardiovascular events, and mortality, as these are not included in previously conducted RCTs. Moreover, we did not include meta-analyses of observational studies of IF, which may have a longer duration of follow-up. Most RCTs included in our analysis were limited to short durations of follow-up (ie, a median duration of 3 months) and relatively small number of sample size (ie, median 38 participants). This was partly because weight loss strategies made it relatively difficult for participants to adhere to the assigned treatment for a long period of time, as well as the lack of follow-up to assess the sustaining beneficial effects after cessation of IF.",89e655fd-9236-4678-8a30-a9f59f38e8d4
29,discussion9,"  Conclusions  This umbrella review found beneficial associations of IF with anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes that were supported by moderate to high quality of evidence. Our results support the role of IF, especially modified alternate day fasting (MADF), in adults with overweight or obesity as a weight loss approach with metabolic benefits. More clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to investigate the effects of IF on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality.  Supplement. eAppendix.
