0,abstract0," Previous studies have shown that long‐term light or moderate fasting such as intermittent fasting can improve health and prolong lifespan. However, in humans short‐term intensive fasting, a complete water‐only fasting has little been studied. Here, we used multi‐omics tools to evaluate the impact of short‐term intensive fasting on immune function by comparison of the CD45+ leukocytes from the fasting subjects before and after 72‐h fasting. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of CD45+ leukocytes revealed extensive expression changes, marked by higher gene upregulation than downregulation after fasting. Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes and proteins exposed several pathways critical to metabolic and immune cell functions.",f5e0808d-f0c0-4abd-8e94-95b4b3aea903
1,abstract1," Specifically, short‐term intensive fasting enhanced autophagy levels through upregulation of key members involved in the upstream signals and within the autophagy machinery, whereas apoptosis was reduced by down‐turning of apoptotic gene expression, thereby increasing the leukocyte viability. When focusing on specific leukocyte populations, peripheral neutrophils are noticeably increased by short‐term intensive fasting. Finally, proteomic analysis of leukocytes showed that short‐term intensive fasting not only increased neutrophil degranulation, but also increased cytokine secretion. Our results suggest that short‐term intensive fasting boost immune function, in particular innate immune function, at least in part by remodeling leukocytes expression profile.  Short‐term intensive fasting remodels innate immunity in humans through improving neutrophil function with elevated secretion of cytokines, together with upregulation of autophagy and downregulation of apoptosis.",43256c90-fc85-4190-9837-31334bf039a4

4,abstract4," Light or moderate fasting belongs to incomplete fasting format and mainly consists of intermittent fasting, fasting‐mimicking diets, and calorie restriction. The positive health benefits of incomplete fasting have been well documented (de Cabo & Mattson, 2019). Incomplete fasting was reported to reduce obesity (Bloom, 1959), cardiovascular diseases (Horne et al., 2008, 2013; Most et al., 2018), cancer (Ajona et al., 2020; Di Biase et al., 2016; Nencioni et al., 2018; Pietrocola et al., 2016; Yamaza et al., 2010), rheumatoid arthritis (Kjeldsen‐Kragh et al., 1991), metabolic syndrome , osteoarthritis , fibromyalgia, and improve memory . Through the use of animal fasting models, the mechanism of such health benefits has been becoming clear, such as regulation via ketogenesis (Capozzi et al., 2020; López‐Soldado et al., 2020; Steinhauser et al., 2018), hormone modulation (Fontana et al.",f8dc9963-cd89-49b2-86d1-75e0cdcf8edf
5,abstract5,", 2016; Sutton et al., 2018; Volek et al., 2002), circadian clock , and gut microbiota changes that protect the central nervous system in autoimmunity disorders . Fasting also reduces inflammation , promotes immunological memory , impacts immune cell dynamics and mucosal immune responses , and increases stress resistance (Mladenovic Djordjevic et al., 2021), lipolysis , and autophagy.  In contrast to incomplete fasting, short‐term intensive fasting, such as beego, is complete water‐only fasting without regular food and minimal calories or supplements during the day and at night. Beego is a traditional fasting format for Chinese that lasts days to weeks initially developed for spiritual purpose and later extended to fitness.",a43b64ed-2494-4447-9fae-947a38cfe84f
6,abstract6," It involves psychological assistance such as meditation for Chinese, which is similar to Ramadan for introspection and prayer for Muslims. But beego is different from Ramadan since observers of Ramadan refrain from eating or drinking between sunrise and sunset each day by refeeding every night within an entire holy month (Sheikh & Wallia, 2007). The impact of Ramadan, which includes fasting on the day and refeeding at night during the holly month, on immunity remains controversial, with some reports showing benefits on the immune function, while others show no impact or harmful results (Adawi et al., 2017; Faris et al., 2012; Latifynia et al., 2009). Among other beneficial effects, Ramadan was found to attenuate inflammatory status by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine expression and decreasing circulating levels of leukocytes and body fat .",8c2984ed-2226-4311-ad61-2e24924dbf33
7,abstract7," Despite a decline in the neutrophil phagocytic and serum opsonization indexes, at the end of Ramadan, the percentage of neutrophils participating in phagocytosis increased with fasting. In addition, there was an increase in the percentage of neutrophils demonstrating nitro blue tetrazolium reduction. Therefore, Ramadan might have beneficial effects on neutrophil phagocytic function (Latifynia et al.,2009).  Unlike complete fasting, calorie restriction is one of the light or incomplete fasting formats. Short‐term calorie restriction does not result in beneficial effect on health. Early study shows that dietary restriction impairs neutrophil exudation by reducing CD11b/CD18 expression and chemokine production . In mice, long‐term (4‐months) calorie restriction influences innate and adaptive intestinal immunity.",91081014-a449-4654-8ba8-ba21a41cc1a2
8,abstract8," At the end of 4‐month fasting, lysozyme and phospholipase A2 gene levels were significantly increased, while IgA levels were diminished in the ileum due to reduced transport by its receptor pIgR. Additionally, long‐term calorie restriction differentially modified the expression of innate and adaptive immunity mediators in the intestine with increased gene expression of most cytokines (Suárez‐Souto et al., 2012). A recent study showed that short‐term (2–22 h) incomplete fasting in mice has differential transient effects on multiple organs . There, the authors identified T‐cell regulation as a central and prominent target of systemic modulations during short‐term fasting. Mechanistically, these changes seem to be driven by priming of adaptive immunity and the fine‐tuning of innate immune signaling.",50d73bc0-72de-4676-8a0d-43f04afe08ec
9,abstract9," Similarly, a more recent study on intermittent fasting (overnight or 24‐h fasting followed by 3 h of refeeding) reports reduction in inflammation by blunting human CD4+ T helper cell activation and differentiation .  More ongoing clinical trials are using fasting as a potential therapy, either alone or in combination with current front‐line treatments, for various health conditions . The TrueNorth Health Foundation has been conducting clinical study on water‐only fasting that shows largely positive outcomes with moderate adverse events (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c; Finnell et al., 2018). However, the biological effects of short‐term intensive fasting and the underlying mechanisms of such beneficial impact remain fundamentally unexplored. Our group recently performed a chronological study with beego participants who fasted for 7 or 14 days followed by a 7‐day programmed refeeding phase.",1ccdbf8f-4e78-48c7-8210-c19a31a80a7e
10,abstract10," In there, we observed that beego effectively decreased blood triacylglycerol (TG) selectively in TG‐high subjects, but not in TG‐normal subjects. Despite a transient cholesterol increase in all participants during fasting, these levels were normalized upon completion of the refeeding program. As a result, beego improved cardiovascular physiology and selectively reduced blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. Additionally, beego may coordinate and limit thrombosis risk by reducing platelet formation, activation, aggregation, and degranulation, while retaining normal hemostasis through sustained levels of coagulation factors and other hemostatic proteins . These studies suggest that, under medical supervision, beego can be implemented as a noninvasive intervention to reduce thrombosis risk.",134bcc44-328c-4168-bd72-bcb4b6b1b308

We used breadth first search (BFS) to summarize the key molecular changes after 72 h of intensive fasting.

Starvation is known to trigger autophagy in cell lines and animal models, but in vivo characterization of autophagy activity in human body remains challenging since autophagic flux assays require treatment with pharmacological inhibitors, which is toxic. Thus, high‐throughput sequencing provides a feasible way to address this question. Our proteomic profiling revealed that a group of mammalian autophagy‐related proteins including major autophagy machinery members (Beclin1, Atg3, Atg5, Atg16, etc.), autolysosome members (LAMP, SNAP29, VAMP28, cathepsin D (CTSD), CTSB, etc.",7c0acd59-cba4-4f04-b642-2800193b3e61

21,results9,"4 Intensive fasting reduces apoptosis level of leukocytes and increased neutrophils  Physiological autophagy is a protective mechanism to protect cells during starvation and other stresses, and its activation often inhibits apoptosis. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a majority of down‐regulated genes related to apoptotic activity (69 out of 104 sigDEGs). This suggests that intensive fasting lowers apoptosis activity of leukocytes (Figure 4a). Measurement of apoptotic status by flow cytometry analysis showed a significant increase in the percentage of live cells (Annexin V and PI double negative) in CD45+ leukocyte population from 57 subjects at 72 h after intensive fasting, confirming reduced apoptosis of leukocytes by intensive fasting (Figure 4b).

Significantly more DEGs/DEPs associated with neutrophil degranulation were identified in the enrichment of descendants of leukocyte‐mediated immunity. Neutrophils are largely responsible for pathogen clearance through phagocytosis, degranulation, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, but can also modulate the immune response by interacting with other immune cells such as antigen‐presenting cells or lymphocytes . Both transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed significantly increased enrichment in neutrophil degranulation (Figure 2e, Figure S1), suggesting activation of neutrophils after intensive fasting.",91061237-4e6a-4334-97a2-405875548081

(C, D) gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis of dataset from para‐methoxyamphetamine (PMA)‐ and F.T.‐ stimulated neutrophils  Cytokines released from innate immune cells plays a key role in the regulation of the immune response. These signaling molecules initiate or constrain inflammatory responses to infection and injury (Lacy & Stow, 2011). Notable changes were detected in the expression of cytokines in various leukocytes in response to intensive fasting. Figure 5b illustrates the contribution of neutrophils, NK cells, T cells, and B cells to cytokine secretion. Specifically, NCAM1, HSPB1, F13A1, and PF4 varied significantly in expression level among participants before intensive fasting but stabilized 72 h after the fasting (Figure S2).",ef979ffd-077a-44d6-ab93-541189c4982c
26,results14," Neutrophil and natural killer cells were the main drivers of cytokine responses as manifested by stacked percentages 1163% and 774%, respectively, for neutrophil and natural killer cells (Figure 5b). Next, we used gene set enrichment analysis (gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)) on an immunological signature database  to verify these results. gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis of the transcriptomic profiles showed mainly positive correlation between intensive fasting and stimulated neutrophils. Particularly, one dataset from neutrophils treated with bacterium Francisella tularensis (GSE37416, Schwartz et al., 2013) showed positive correlated expression pattern (Figure 5c).",f6958d36-18b8-496b-9b59-0a6ede1879ef
27,results15," Similarly, another dataset (GSE126757) from a commonly used neutrophil stimuli, para‐methoxyamphetamine (para‐methoxyamphetamine (PMA)), was also considered in verifying the stimulated status of CD45+ population after intensive fasting, and again showed positive correlation (Figure 5d). Given the elevated neutrophil count and frequency 72 h after intensive fasting, we conclude that intensive fasting works as a stimulus in neutrophil activation.  To evaluate a broader impact of intensive fasting on immune response, we performed biochemical analysis on 57 fasting subjects, which showed elevated levels of serum total protein, serum albumin, and serum globulin, but within the normal range. Serum albumin/globulin ratio remained unchanged while serum pre‐albumin decreased (Figure S3), suggesting that intensive fasting strengthen overall immunity by promoting serum protein production.  3 ",02fe3d5c-314f-4001-8889-172694713894
28,discussion0,"  In this clinical study, we applied multi‐omics tools to examine the impact of short‐term intensive fasting on immune function. Our analysis suggests that occasional short‐term intensive fasting enhances immune function, particularly, neutrophil activity. Presumably, this is achieved at least in part by remodeling of the leukocyte's expression profiles (Figure 6).  FIGURE 6 Short‐term intensive fasting remodels innate immune function in humans. 72‐h intensive fasting improves neutrophil function with elevated secretion of cytokines. The fasting‐triggered upregulation of autophagy and downregulation of apoptosis together contribute to the improved innate immunity  Unlike previous work which primarily focuses on circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymphocytes , here we sorted CD45+ leukocytes cells to investigate both the differentials in innate and adaptive immune system.",5af332f2-376a-487f-a806-6d04279dfb55
29,discussion1," CD45+ cells are composed of myeloid, natural killer cells, T cells, B cells, and plasma cells. The ratios of lymphoid and myeloid cells are relatively close in the CD45+ population , enabling us to investigate the biological changes in human immune system. Neutrophils are generally the first responders to bacterial infection and play a pivotal role in initiation and mediation of immune response. Neutrophils exercise their bactericidal ability via a series of biological processes including phagocytosis, secretion of proteases, production of reactive oxygen species, and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (Manfredi et al., 2018; Nathan, 2006). Our transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of CD45+ cells revealed activated neutrophil function and neutrophil degranulation process, accompanied by increased granule contents, which suggests increased granule production.",102553ae-a462-4dc6-8b4c-9ffde8f30fa4
30,discussion2," This degranulation process is a regulated exocytosis of secretory granules containing mediators such as proteases, lipases, and inflammatory mediators. Other functions related to neutrophil activation, such as cell migration and cell adhesion, also displayed positive regulation in response to intensive fasting.  The activation profile of neutrophils 72 h after intensive fasting resembled that of chemical (para‐methoxyamphetamine (PMA)) and biological (F. Tularensis) stimulation. para‐methoxyamphetamine (PMA) has been widely used to induce neutrophil activation in vitro, inducing the release of superoxide anion and neutrophil extracellular traps . Similarly, F. Tularensis, a pathogenic species of Gram‐negative coccobacillus, has been reported to not only activate neutrophil‐mediated immunity, but also to be closely related to longer neutrophil lifespan and subsequently prolonged inflammation.",cdcd6fd5-8f91-4595-ae57-627aa31969f8
31,discussion3," Comparative gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on transcriptomic profiling with para‐methoxyamphetamine (PMA)‐stimulated neutrophils (GSE126757) and F. Tularensis stimulated neutrophils showed molecular variations similar to those observed here at the end of 72‐h intensive fasting. In the process of neutrophil activation, integrin family protein showed variation in both transcripts and protein levels, which have been closely related to leukocyte‐mediated immune activation. Particularly, integrin ITGAL/ITGB2, accompanied with ICAM3, has been reported to contribute to neutrophil efferocytosis of macrophages .  Cathepsin family contains a series of lysosomal proteases that have been implicated in a wide variety of inflammatory activities.",3a7b15e6-beaa-4833-952b-37ccdc33464f
32,discussion4," Cathepsin C (Cathepsin C (CTSC)) is known to function as the key activator of elastase, and cathepsin G (cathepsin G (CTSG)) in neutrophils has been reported as a pathogenesis signature in many auto‐immune and chronic inflammatory diseases , whereas cathepsin D (cathepsin D (CTSD)) has been related not only to immune responses but also regulation of programmed cell death. Considering these factors that weigh greatly in the immune response, these data further suggest that occasional intensive fasting can act as a trigger of the innate immune response. On the contrary, cytokines related to platelet activation are decreased. This is consistent with our recent report on the reduction of blood clots risk by beego .  A previous report showed that overnight or 24‐h fasting can blunt CD4+ Th cells activation and differentiation, which may be exploited as an intervention on auto‐immune diseases .",9a19e162-cc00-432a-a183-077a701b323c
33,discussion5," In this intensive fasting model, we also discovered from transcriptomic profiling on leukocytes that genes involved in lymphocyte differentiation are prone to be negative regulated during intensive fasting. However, peripheral blood count indicates that participants had statistically lower lymphocytes, but within normal range after 72‐h intensive fasting. Thus, our results suggest that intensive fasting favors strengthening of innate immunity.  Autophagy is implicated in multiple functions of various tissues, including but not limited to decelerating of aging and suppression of oncogenesis (Cao et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). In vivo autophagy is effectively activated in response to intensive fasting (Figure 3a,b). This presumably leads to digestion of aged proteins/organelles into amino acids and free fatty acids for recycling and regeneration of new proteins and organelles.",93c9b16e-abb5-48c7-8e0a-3ced74134db6
34,discussion6," Autophagy initiation is highly dependent on Beclin1, a key member in the Beclin1‐PI3K C3 complex . Beclin1 upregulation enhances autophagy . Interestingly, different formats of fasting impacts autophagy in a slightly different way in the regulation of p62, which was reduced in response to intensive fasting in our study (Figure 3a), but was increased in the incomplete fasting regimes . On the contrary, the apoptotic process in leukocytes is prone to suppression after 72‐h intensive fasting, which is proven by flow cytometry and omics signatures (Figure 4). This is in consistence with the role of Beclin1 that activates autophagy but inhibits apoptosis (Wang, 2008). Interestingly, short‐term intensive fasting enhances immune function, but does not aggravate prolonged inflammation which could cause subsequent harm to those with chronic inflammation.",931dd399-a223-4d44-8bed-2f28e265ce2a
35,discussion7," In our recent study, we monitored the hematological profile seven days and in some participants 14 days of intensive fasting after 7‐day refeeding process, and the composition of their leukocyte's populations were more balanced after intensive fasting . Nevertheless, it would be helpful to examine the short‐term and long‐term effects of occasional intensive fasting on other clinical complications such as chronic inflammation or tissue damage.  Many viruses prohibit host autophagy by blocking autophagy‐triggered pathways. A recent study has indicated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) also inhibits host autophagy activity and in vitro administration of spermidine, AKT inhibitor MK‐2206, and the Beclin‐1 stabilizing, anti‐helminthic drug niclosamide effectively inhibits SARS‐CoV‐2 propagation , suggesting a potential application of autophagy against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.",46eeaa66-302b-4c32-b31a-30cef8f3aeca
36,discussion8," Compromised immunity has a high risk of viral disease. Due to quick mutations of fatal viruses such as coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19) that challenge the effectiveness of timely developed drugs and vaccines, strengthening immunity through both medical and non‐medical interventions, including but not limited to fasting, may be helpful for surviving this disease . Intensive fasting causes an extreme starvation stress, which presumably triggers higher activation of autophagy than incomplete fasting does, possibly leading to a better priming of the host immune system to fight against virus diseases.  However, our trial has several limitations. It is difficult to recruit a comparable control group for sampling since the subjects in this fasting study have different subhealthy conditions. It is also not easy to organize large cohort in the same location for several days eating nothing but being requested to donate blood samples.",460e6b7e-754c-4e20-8df4-7f20f86b4b11
37,discussion9," The quantity for each sampling was fully based on the informed consent from the volunteered subjects. The quality of the samples also varied among subjects and even differed in the same subject between two sampling times (0‐ and 72‐h fasting), leading to small size of cohort for multi‐omics analysis and some samples are unpaired. However, the number of subjects used for laboratory biochemical analysis is much bigger since much less quantity for each sample was required.  Psychological induction is known to have an influence on immune function (Black & Slavich, 2016; Davidson et al., 2003). Validation with laboratory animals for psychological influence on intensive fasting is virtually impossible. We noticed that laboratory mice could not survive 4‐day water‐only fasting.",6c6f9eb9-50d9-448d-bae9-113913bf2e4a
38,discussion10," In addition, there was a big variance in the age of the subjects used for our analysis and we were unable to group the data within a similar age although we realized that the immune system undergoes age‐associated changes. Future study with age‐grouped larger cohort is warranted to deepen our understanding of the impact of intensive fasting on immune system and establish direct link between psychological intervene and fasting effect.  Finally, this study focused on leukocytes expression profiling in the context of intensive fasting. Post‐translational modification of proteins and epigenetic modulation of the genome and macromolecules may also be implicated in reshaping immune function in response to intensive fasting. Therefore, we recognize that changes in gene expression patterns at transcriptional and translational levels are only partially responsible for innate immune remodeling by intensive fasting.  4 ",1e4ea707-fa66-4c3a-95f9-02995b47efcc
39,conclusion0," We observed that occasional short‐term intensive fasting has a significant effect on immune function, especially innate immunity. Leukocyte survival can be promoted by enhanced autophagy and decreased apoptosis 72 h after intensive fasting. The degranulation of neutrophils increased significantly, and cytokines that govern immune cells are mostly increased, largely released by neutrophils. This suggests that occasional intensive fasting enhances innate immune function. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of leukocytes after 72‐h intensive fasting and provides new insights into the pathways involved in the systemic immune remodeling after occasional short‐term intensive fasting. Altogether, this suggests that occasional short‐term intensive fasting may be exploited as an immune‐modulatory intervention.  5 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  5.1 Ethics  The study was approved from Institutional Ethics Review Board at Soochow University (Approval No.",8b6f0e3c-8baa-46f8-8c95-81071282471b
