0,methods0," 4.1. Mice and Alternate-Day Fasting Intervention  Female non-obese diabetic (non obese diabetic (NOD)) mice (the non obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ strain) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and maintained under specific pathogen-free condition at the Forsyth Institute. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Forsyth Institute and performed in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.  Mice in the alternate day fasting (ADF) group were fed every other day, and age- and sex-matched mice fed standard chow ad libitum served as controls. All mice had unrestricted access to water throughout the entire experiments. A total of 12 mice per group were used in 4 independent experiments. The number of mice for each specific analysis was indicated in the responding figure legends.  4.2.",c972bb00-fedd-4f64-994d-6595767b4695
1,methods1," Measurement of Stimulated Salivary Flow  Mice were intraperitoneally administered with 100 μL PBS-based secretagogue solution containing isoproterenol (1 mg/mL) and pilocarpine (2 mg/mL). One minute after the injection, saliva was collected continuously for 5 min from the oral cavity of mice with a micropipette. The measurement was consistently performed in the mid-afternoons to exclude the effect of circadian rhythm on the results.  4.3. Histologic Analysis  submandibular gland (SMG) tissues were harvested from euthanized mice and were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Five-micron sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to determine leukocyte infiltration of submandibular gland (SMG)s.",4d23c4bc-7823-41a9-b240-5f3f9adbb8a3
2,methods2," The average numbers of leukocytic foci (comprising at least 50 mononuclear cells per 4 square millimeters) in each of three non-consecutive sections, separated by 100 microns were statistically analyzed, and the infiltration areas were measured with the Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.  4.4. Flow Cytometry  Single cells isolated from submandibular gland (SMG)s or submandibular draining lymph node (smLN) cells were incubated with anti-CD16/32 antibody to block non-specific Fc receptor binding, and stained with a panel of fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against CD4, CD8, CD19, CD44, CD45 and CD62 at 4 °C for 30 min. For intracellular and nuclear staining, cells were then incubated with fluorescence-labeled anti-IFN-γ and anti-IL-17A antibodies following fixation and permeabilization. After being rinsed with cold PBS, the stained cells were analyzed with the FACS Arial II flow cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and FlowJo V10 software.",08bb2b22-cfa8-482b-b94c-e6fe7d6edeb3
3,methods3," All the antibodies utilized for flow cytometric staining were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA).  4.5. Real-Time PCR  Total RNA from submandibular gland (SMG)s and smLNs tissues were exacted using NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Allentown, PA, USA) and then reverse transcribed into complementary DNA with MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The SYBR Green-based real-time PCR amplification was performed for 40 cycles with annealing and extension temperatures at 60 °C on a QuantStudio™ 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA).",f906a384-1253-471d-9322-0d1837a7a575

5,methods5," Detection of Serum Antinuclear Antibodies (antinuclear antibodies (ANA))  Serum samples from mice were diluted 1:40 with cold PBS and subjected to antinuclear antibodies (ANA) measurements using commercially available slides precoated with Hep-2 human epithelial cells (INOVA Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained slides were imaged using an inverted wide-field fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Dublin, CA, USA), and the fluorescence intensity of the staining was quantified with the ImageJ 1.50i software. The concentration of serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA)s was also examined by ELISA with the Mouse antinuclear antibodies (ANA) ELISA Kit (BIOMATIK, Wilmington, DE, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instruction.  4.7. Detection of Anti-M3 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor (M3R)  The M3R peptide (Acetylcholine Receptor (M3R) The M3R peptide (AILFWQYFVGKRTVP)) was synthesized by Biomatic Corporation and kindly provided by Dr.",525d1a23-54d4-44c0-984f-8fcf51b8a9c0
6,methods6," Toshihisa Kawai (Nova Southeastern University). The M3R peptide solution (1 µg/mL) was used to coat Nunc™ MaxiSorp™ flat-bottom 96-well plated (BioLegend) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Non-specific binding sites on the plates were blocked with ELISA Assay Diluent buffer (BioLegend). Sera with serial dilution (1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640, 1:1280, 1:2560, 1:5120) were added to the plate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plates were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA, USA), Avidin-HRP solution and TMB substrate followed by reading as previously reported [28]. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm and 570 nm with a microplate reader (BioTek, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and the absorbance at 450 nm subtracted by that at 570 nm was considered as an indicator for anti-M3R antibody quantity.  4.8. Statistical Analysis  Statistical significance was determined by a two-tailed Student’s t test or ANOVA as appropriate. p values smaller than 0.",dbf0aa43-3765-4442-a8ba-825654d9013e
