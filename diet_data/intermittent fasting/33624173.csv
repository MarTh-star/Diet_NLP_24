0,methods0," Ethical approval  All experiments involving animals were conducted under the authority of a project licence (PPL 40/3646) issued in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Local ethical approval was granted by the University of Manchester Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body. All animal work was conducted at the University of Manchester. Humane endpoints were defined in advance for each procedure and animals were monitored regularly. Care was taken to minimise suffering; no animal reached the defined humane endpoint prior to the scientific endpoint in any of the experiments.  Animals  Virgin female Wistar rats (250–275 g, Charles River UK Ltd, Margate, Kent, UK) were acclimatised to the Biological Services Facility for one week, where they were held under a 12 h light:dark cycle (06:00–18:00) at 21–23°C and 65% humidity. All rats had free access to standard rat chow (BK001 (E) SDS Rodent Breeder and Grower, LBS Biotec, Redhill, UK: gross energy 15.",7f233b27-23d3-446f-b77a-1e7a1b766691

Females were then paired with a Wistar male (275–300 g) until conception was confirmed by the presence of a vaginal plug (dams were checked twice daily at 09:00 and 17:00): this was designated as gestational day 1 (GD1). Females were then randomised to either intermittent fasting (IF, N = 25 rats) or control (C, N = 21 rats) groups and housed singly. Food was removed from the IF dams at 17:00 and returned at 09:00 daily, commencing at GD1 until GD22 (term is at GD23); water was available ad libitum throughout. Body condition scores were monitored to determine the health status of animals; the rat grimace scale and observation of normal behaviours (breathing rate, grooming, nest building, response to environmental stimuli) were used to identify distress or pain. Control animals had access to both food and water ad libitum throughout.",6c6f86ec-3f16-4356-9216-080c0eea0f30
2,methods2," 24 h food and water intake by both groups of dams was calculated by weighing food and water containers daily at the same time; consumption was calculated as the difference in weight. From GD22 onwards, dams were checked regularly throughout the day for delivery of a litter.  The overall study design including the number of dams used to generate the experimental offspring is summarised in S1 Fig.  At term following birth (on postnatal day (PD)1), litter sizes were reduced to 8 animals to minimise the potential impact of variations in litter size on milk availability and pup growth. Pups were sexed by visual estimation of the anogenital distance and randomised to be retained (4 males and 4 females where possible) or culled by stunning followed by decapitation. Organs (brain, liver and kidney) were harvested from the excess PD1 pups and weighed. All dams had free access to both food and water during the suckling period.",7f93e506-c1d4-45c9-b783-72138569c629
3,methods3," Total litter weight was recorded daily from PD1-14 and then every other day to PD28, at which point pups were sexed as above and weaned onto standard chow. The dams were then killed by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anaesthesia (4% isoflurane in oxygen at 2 L /min). Individual offspring were weighed weekly from the age of 5 to 12 weeks, during which time blood pressure was recorded (weeks 5, 7 and 10 as described below) and the rat grimace scale and observation of normal behaviours (breathing rate, grooming, nest building, response to environmental stimuli) were used to identify distress or pain; animals were then used in one of the experimental procedures described below (S1 Fig).",ac93f9a6-2fd0-4f07-b392-cf7b3f04aaf1
4,methods4,"  Blood pressure  Systolic blood pressure (Systolic blood pressure (SBP)) was measured by tail cuff plethysmography (Model LE5001, PanLab, Spain) without the use of restraint, in order to minimise distress, in conscious male and female rats at 5, 7 and 10 weeks of age (control n = 80 pups from N = 11 litters; IF n = 104 pups from N = 13 litters). These rats went forward for use in one of the experiments described below, after which they were killed by cervical dislocation under anaesthesia.  Glucose and insulin tolerance tests  Glucose (Glucose (GTT)) and insulin (insulin (ITT)) tolerance tests were conducted in separate groups of 12 week old rats (control n = 5–6 pups per sex from N = 5–6 litters; IF n = 6–7 pups per sex from N = 6–7 litters).",a3f37e45-c3e2-4686-a9ff-421e01c799ba
5,methods5," Rats were fasted overnight for 16 h prior to the collection of a pin-prick blood sample from the tail for the measurement of baseline glucose concentration using an Accu-Chek Mobile blood glucose monitoring system (Roche Diagnostics, West Sussex, UK). Animals then received either an i.p. injection of sterile glucose solution (10% glucose in 0.9% saline at 1 g/kg body weight for the Glucose (GTT)) or human insulin (0.75 unit/kg body weight, I9278, Sigma Aldrich for the insulin (ITT)), following which pin-prick blood samples were collected up to 120 min post-injection. Animals experienced no more than transient discomfort as a result of blood sampling; less than 10% of total blood volume was collected. At the end of the experiment animals were killed by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anaesthesia (4% isoflurane in oxygen at 2 L /min).",1b3874fc-2dbf-491a-91f9-75fc28746d6b
6,methods6,"  Nephron number  Nephron number was determined at PD1 (control n = 4 pups per sex from N = 4 litters; IF n = 3–5 pups from N = 5 litters) and PD12 (control n = 6 pups per sex from N = 6 litters; IF n = 5–6 pups from N = 6 litters), as described previously [17]. Pups were killed by decapitation using a method appropriate to their age (following stunning at PD1 or under isoflurane anaesthesia at PD12). Kidneys were decapsulated, minced and digested in 10 mL 1 M HCl at 37°C for 3 (PD1) or 15 min (PD12), after which 50 mL deionised water was added and homogenates were stirred gently at 4°C for 8 h. Mature glomeruli were counted in 20 x 40 μL aliquots per kidney; comma and S shaped bodies were not included.  Renal function  Renal function was measured in 14 week old offspring (control n = 5 pups per sex from N = 5 litters; IF n = 7 pups per sex from N = 7 litters) under Inactin anaesthesia (sodium thiobutabarbital 100 mg/kg body weight i.p.",c122f3f8-329f-4735-863e-d22818e1869b

A surgical plane of anaesthesia was confirmed through the absence of a pedal reflex; this was checked at regular intervals throughout the experiment. A priming dose of clearance markers (0.148 MBq 3H inulin, PerkinElmer, Monza, Italy and 12 mg para-aminohippuric acid (para aminohippuric acid (PAH)), A3759, Sigma Aldrich in 0.2 mL 0.9% saline) was administered intravenously following which animals were infused continuously with 0.9% saline containing 3H inulin (0.0333 MBq/mL) and para aminohippuric acid (PAH) (1 mg/mL) at 50 μL/min for a 3 h equilibration period. Thereafter urine samples were collected via a bladder catheter at 15 min intervals over 3 h; arterial blood samples (400 μL) were collected once every hour over 3 h. Blood pressure was recorded continuously via a carotid artery catheter (Powerlab 800/s, ADInstruments, Hastings, East Sussex, UK).",ae219a7f-9445-4fb0-b86f-d0193b8ad4c9
8,methods8," Haematocrit was measured at the end of the experiment for the subsequent calculation of effective renal blood flow. Urine and plasma samples were analysed for 3H inulin activity (2000CA Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Analyser, Canberra Industries, Meriden, CT, USA), para aminohippuric acid (PAH) (standard colorimetric assay), Na+ and K+ concentrations (flame photometer model 420, Sherwood Scientific Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and osmolality (Vapour pressure osmometer model 5500, Wescor, Inc, Logan, UT, USA); plasma was also analysed for protein concentration (absorbance at 280 nm, Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Animals were killed by cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment.  Salt preference and aversion threshold  A two-bottle choice protocol was used to determine salt preference and total fluid intake, as described previously [18].",df19ee9e-6e7c-4677-889e-cb9553d45727
9,methods9," At 7 weeks of age rats (control n = 5 pups per sex from N = 5 litters; IF n = 6 pups per sex from N = 6 litters) were housed individually and offered bottles containing sterile water or 0.9% saline. Following 2 days acclimatisation, daily fluid intake was recorded over 5 consecutive days. The concentration threshold for salt aversion was subsequently determined by offering the rats a choice between sterile water and increasing concentrations of saline (from 0.9% to 2.1% in 0.3% increments every 3 days over 12 days) to determine the concentration at which they switched their preference from saline to water. Body condition scores and skin turgor were monitored to determine the hydration status of animals; the rat grimace scale and observation of normal behaviours (breathing rate, grooming, nest building, response to environmental stimuli) were used to identify distress or pain.",630336cc-e42b-4c9b-8a3e-ad827568f7a0
10,methods10," At the end of the experiment animals were killed by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anaesthesia (4% isoflurane in oxygen at 2 L /min).  Extracellular fluid volume  Extracellular fluid volume was determined in 12 week old offspring (control n = 5 pups per sex from N = 5 litters; IF n = 6 pups per sex from N = 6 litters) under Inactin anaesthesia (100 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) as described previously [18]. Following a laparotomy, both sets of renal vessels were occluded using 3–0 mersilk and the abdomen was closed. 0.222 MBq 3H inulin in 350 μL 0.9% saline was injected intravenously, followed by a saline flush (total volume of injectate was 500 μL). Following a 90 min equilibration period, blood samples (50 μL) were collected every 10 min over 60 min to measure plasma 3H inulin activity and to calculate the dilution of the injected 3H inulin.",9b02190f-8a55-4bc4-b8aa-8588618acdcc
11,methods11," Animals were killed by cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment and a sample of urine was taken from the bladder to confirm occlusion of the renal vessels.  High salt diet  The impact of dietary salt loading on Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and renal function was determined in a separate group of rats. These animals were either exposed to maternal IF in utero or a control ad libitum diet as described above. Following weaning at 4 weeks, rats were randomised to receive either a high salt (4% NaCl) diet (BK001 (E) 4% NaCl SDS Rodent Breeder and Grower, LBS Biotec, Redhill, UK) or a standard (1% NaCl) rat chow diet (BK001 (E) SDS Rodent Breeder and Grower, LBS Biotec, Redhill, UK) until 14 weeks of age (control n = 5 pups per sex per diet from N = 5 litters; IF n = 6 pups per sex per diet from N = 6 litters).",ab04cfec-065b-4edd-889b-7c55702affee
12,methods12," Body condition scores and skin turgor were monitored to determine the hydration status of animals; the rat grimace scale and observation of normal behaviours (breathing rate, grooming, nest building, response to environmental stimuli) were used to identify distress or pain. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured as described above at 5, 7 and 10 weeks of age. At 12 weeks of age the rats were housed individually in metabolism cages until they had voided sufficient urine for analysis (3 mL typically collected over 3 h in order to minimise distress; no animal was held in a metabolism cage for more than 4 h). Renal function was then determined in anaesthetised rats at 14 weeks of age, as described above. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment.  Urine analysis  Urinary creatinine concentration was determined using a colorimetric assay, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (DetectX urinary creatinine kit, Arbor Assays, MI, USA).",dbd63bd7-2a94-49a9-a5b3-7fe747a05c9e

16,results0," Maternal intermittent fasting impairs maternal weight gain and slows growth of male offspring  Pregnant rats subjected to IF ate 25 ± 1% less food over the course of gestation than controls with ad libitum access to food (P < 0.001, S2A Fig). Their ad libitum water intake tended to be lower too, reaching statistical significance (P < 0.05) over several days in the second half of gestation (S2B Fig). As a result, IF dams gained significantly less weight than controls from GD18 onwards (P < 0.001, S2C Fig). Despite this reduction in weight gain by IF dams, their litter sizes and the body weight of newborn pups did not differ significantly from that of control dams (Table 1), even though all IF dams delivered ~0.5 day earlier than controls. Although body weight did not differ between IF and control pups at PD1, organ growth, particularly that of the brain, was impaired.

17,results1,05) IF rats were significantly lower than that of the controls (Table 2). This reflected a significant reduction in brain weight (P < 0.05) rather than liver weight in females (P > 0.05). Males exhibited a similar pattern; however the reduction in brain weight did not reach statistical significance. Kidney weight was also reduced significantly in both male (P < 0.01) and female (P < 0.001) IF rats compared with controls (Table 2).  10.1371/journal.pone.0258372.t001 Table 1 Litter size and pup birth weight at PD1 in control and IF offspring.

35,discussion0," Having shown previously that exposure to IF during pregnancy resulted in a number of changes in maternal, fetal and placental function [13], the primary aim of the current study was to establish whether the intrauterine challenge posed by IF leads to altered cardiovascular, metabolic or renal function in the offspring. The picture that has emerged is that, in contrast to other models of dietary manipulation during pregnancy in the rat such as the maternal low protein (LP) model [14, 17, 21], IF appeared to have minimal impact on the offspring under basal conditions. It was not until IF offspring were subject to a second, postnatal dietary challenge in the form of salt loading that a susceptibility to renal injury was revealed in males.  We have reported previously that the ~30% reduction in food intake by pregnant rats subjected to the IF regimen was associated with a significant reduction in fetal weight at GD21 [13].",877c4f8e-2e20-4a30-b7e5-c65872b67e64
36,discussion1," In the current study we allowed rats to deliver at term (23 days) and observed that the birth weight of IF pups was not different from that of controls, even though we consistently found that IF dams delivered ~0.5 day early. The rat fetus normally undergoes rapid growth over the final 2 days of gestation [22, 23]; nonetheless the magnitude of the increase in body weight by IF fetuses is striking, bearing in mind that both fetal sexes exhibit FGR at GD21 [13]. While control fetuses increased their body weight by 79 ± 6% between GD21 and term at 23 days, IF fetuses gained 97 ± 5% in order to catch up and achieve a comparable weight to control pups at birth. This pattern of growth restriction followed by rapid catch up growth contrasts with other models of developmental programming, such as the maternal LP model in which fetal weight was greater at GD21 yet birth weight was reduced compared with controls [24].",979c0e26-caea-4c06-9285-0f8b77975c62
37,discussion2," In humans, we reported recently in a meta-analysis of the impact of Ramadan fasting during pregnancy that birth weight was unaffected by maternal fasting [2]. Therefore, while the pattern of fetal growth in our IF rat model differs from other developmental programming models, it appears to reflect that seen in human Ramadan fasting as evidenced by the lack of impact on birth weight.  In early postnatal life, growth of IF pups matched that of controls; however from PD18 until weaning at 4 weeks IF pups grew more slowly. Interestingly, rat pups begin to move away from a diet comprising milk alone to one which includes solid food from around PD16-18 [25], implying that the retarded growth of IF pups prior to weaning was not due to a reduction in the quality or quantity of milk provided by the dam. Indeed, the growth retardation continued beyond weaning until week 12.",b4a50f62-3a4b-4fe1-8e88-e54197a8aefa
38,discussion3," However, this was only apparent in male offspring; IF females grew at the same rate as their control counterparts, indicating that there may be sex-dependent differences in nutrient and energy utilisation which are affected by the in utero nutrient environment. In male offspring the mechanism may involve changes in mitochondrial function: a reduction in muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been observed in male rats exposed to a LP diet in utero [26]. In contrast mitochondrial function was increased male protein-restricted mice, leading to greater oxidative capacity of muscle, increased energy expenditure and diminished weight gain [27]. A different picture has been reported in female offspring exposed to maternal undernutrition, where postnatal weight gain was associated with leptin resistance [28]. Hence maternal dietary stress appears to affect different parts of the energy regulation pathway in males and females.",9a3fbaa8-66d4-4777-a428-520d39b4db72
39,discussion4,"  Despite the pups having comparable body weights to controls at birth, the growth of key organs was not proportionate in new-born IF pups. The brain:liver weight ratio was reduced in IF pups, suggesting that brain growth had not been spared relative to visceral organ growth. This contrasts with other models of food restriction during pregnancy in which growth of the brain is spared at the expense of visceral organs such as the liver [29]. There are no published data on the impact of maternal fasting during pregnancy on brain growth in humans. However, neonatal head circumference as a proxy of brain growth did not show any difference between infants of fasted and non-fasted mothers [30, 31].",fc9bfe65-ed02-4f59-aa0b-931abf6e2fd7
40,discussion5," Yet, it is interesting to note that a large census-based study of Muslim populations in Uganda (n = 80,000) and Iraq (n = 250,000) has shown that exposure to Ramadan fasting during the first month of pregnancy increased the offspring’s risk of ‘mental or learning disability’ by 50% and of ‘psychological disability’ by 63% [7]. These surveys were not designed to identify the nature of any cognitive deficit associated with maternal IF. However, nutritional challenges during pregnancy leading to low birth weight [32] and slow postnatal growth [33] have been linked to impaired cognitive function in humans in later life.",0234d90d-30cc-4856-89fa-30b2797db1e4
41,discussion6," It is interesting to note, therefore, that Muslim children living in England who were exposed to Ramadan fasting in utero during the first trimester in particular achieved significantly lower scores in the Key Stage 1 maths, reading and writing tests (taken in primary schools at the age of 7 years) than either Muslim children who were not exposed to Ramadan fasting in utero or to Caribbean children matched for socioeconomic status [34].  Kidney weight was also reduced in IF pups at birth, suggesting that renal development was compromised. Despite this, nephron number was not different from that in controls either at birth or later at PD12. The kidney is particularly vulnerable to nutritional insults during pregnancy. Renal mass and nephron number have been reported to be lower in rat offspring exposed to calorific restriction [35] and LP diets [17] during pregnancy.",b24a3828-d8ac-480c-b3a8-032d154d5036
42,discussion7," Nephron deficit in particular has been linked to the development of high blood pressure [36], although there is evidence to suggest that low nephron number and hypertension may be independent features of the LP rat model [37]. We acknowledge that we did not use the gold standard method to determine nephron number in the form of non-biased stereology; nonetheless we did not see a difference between control and IF offspring either at birth when nephrogenesis is still underway or at PD12 when nephrogenesis is complete in the rat [19]. The reason for the apparent mismatch between reduced kidney weight at birth and unaltered nephron number in IF offspring is unclear. Li et al. [38] have reported that pre-term babies exhibit disproportionate growth of the renal compartments: the cortex had undergone hypertrophy whereas the medulla was under developed compared with term babies at 6 months of age.",1d1ed69c-35b3-49d7-aaf6-621342c0fe3c
43,discussion8," This raises the possibility that despite the apparent lack of a nephron deficit in IF offspring, growth rates across the renal compartments may have differed between IF and control kidneys. Further studies are necessary to confirm this notion. It is also of interest to note that, in contrast to the food-only model of IF described in the current study, a 30% reduction in nephron number has observed in rat offspring when pregnant dams were subjected to intermittent restriction of both food and water for the whole of pregnancy [39]; however shorter periods of food and water restriction (3 days which is equivalent to 1 month of human pregnancy) had no effect on nephron count [40].  Blood pressure, first measured at 5 weeks and finally at 14 weeks at the end of the study, did not differ between IF and control offspring of either sex.",03dbc8d4-dec4-4af8-bd20-c578e964d12e
44,discussion9," This is in marked contrast to other models of developmental programming, including calorific restriction [41], high fat [42] and LP diets [14] as well as fetal exposure to glucocorticoids [43], in which hypertension is a common feature. It is possible that IF rats may go on to develop high blood pressure later in life: Kahn et al. [42] reported that the female offspring of dams fed a high fat diet were not hypertensive until 180 days old, and that males still had not developed high blood pressure at 360 days of age. Conversely, we have reported previously that offspring exposed to a LP diet have elevated blood pressure from as early as 4 weeks of age [17]. As there is variability in the timescales over which hypertension can develop in rat models of developmental programming, we would need to assess blood pressure in IF rat offspring over a longer period before we could confirm that the offspring do not develop hypertension later in life.",0b26211d-b354-4eb3-842b-25e3cbd2b5db
45,discussion10,"  Renal function did not differ between adult (14 week old) IF and control offspring under basal conditions, which is in accord with the absence of any change in either blood pressure or extracellular fluid volume. We have reported previously that renal haemodynamics, assessed in the same manner as the current study, are unaltered in 4 week old LP rats [17], while others have recorded a reduction in creatinine clearance (a marker of glomerular filtration rate) at this age [16]. Glomerular filtration rate did not differ in older LP rats (20 weeks); however albuminuria was present [16] indicating that the glomerular filtration barrier was damaged. Renal tubular function in the LP rat does, however, appear to be impaired from an early age. We observed a natriuresis and diuresis in LP rats aged 4 weeks, which appeared to be driven by a reduction in Na+K+ATPase activity in the renal medulla [44].",69783e20-8014-49f4-a550-7ccf52d78d65
46,discussion11," Despite the loss of sodium, LP rats had increased extracellular fluid volume [18] and raised blood pressure [44]. Hence it appears that renal function and extracellular fluid volume regulation in the LP rat differs from that in the IF model.  In an attempt to uncover any underlying deficit in kidney function, we challenged a separate group of IF rats by weaning them onto a high (4%) salt diet prior to assessing their renal function at 14 weeks of age. Salt loading revealed subtle, but important, differences between IF and control animals. For example, the high salt diet resulted in comparable increases in blood pressure in both IF and control animals. However, blood pressure in the IF rats began to increase at an earlier age than their control counterparts. This was particularly apparent in the IF males which became hypertensive at 7 weeks whereas blood pressure did not begin to increase in control males until 10 weeks of age.",ccd4488a-c47f-4d32-abde-9a52e6705f79
47,discussion12," Renal haemodynamics did not differ between IF and control rats maintained on a high salt diet and although the urinary sodium excretion rate was higher than that in animals maintained on a standard (1%) salt diet, it did not differ between IF and control animals fed a high salt diet. Yet there were indications that the high salt diet had affected the kidneys of male IF rats. The urinary albumin:creatinine concentration ratio, a marker of glomerular damage [45], and urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) concentration, an early marker of renal injury [20], were both elevated in IF males. neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) is produced by injured renal tubules and as a result of macrophage infiltration following inflammation [46], which is commonly associated with dietary salt loading [47].",5235bc29-41fd-4fbd-bcb4-e74ad71f1b63
48,discussion13," The marked increase in urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) concentration in IF males therefore suggests that they are more susceptible to renal inflammation following salt loading compared with their control counterparts. This in turn raises the possibility that IF males, in particular, may be more prone to a deterioration in renal function later in life.  The only other differences in renal function that we observed in rats fed either a 1% or 4% salt diet was between the sexes. This reflects, in part, the experimental design as infusion rates were not adjusted for body weight. Rather, in common with many other studies of renal function [48, 49] as well as previous reports from our laboratory [17, 44], urinary outputs were adjusted for body weight instead.",4ec657e2-96b4-4e55-bb27-07e60e26616d
49,discussion14," We acknowledge that this is a limitation of our study; nonetheless if there had been sex-related differences in the IF animals the sex * diet interaction term in the ANOVA would have been able to highlight such effects. Therefore, it is unlikely that the approach taken obscured any sex-related effect of exposure to IF.  In addition to assessing the impact of salt loading on blood pressure and renal function, we also determined the salt preference and aversion threshold of IF rats. When given a choice between water and low concentration solutions of saline to drink, rats express a preference for saline [50]. This salt preference is increased in several models of developmental programming, including the LP rat [18], Dahl salt-sensitive rats exposed to a low sodium diet in utero [51] and rats whose mothers underwent a partial aortic ligation [52].",3ef5b95e-e218-40e5-8659-f8e52da2ac4e
50,discussion15," Similarly maternal dehydration, which can be induced in the rat by subcutaneous injection of polyethylene glycol in order to mimic human vomiting during pregnancy, also increased salt preference in the offspring [53]. It is interesting to note in this context that the risk of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG—morning sickness) is increased among pregnant women fasting during Ramadan, particularly in the first trimester [54], suggesting perhaps that their offspring may have a greater preference for salt. HG itself is associated with higher blood pressure in children age 5–6 years [55] which is coupled with lower insulin sensitivity and elevated cortisol concentrations [56] and greater risk of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety [57]. Therefore HG must be considered as a potential confounder when interpreting the outcomes of Ramadan fasting studies in humans.",e7ad21aa-21db-4bba-81e4-c3c6ef75e315
51,discussion16,"  In contrast to other developmental programming models, no such enhanced preference for salt was observed in the IF rat model. Both male and female IF rats drank similar quantities of saline, as a proportion of their total fluid intake, compared with their control counterparts. There was, however, a strong sex difference. Both IF and control females drank more fluid relative to their body weight compared with males, and of that fluid, the females drank significantly more saline (72–79% of total fluid intake) compared with their male counterparts (51–54%). Similar sex-dependent differences in salt preference have been noted before and have been attributed to oestrogen-mediated blunting of salt-sensitivity in female rats [58].  Although there was no within-sex difference in the salt preference of IF and control rats, there was a difference in the salt aversion threshold of IF females compared with control females.",230260ec-0867-4c50-86b2-74dc08a3da7d
52,discussion17," Control females began to show an aversion to saline when the concentration reached 1.5% whereas the IF females tolerated concentrations up to 1.8%. The literature in this area is unclear: in males the point of indifference (the concentration of saline at which rats express equal preference for water and saline) is reported to be at 1.5% in both neonatal and adult rats; saline solutions of 3% or higher are rejected completely [59]. Female rats are able to detect lower concentrations of saline than males, while also being more tolerant of higher concentrations [58]. However, the aversion threshold for saline does not appear to have been reported in female rats. Oestrogen has been shown to regulate salt-sensitivity in female rats [58]; however we have no data on sex steroids or their receptors in IF rats upon which to base a hypothesis to explain the observed difference in the salt aversion threshold.",ffd1df8d-1e93-4077-9289-fa7255ef0635
53,discussion18,"  Both male and female IF offspring responded to glucose and insulin challenges in the same manner as control rats, indicating that they were not insulin-resistant at 12 weeks of age. Impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance have been reported in other models of developmental programming, including calorific restriction [60] and LP diets [15], but again age seems to be critical. Hales et al. [61] reported that LP offspring were actually more glucose tolerant than controls at 3 months of age; it was not until they were 15 months old that they became glucose intolerant and exhibited frank diabetes [15]. MicroRNA (miRNA) may act as an early marker of the risk of developing diabetes in later life. Ferland-McCollough et al. [62] reported that expression of miRNA-483-3p, which regulates growth/differentiation factor 3 (GDF3), is upregulated as early as 22 days of age in LP rats and remained increased at 3 months of age.",992cf99d-bf22-474a-abe1-de427202ba91
54,discussion19," These authors proposed that, as a result of increased expression of miRNA-483-3p, GDF3 is downregulated which in turn affects the ability of adipose cells to store lipids and ultimately leads to insulin resistance. It would therefore be of interest to assess miRNA-483-3p expression in IF rats, as a potential early marker of insulin resistance and diabetes in later life.  A limitation of this study is that the pregnant dams were fasted for the whole of pregnancy. Ramadan takes place over a lunar month, which is approximately equivalent to 3 days of a rat pregnancy. Ramadan could fall at any stage of a woman’s pregnancy, so in order to assess the effects of exposure to IF at all stages of fetal development and to maximise the potential impact upon the offspring we elected to fast animals for the whole of pregnancy.",c36ffa75-10bb-4112-aea8-37abbd36a292
55,discussion20," This approach has the advantage that it captures the potential impact of IF on the development of multiple organ systems in the same animal, thereby reducing the overall number of animals necessary in accordance with the 3Rs. However, we acknowledge that it does not fully replicate the pattern of fasting as practiced by Muslims; therefore in future studies a more targeted approach will be taken, focussing on critical periods of development e.g. early pregnancy for development of the brain or GD13-15 for development of the metanephros.  In conclusion, this study has shown that exposure to IF in utero appears to have minimal impact on the cardiovascular, metabolic and renal health of adult offspring, contrasting with offspring outcomes from other developmental programming models in which maternal dietary intake is altered during pregnancy. Despite experiencing FGR as a result of altered placental nutrient transport function [13], IF pups have comparable birth weights with controls.",d70a95b9-f453-43a8-b5af-feda6cee35ef
56,discussion21," As they grow, blood pressure remains normal, glucose and insulin tolerance are unaltered and basal renal function is unaffected up to the age of 14 weeks. When challenged by a dietary salt load, blood pressure begins to increase sooner in IF rats compared with controls; however the magnitude of the overall hypertensive response is no different. The kidneys of IF rats appear to be able to accommodate the increase in sodium intake; however there are indications that they have undergone injury as male IF rats in particular exhibited albuminuria and had raised urinary concentrations of the kidney injury marker, neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL). Therefore, IF rats may be more susceptible to renal injury.  Supporting information  S1 Fig Study design (A) normal 1% salt diet and (B) high 4% salt diet.

Male (circles) and female (squares) control (N = 5 per diet A, C) and IF (N = 5 per diet B, D) rats were weaned at 4 weeks of age onto a diet containing either 1% NaCl (NS–normal salt, closed symbols) or 4% NaCl (HS–high salt, open symbols). Data are presented as mean ± SEM, except when SEM falls within the size of the symbol. Statistical comparisons were by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Tukey’s test. * P < 0.05, *** P < 0.001 HS diet vs NS diet.

61,discussion26,"  S6 Fig Potassium excretion rate (A), fractional excretion of potassium (B), osmolar excretion rate (C) and free water clearance (D) in anaesthetised control and IF offspring fed a 4% salt diet from weaning until 14 weeks of age. Urinary excretion was measured over 3 h during continuous infusion of 0.9% saline at 50 μL/min in male and female control (N = 5 open boxes) and IF (N = 6 shaded boxes) offspring. Data are presented as box (with median) and whisker plots (5th and 95th centiles). Statistical comparisons were by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test. * P < 0.05 IF vs control; ## P < 0.01, ### P < 0.001 male vs female.
