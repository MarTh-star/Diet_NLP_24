0,methods0,"Design and study sample An appropriate method for assessing longer-term, habitual dietary intake is the food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), as it is rather inexpensive, can be implemented on a large scale, and implies a modest burden on study participants (32). In the current study, data are derived from the project Healthy and Sustainable Lifestyle (Healthy and Sustainable Lifestyle (HSL)), which in 2014 collected data in collaboration with the Child Food Courage project (33). As part of these projects, an electronic questionnaire was developed for assessing lifestyle behaviors, self-perceived health and life quality among parents of toddlers, and food and eating behaviors among their children. A convenience sample, consisting of parents with children born between 2008 and 2011, was recruited through kindergartens. Parents were informed about the purpose and implications of the study by email and through a web page.",1c4c9c3e-fe5d-42b6-a6a5-31a6d4e0cdf2
1,methods1," For each child, either the mother or the father could participate. In total 1,191 parents from 19 kindergartens in the county of Vest-Agder, Southern Norway, were invited to participate, and 86 parents signed up. Parents provided consent electronically, followed by distribution of the questionnaire survey by email. The time period between the test and the retest distribution was approximately 14 days. In total 75 parents completed the first survey and 67 parents completed the questionnaire at both occasions.  The New Nordic Diet (NND) score The electronic questionnaire incorporated a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) assessing participants’ habitual intake of selected foods, among them typical Nordic foods. Only frequency of consumption was assessed, the items did not specify portion sizes or amount.",c6a0978f-c601-4277-b01d-06f55bff89c1
2,methods2," The New Nordic Diet (NND) score was previously constructed in order to capture adherence to the concept of the New Nordic Diet (NND) (17), where health, sustainability, gastronomic potential, and Nordic identity are fundamental principles (34); and it comprises 10 subscales summarizing meal pattern and intake of typical Nordic foods. Table 1 describes the components underlying the construction of the 10 subscales, including related questionnaire items and response options. Meal pattern was included in the score due to the potentially favorable impact of routine consumption of meals on dietary quality (35, 36). Furthermore, meat from game (moose, reindeer, deer), wild fish, other seafood, and berries were collapsed into one subscale (‘Foods from the wild countryside’), as these foods are characterized by a common reliance on soil and local vegetation (17).",446eb1a1-84c5-47aa-9caa-5e38c2245f68
3,methods3," Also, such a combination of foods is in line with one of the specific guidelines of the concept New Nordic Diet (NND): ‘More foods from the wild countryside’ (34). In the present study, the number of indicator questions for the subscales ranged from 1 to 5, in total 24 questions. Question formulation was as follows: ‘How often do you eat…’, or ‘How often do you drink…’, with 10 response options ranging from ‘Never’ (coded 0), up to ‘Several times a day’ (coded 10). Each subscale was dichotomized by the median and assigned values of ‘0’ or ‘1’, with ‘1’ indicating a more frequent consumption of main meals (subscale 1), or a more favorable intake of the relevant foods (subscale 2–10). Adding the subscales yielded a score ranging from 0 to 10, implying that each subscale was given equal weighting. Increasing score expressed higher compliance with the New Nordic Diet (NND).",3b556344-2675-4c20-aac4-c02f12c92d15
4,methods4," This procedure is in line with methods applied in previous studies exploring relations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (24) and selected healthy aspects of the Nordic diet (12) with health parameters. The score was further trichotomized, grouping participants into ‘low’ (0–3 points), ‘medium’ (4–5 points), and ‘high’ (6–10 points) adherence to the New Nordic Diet (NND). The cut-offs were determined to obtain the most equally sized groups.

8,analysis0,"Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software package IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Somers, NY, USA). Test–retest reliability of the subscales and the final New Nordic Diet (NND) score was investigated through bivariate correlations. As the distributions of the subscales were skewed, correlations were computed with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, whereas the final New Nordic Diet (NND) score was presented with Pearson's correlation coefficient, due to a normal distribution of scores. Furthermore, cross tabulation and kappa measure of agreement (k) were applied for assessing the test–retest agreement of classification into the trichotomized New Nordic Diet (NND) score, as well as into the dichotomized subscales. A two-sided p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. ",97ade1a4-91f0-43d3-b7f7-8e379f4c84e3

Table 2 presents details for the results from the test–retest analyses. The correlation coefficients between test and retest were r=0.80 (Pearson) for the New Nordic Diet (NND) score, and  r=0.54–0.84 (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient) for the different subscale scores, all p<0.001.

11,discussion0,"In the present study, we found acceptable test–retest reliability of the previously developed New Nordic Diet (NND) score (17). The test–retest correlation coefficients for the subscales ranged from 0.54 to 0.84, while the test–retest correlation for the total New Nordic Diet (NND) score was 0.80, all highly significant. This result can be considered acceptable, as correlation coefficients in the order of 0.50 to 0.70 appear typical for reproducibility of nutrient intakes, and is comparable with that of several biological measurements in subjects under real-life conditions (32). In the context of previous studies, Hu et al. (26) assessed the test–retest reliability of two dietary patterns (the ‘prudent’ and ‘western’) defined by factor analysis, based on dietary data from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered twice 1 year apart, in a subsample of 127 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.",27aef97f-11e7-4b69-a2aa-06d18cdbf853
12,discussion1," This latter mentioned study, reported correlation coefficients from test to retest ranging from 0.36 to 0.92 for the individual foods, 0.70 for the ‘prudent’ pattern, and 0.67 for the ‘western’ pattern. Using the same dietary data as the study by Hu et al. (26), Newby et al. (27) computed two Dietary Quality Index Revised (DQI-R) scores, and reported the reliability correlation (Pearson) for the two food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) scores to be 0.72. Furthermore, Khani et al. (28) defined three dietary patterns using factor analysis on data derived from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), also completed twice 1 year apart, in a subsample of 212 women participating in the Swedish Mammography Cohort. In this study, Spearman correlation coefficients for the patterns ‘healthy’, ‘western’, and ‘drinker’ were reported to be 0.63, 0.68, and 0.73, respectively. In a sample of Japanese men (n=244) and women (n=254), Nanri et al.",75478b20-ee22-4e95-835c-885cb0e7ba7f
13,discussion2," (29) explored test–retest reliability of three Japanese dietary patterns (the ‘prudent’, ‘westernized’, and ‘traditional’, identified by principal component analysis) and found that Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from 0.55 to 0.77. Although not entirely comparable due to methodological differences (such as a posteriori defined patterns, 1 year instead of approximately 2 weeks between questionnaire administrations, and larger samples), these correlation coefficients are somewhat lower than the ones presented in our study. One possible explanation could be the time interval between administrations. A time period of 1 year may reduce the reproducibility as a result of true changes in dietary intake, as well as variation in response, and not necessarily express poor questionnaire performance (32).",f5abfa93-bfa1-4e40-8478-dfd6ccfae0d5
14,discussion3,"  In addition to performing bivariate correlation analyses for exploring test–retest reliability, we applied kappa measure of agreement, combined with observed percentage agreement, as a measure of chance-corrected proportional agreement. According to Altman (37), values of kappa above 0.80 express very good agreement, 0.61–0.80 good agreement, 0.41–0.60 moderate agreement, 0.21–0.40 fair agreement, and <0.20 poor agreement. Thus, 67–88% correct classification of the subscales from test to retest, and kappa measures of agreement of k=0.32–0.76, suggests acceptable test–retest reliability. Regarding the total New Nordic Diet (NND) score, 69% correct classification, a kappa value of 0.52, and less than 2% grossly misclassified, supports the indication of an acceptable test–retest reliability (38). For comparison, Beck et al.",0214f347-8471-4c54-81e2-e74f5d0b9f60

16,discussion5,"88 from test to retest; 62% of the subjects were correctly classified from test to retest, and 3% were classified in extreme categories (31). These two latter studies present results much in line with our findings, yet direct comparisons should be made with caution because of different methodological approaches. However, considering the time period between questionnaire administrations, the study of Beck et al. (30), as well as the study of Huybrechts et al. (31), were relatively comparable to our study. Although a definite answer to an ideal time interval may not exist, a time period as long as 1 year could disrupt evaluation of true questionnaire performance (32).  Regarding the subscales in the present study, 4 out of 10 were based on one questionnaire item only, providing few response alternatives and hence a skewed distribution. Consequently, the dichotomization by the median resulted in slightly different sized groups for some subscales.",186c182d-8d23-407a-a462-7c9ac61a45a4
17,discussion6," Still, considering previous study results (17, 18), we feel confident that the method is sufficient for ranking and segregating participants according to adherence to the New Nordic Diet (NND). Besides, the total New Nordic Diet (NND) score, which was the main outcome in the present study, was normally distributed. Another study limitation is that neither the questionnaire, from which the New Nordic Diet (NND) score is derived, nor the score itself, has been validated. However, regarding food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s, validity studies are generally difficult to carry out because of the lack of a perfect standard reference method (32), and difficulties of obtaining sufficiently large and representative samples of the population to which the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) may be applied. In addition, the New Nordic Diet (NND) score inquires dietary behavior rather than absolute intake, making validation even more challenging.",450ed0ad-3dd0-4fd9-949e-37134f3370cd
18,discussion7," Although quantification of foods in the questionnaire probably would result in greater accuracy, it would also increase participant burden.  In terms of the study sample, number of participants is a limitation because approximately 100 subjects, as used in other studies, would have been preferable (32, 39, 40). Moreover, the generalizability is limited due to the low response rate, and further characteristics of the parents who signed up, the majority of whom were female, ethnic Norwegian, and higher educated. Also, because the participants were relatively young and well-educated parents of small children, they could be more motivated than other populations regarding diet, nutrition, and health issues in general, which may result in reliable and repeatable answers, and thus an overestimation of the true reliability of the New Nordic Diet (NND) score.",8c8f70b0-e2d8-48e8-ba77-07844e41d06f
19,discussion8," Considering previous study results (30, 31), and the general difficulties of measuring dietary intake (32), we believe that the misclassification of 31% of the participants from test to retest reflects the sources of error that are likely to be an inevitable part of dietary research. Nevertheless, such errors represent limitations that need to be taken into account when interpreting study results. The aforementioned characteristics of our study sample may entail that the sources of error could be more pronounced than what we have captured in the present study. Regarding the time interval between the test and the retest administrations of the questionnaire, 2 weeks is relatively short, implying that the participants might remember what they answered in the first questionnaire, which in turn would increase reliability due to memory, and not necessarily as a result of questionnaire performance.",3c26bd8c-5f61-43e6-9947-db808e95aa00
20,discussion9," Nevertheless, a great range of different time intervals between administrations has been used in previous studies (41). It should also be mentioned that not all foods typical for the New Nordic Diet (NND) are included in the score, for example, nuts and seeds, legumes, rapeseed oil, free-range livestock, fresh herbs, and wild plants and mushrooms (34), because of some limitations of the availability of food data. However, the score comprised most food items captured by the concept of New Nordic Diet (NND).  Conclusion Based on the acceptable test–retest reliability of the total New Nordic Diet (NND) score and its subscales revealed in the present study, together with previous study results, we believe that the New Nordic Diet (NND) score is qualified for ranking and segregating subjects according to degree of adherence with the New Nordic Diet (NND), and for detecting potential associations between degree of compliance with various health outcomes.",21bd653c-822f-40b4-8c89-c0ad927b478d
