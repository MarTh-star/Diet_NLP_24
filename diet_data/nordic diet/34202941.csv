0,background0," The rapid neurodevelopment that occurs during the first years of life hinges on adequate nutrition throughout fetal life and early childhood. Therefore, adhering to a dietary pattern based on healthy foods during pregnancy and the first years of life may be beneficial for future development. The aim of this paper was to investigate the relationship between adherence to a healthy and potentially sustainable Nordic diet during pregnancy and in early childhood and child development.

1,methods0," This study is based on the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and uses data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN)). In 83,800 mother-child pairs, maternal pregnancy diet and child diet at 6 months, 18 months and 3 years were scored according to adherence to the New Nordic Diet (New Nordic Diet (NND)). New Nordic Diet (NND) scores were calculated both as a total score and categorized into low, medium, or high adherence. Child communication and motor development skills were reported by parents at 6 months, 18 months, 3 and 5 years, using short forms of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire and the Child Development Inventory. Associations of New Nordic Diet (NND) adherence with child development were estimated with linear and logistic regression in crude and adjusted models. ",61929542-edc2-4958-8750-7df338dc02d3
2,analysis0," Linear regression and logistic regression analysis with robust standard errors were employed to compute crude and adjusted estimates of associations of maternal and age-specific child New Nordic Diet (NND) scores with measures of child development from 6 months to 5 years. Both methods were applied to establish a potential positive linear association between the New Nordic Diet (NND) scores and child development scores, and to examine whether scoring in the low New Nordic Diet (NND) score-categories was associated with developmental delay as expressed by scoring 2 standard deviations (SD) below or lower than the mean developmental score. The given cut-off allows for identification of the lowest scoring individuals within the sample, although the cut-off is not clinically validated for assessment of a specific developmental delay.",a61f039b-5c57-4031-8663-b00c55ffa60d
3,analysis1," The distribution of child development scores was highly left skewed with more than 90% of the children scoring within the 90th percentile range at each timepoint. After carefully considering the consequences of comparing exposure and outcome measurements which both had a different number of items and showed different range and SD at the different timepoints, we concluded that longitudinal analysis methods would not be suitable for this study. Instead, we performed cross-sectional analyses on the relationship between exposure and outcome at each timepoint and investigated potential trends and patterns in the results.  In the linear regression model, the percentage of maximum scoring for the developmental outcome and New Nordic Diet (NND) scores were computed to give more comparable results across timepoints. For the logistic regression models, the child development scores were dichotomized with 2SD below the mean as cut-off.",c48928ea-3db6-46e1-9a06-cab34c8c2f8b
4,analysis2," Developmental score values at -2SD of the mean score or lower were assigned the value 1 (poor outcome), and the rest given the value 0. For these analyses, the values of the New Nordic Diet (NND) score categories (high/middle/low) were reversed with the low New Nordic Diet (NND) adherence group being assigned the value 2 and the high adherence was given the value 0 (reference group). More than 10% of the mothers participated more than once in the study and to correct for a possible impact of sibling covariance, we used robust cluster variance estimation in all analyses. The statistical programs, SPSS version 22 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and STATA/SE 16.1 were used for the analyses. ",147eac9a-54f4-40fe-9fe4-a97170332cec
5,results0," Basic maternal and child characteristics of the study sample are described in Supplementary Information (SI). In previous research, we have shown that mothers with high New Nordic Diet (NND) adherence during pregnancy were older, more educated and of higher parity than those with low New Nordic Diet (NND) adherence [18]. They were less likely to smoke, more likely to be normal weight and to exercise compared to women with low New Nordic Diet (NND) adherence.  Number of participants included in the analyses and properties of the New Nordic Diet (NND) scores and child development scores are listed in Table 2. The percentage of children scoring lower than the cut-off of 2SD below the mean developmental score ranged from 3.5% (18 months) to 5.2% (6 months).",621b562a-6f79-47b9-bc82-56654ca7d8a6

12,discussion0," In this study, we report relatively consistent and robust findings that a healthy diet in early life is positively associated with measures of child development. The robustness of the results was confirmed by analyzing the data both as continuous and binary variables. Despite the crude way of scoring healthy food intake in the diet score development, we found an overall positive association between higher New Nordic Diet (NND) score and scoring better on child development measures, including communication and motoric assessment in this cohort. We also found that being in the low New Nordic Diet (NND) adherence group yielded higher odds of delayed development (developmental scores <−2SD) compared to high New Nordic Diet (NND) adherence in a dose-response fashion. These associations were found at nearly all measured timepoints of dietary exposure from pregnancy to 6 months, 18 months and 3 years with development at 6 and 18 months and 3 and 5 years.",042919f3-6d48-4c5f-9422-9b8458fb2755
13,discussion1," The findings are in line with other European studies which have found that higher adherence to healthy dietary patterns is associated with improved school performance [24] and higher childhood IQ [38]. We did not observe an association at 5 years (language) with high vs. low or medium maternal New Nordic Diet (NND) adherence, which could imply that other factors than maternal diet during pregnancy may be of more importance for language development by this age.  Previous studies in MoBa have shown that maternal diet quality described by various measures of a healthy diet, is associated with a decrease in ADHD symptoms and diagnosis at 8 years [39], and that higher maternal intake of unhealthy foods during pregnancy predict emotional problems among children at the age of five [40]. However, our study is, to our knowledge, one of few that has explored associations between both maternal and child dietary patterns and child communication and motor development at multiple timepoints.",af76e090-7e70-480b-9280-d3207dc09eea
14,discussion2," Showing robust associations with measures of diet quality over time from the fetal life in the womb until 5 years of age, reinforces the importance of overall diet quality, and probably specific nutrients, on child communication and motor development. This is corroborated by current knowledge that healthy dietary patterns may promote child neurocognitive development through changes in cellular processes, neuroplasticity, or epigenetic mechanisms, as stated by Tandon et al. [4, 5].  It should be noted that the observed associations showing higher development scores with healthier diet are found in a presumably healthy Norwegian population with no lack of access to healthy food, most parents able to afford a healthy diet for their child, and with dietary guidelines easily accessible.",f14f124b-2b69-4813-8400-31def11395c7
15,discussion3," This finding shows that a suboptimal diet can potentially provide limitations on a child’s cognitive development and is not confined only to developing countries [6, 41], but also holds for developed countries. A nation’s prosperity and health rely on the healthy development of their younger generations. Therefore, a larger focus on how to provide a healthy diet, is important in early childcare. Health authorities should take note that a healthy diet is important not only for short- and long-term health, but presumably for early cognitive and motor development as well. The diet scores applied in these analyses were constructed to capture potentially sustainable aspects of diet. Given the recent increased attention on the necessity of having more sustainable diets [12], the beneficial associations of higher diet scoring with aspects of child development have additional benefits that should also be conveyed to the public.",57f7626d-5f85-4b56-869c-d03eaedc0946
16,discussion4,"  Strengths and limitations  The strengths of the present study include the large sample size and prospective analyses linking diet and cognitive development at multiple timepoints from pregnancy throughout early childhood. Additionally, several potential confounders known to be associated with maternal and child diet and cognitive development were accounted for in the adjusted models. Nonetheless, there are several limitations to consider. Although the child diet scores were developed on the rationale of capturing a healthy, local, and potentially sustainable Nordic diet, the dietary assessment in the child questionnaires were not as comprehensive as in the maternal food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). This may have limited the child scores’ ability to truly reflect a sustainable diet with Nordic characteristics as intended. This is discussed thoroughly elsewhere [24].",ace143b5-d742-419f-abcd-9dae38f03dc7
17,discussion5,"  The New Nordic Diet (NND) scores are constructed to capture adherence to a healthy Nordic diet by measuring frequency of intake of some key healthy food items in the diet. As the diet scores do not measure unhealthy food items directly, a low score is characterized by having less of the healthy food items and therefore primarily reflects the consequence of not having these healthy food items in the diet. Moreover, the method chosen to define cut-offs for the New Nordic Diet (NND) categories may have contributed to misclassifications due to the arbitrary approach. On the other hand, the normal distribution of the scores was carefully interpreted when deciding the cut-off values. Furthermore, the use of median values as cut-off in most subscales of the age-specific diet scores were also data-driven based on dietary intake in the MoBa cohort, which may not be representative for the rest of the population.",a5079b69-3694-4bdc-a5bd-f0764ca5f507
18,discussion6," The mothers participating in MoBa were older (> 25), more often cohabitating and more frequent users of multivitamin and folic acid supplements compared to non-participating mothers in Norway [42]. Smokers and mothers with more than two previous births were underrepresented. Hence, self-selection bias and residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Also, with self/parent-reported dietary data, the possibility of misclassification to the score categories due to social desirability bias cannot be excluded.  The shortened and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ) subscales used in the MoBa holds another potential limitation. The MoBa questionnaires covered a multitude of developmental and mental health measures and provided limited space. The child’s age at completion of the questionnaires varied and the selected items would therefore be adequate for somewhat younger/older aged children as well. To account for this, the age at completion of the questionnaire was used as a covariate in the analyses.",a426a814-b69e-409f-94a6-ce7fbc6b407e
19,discussion7,"  The and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ) is regarded as an effective diagnostic tool of developmental delay and/or deviance [30, 35]. Yet, the shortened instrument used in the current study is limited to ascertain associations between differential diet quality and severely poor scoring (<−2SD) or higher scoring on and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ). The findings would translate to whether the child is reaching developmental milestones slower or faster than expected for the child’s given age. A low score (<−2SD) on the shorter and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ) is not necessarily reflecting a clinically defined developmental delay impacting the child’s daily functioning. For such a conclusion to be made, a more complete assessment would be necessary with broader developmental scales and parent-completed questionnaires on child impairment.",76a10ea7-0dd6-4117-b304-2ffafd4701a8
20,discussion8,"  Furthermore, both exposure and outcome variables examined in this study, differed from one-another at each timepoint, preventing us from assessing the relationship between a healthy and potentially sustainable Nordic diet and child development with repeated measures methods. The heterogeneity within the New Nordic Diet (NND) scores and the shortened and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ) limits the possibility to compare effect sizes across age-specific analyses, as they capture the New Nordic Diet (NND) and child development differently at each timepoint.  Finally, as the current study has data derived from an observational study, any causal interpretation cannot be ascertained. Still, it should be noted that although the effect size for most associations were small, they were remarkably consistent and perhaps likely to be of relevance in a public health perspective.",4276e11c-0817-4d7a-97c7-4b235f57b362

This association was found at several timepoints, from maternal diet during pregnancy to child diet at age 3 years. Our results highlight diet quality as a prerequisite for optimal development and reaching your potential, which is also relevant in developed countries, such as Norway. A higher focus on the relevance of diet for communication and motoric development beyond physical health and growth seems warranted.
