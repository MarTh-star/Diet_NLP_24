0,methods0,"2.1. Study Population The subjects included in this cross-sectional study belong to a subset of the “OMega-3 fatty acids in Elderly patients with Myocardial Infarction” (OMEMI; NCT01841944, Clinical-Trials.gov) cohort [8] at inclusion in the study. The protocol was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (ref. number: 2012/1422). Patients 70–82 years old were recruited at Oslo University Hospital Ullevål, Oslo, Norway, after a diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and were included in the study after 2 to 8 weeks of surviving the acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Patients were treated per guidelines with standard medication. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, cardiovascular history, classic cardiovascular risk factors, and current pharmacological treatment were obtained from all subjects using a standardized report form at inclusion.",5c6c7429-0e5b-443b-84e1-aee92b2c6063
1,methods1," A patient’s usual diet was recorded at study entry with the SmartDiet® questionnaire (version 3, from May 2009), which is a fast, simple, and validated tool for the assessment of food intake and diet quality, and results in a diet score [9]. As shown in Table 1, the SmartDiet score is built upon 14 questions relating to food quantity and quality, which are scored, summed, and categorized as unhealthy (≤ 27 points, group I), somewhat unhealthy (28–35 points, group II), or healthy diet (≥ 36 points, group III), according to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations. The study protocol was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and followed the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants signed their informed consent.  2.2. Blood Sampling Fasting venous blood was withdrawn into 3.8% sodium citrate tubes for MV analysis. Blood cells were removed by centrifuging whole blood 20 min at 2500× g at 4 ºC.",aa8c28f6-4d96-43a5-b9fe-e16777217bc0
2,methods2," Plasma was carefully recollected, leaving about 0.2 cm of an undisturbed layer on top of the cells, and aliquots were immediately frozen and stored at −80 ºC until processing for isolation and quantification of cMV. Additionally, biochemical and hematological parameters were quantified with standardized routine methods.  2.3. Circulating Microvesicle Isolation and Quantification The cMV fraction was isolated from citrated and anticoagulated plasma through a two-step high-speed centrifugation procedure. Five-hundred microliters (µL) of frozen plasma aliquots were thawed on melting ice and centrifuged again at 2500× g for 15 min at room temperature (RT) [10]. Then, 250 µL of plasma were collected and centrifuged at 20000× g for 30 min at RT to pellet cMV. The supernatants were discarded, and the cMV-enriched pellet was washed once with citrate-phosphate buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) solution (citrate-phosphate buffered saline (PBS); 1.4 mM phosphate, 154 mM NaCl, 10.",0de74f80-fd56-4527-84f7-1e153f611b90

Finally, the remaining cMV pellets were resuspended in 100 µL of citrate-phosphate buffered saline (PBS).  A triple-label flow cytometry analysis was performed as described before [7,11]. Briefly, 5 µL of washed cMV suspensions were diluted in 30 µL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing 2.5 mM of CaCl2 (Annexin Binding Buffer, ABB). Thereafter, combinations of 5 µL of allophycocyanin (allophycocyanin (APC))-conjugated Annexin V (AV, BD-horizon) with two specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb, 5 µL each, Table 2) labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)) and phycoerythrin (PE) (or the isotype-matched control antibodies) were added.  Samples were incubated for 20 min at RT in the dark and diluted with ABB before being immediately analyzed with the “Auto Collect” mode in 96-well plates on an AccuriC6 flow cytometer (BD, Accuri® Cytometers, Inc.",3fe34be5-3725-4e69-8280-087b74419f7b
4,methods4,", San Diego, CA, US), except for MV from smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which were quantified as previously described [6,7]. Specifically, for the detection and quantification of cMV from SMC origin, 5 µL of the cMV suspension were incubated for 20 min at RT in the dark with 5 µL of AV-allophycocyanin (APC) and 5 µL of CD142-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (tissue factor, TF) in a final volume of 50 µL ABB. cMV were fixed with 250 µL of ABB/paraformaldehyde 2% for 30 min and centrifuged at 20000× g for 30 min to pellet cMV. After eliminating the supernatant, cMV were permeabilized with 45 µL of ABB/saponin 0.1% for 20 min at RT in the dark. After permeabilizing, 5 µL of smooth muscle actin (smooth muscle actin (SMA))-α-PE were added to the cMV suspension, incubated for 20 min at RT in the dark, and finally diluted with ABB prior to flow cytometer analyses.  For all cMV characterization and quantification, acquisition was performed at 2 min per sample. The flow rate was set at 14 µL/min.",d1c131dc-9d85-48ae-a7f7-fabd11fa9049
5,methods5," Forward scatter (Forward scatter (FSC)), side scatter (side scatter (SSC)), and fluorescence data were obtained with the settings on the logarithmic scale. In addition, cMV were identified and quantified based on their binding to AV and their reactivity to cell-specific mAbs (Figure 1). To identify positive marked events, thresholds of fluorescence were set based on samples incubated with the same final concentration of isotype-matched control antibodies after titration experiments. The AV binding level was corrected for autofluorescence using fluorescence signals obtained with MV labeled with AV in a calcium-free buffer (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)). To reduce background noise, buffers were prepared on the same day and filtered through 0.2-µm pore size filters under vacuum.  Data were analyzed with BD CSampler software (version 1.0.264.21, Accuri® Cytometers, Inc.). The cMV concentration (number of cMV per µL of plasma) was determined according to Nieuwland’s formula [12].  2.4.",dca24652-8f6c-47ee-b5a4-b193583a4b92
6,methods6," Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS Statistical Analysis System (version 23.0, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics (mean ± SD or n (%)) were used to describe the characteristics of the patients and the outcome variables. The normality of the variables was assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk test. All variables with a skewed distribution were transformed into their natural logarithms for regression analyses. ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test or t-test analyses were conducted to examine the differences in MV concentrations related to cardiovascular risk factors and potential confounding factors and related to groups of the SmartDiet score. A linear regression was performed to investigate the specific influence of covariates in the relationship between diet and cMV.",cec8c80c-4133-40d7-8de1-3b44e2015776
7,methods7," According to the results, we performed Spearman’s correlations and multivariate linear regressions adjusted for age, sex, use of fish oil supplements, and smoking history to analyze the main associations between the SmartDiet score and cMV. A two-tail p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  3. Results 3.1. Patients’ Characteristics  Patients were divided into three categories according to the SmartDiet score, which was based on the usual intake of the different food groups included in the SmartDiet questionnaire. Group I was defined as ≤ 27 points (n = 39, 22.4%), group II as 28–35 points (n = 106, 60.9%), and group III as ≥ 36 points (n = 29, 16.7%) in the questionnaire, where the higher the score, the healthier the diet, according to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations [9]. Table 3 shows the characteristics of the 174 patients included in the study according to groups of score.",b59e1117-7890-4574-9df2-d9f339e89f44
8,methods8," Although cMV concentrations from endothelial cells, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes increased over time after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (not shown), the distribution of patients according to the weeks after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was homogeneous within tertiles of adherence to the Nordic diet. Therefore, no statistical interaction was observed between adherence to the Nordic diet and weeks after the acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at inclusion in the study, for the levels of cMV in the patients studied. The mean age was 75 years, and approximately 60% were hypertensive. Almost all patients were under statin and dual antiplatelet therapy (98% and 95.5%, respectively), 24% were diabetics, 10% were current smokers, and 50% of the study population used fish oil supplements prior to inclusion.  Figure 2 depicts the main cell origin of cMV.",0faa50e5-488e-4410-be54-bebe066ffd75
9,methods9," No significant differences were observed in the percentage of cMV from each cell origin or in clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients according to groups of diet score.  3.2. Food Items and SmartDiet Score In general terms, the mean score for each item (Table 4) was higher in group III compared to group II and group I, and also was higher in group II compared to group I for nearly each food item, except for the “mayonnaise, remoulade, and kaviar” and “sweet toppings and sweet drinks” food items, in which no differences were observed between the three groups of the SmartDiet score. Hence, patients in group III had a higher score for almost every food item (12 out of 14) of the questionnaire compared to patients allocated to group II or group I.  3.3.",bee9a096-494a-4e14-9492-9495a5785f23
10,methods10," Associations between Circulating Microvesicles and SmartDiet Score The Spearman’s analyses showed an inverse correlation between the SmartDiet score and total AV+, and CD61+/AV+ and CD31+/AV+ cMV, reflecting platelet activation (R = −0.162, −0.176, and −0.159, and p = 0.045, 0.029, and 0.049, respectively). Thus, the association between SmartDiet score and these cMV was further analyzed by linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, use of fish oil supplements, and smoking history. Multivariable adjustments did not significantly modify the observed results (Table 5).  As depicted in Figure 3, patients allocated at the highest score range (healthy diet) had significantly lower total (AV+) and platelet (CD61+/AV+ and CD31+/AV+) cMV (p = 0.028, 0.017, and 0.038, respectively, one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test) compared to patients allocated at the first and second tertiles of score.  4. Discussion 4.1.",d19eb2ef-fe9d-4c00-8e88-9ccc442bbfbb
11,methods11," Previous Knowledge A healthy diet should be the cornerstone of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. In this setting, a high adherence to the Nordic diet has been related to reduced blood pressure [13], improved blood lipid profile [14] and insulin sensitivity [15], improved endothelial function [2], and reduced low-grade inflammation [16]. However, this is the first time that high adherence to the Nordic diet, assessed through the validated SmartDiet questionnaire (which was particularly developed to evaluate a subject’s diet regarding risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the context of the Nordic diet), has been related to MV shedding.  4.2.",7c14a399-280a-41c3-a16d-f78c38b10b7f
12,methods12," Main Findings of the Study The main finding in this cross-sectional study is that patients with higher adherence to the Nordic diet presented around 32% lower levels of total AV+ cMV, 41% lower levels of CD61+/AV+ cMV, and 30% lower levels of CD31+/AV+ cMV, compared to patients allocated to the first and second tertiles of score, despite being under dual antiplatelet therapy. No differences in cholesterol levels were observed across tertiles of score, probably because almost all patients were under statin treatment, as per guidelines after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Taking this into consideration, this inhibitory effect on platelet activation may contribute to the beneficial effects of the Nordic diet, which is associated with reduced mortality in patients with established Cardiovascular disease (CVD) [17].",973ec35b-7de3-485b-9f72-fbbd160be9e1
13,methods13,"  Interestingly, the mean score for each item was higher in group III compared to group II and group I, except for two food items, in which no differences were observed between groups of the SmartDiet score. This observation indicates that the group classification from the SmartDiet questionnaire, at least within the patients included in the study, reflected a dietary pattern rather than high/low consumption of a specific/single food group. Although the SmartDiet questionnaire has been validated by dietary fat and fiber [9], the protective effects of the Nordic diet may be considered to be a product of the sum of healthy consumption of single food items and should not be only attributed to a single food or food compound.  4.3. Review of Previous Data  cMV were identified and quantified through AV binding, which has a high affinity for PS and therefore identifies PS externalization.",06cfe964-f958-4d01-a929-08ac8e9083fb
14,methods14," AV+ cMV expose PS on their surfaces, providing a catalytic surface for factor X and prothrombin activation, thus promoting thrombin generation and clot formation [18]. Besides the externalization of PS, which confers procoagulant activity to cMV, cMV were also identified and quantified on the basis of antigens from their cell of origin and on markers of cell activation. In this line, platelet-derived cMV, which contain epitopes and biomolecules from platelets such as CD61 and/or CD31 and account for 74% of cMV AV+, amplify platelet activity on coagulation cascade and leukocyte (and platelet) adhesion/activation [19], promoting inflammation and increasing platelet deposition on damaged arteries and thrombus formation [18], thus increasing the atherothrombotic burden [7]. In fact, total AV+ and CD31+/AV+ cMV map and predict coronary atherosclerosis and calcification in familial hypercholesterolemia patients [20], contributing to an increased risk of a major adverse CV event.",00210d31-c9bb-4d57-82dc-6f9d8c638852
15,methods15," Therefore, nutritional strategies to decrease total AV+ and platelet-derived cMV release may improve Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognosis.  Few studies have analyzed the effects of diet on MV release. Cocoa flavonols have been shown to decrease CD31+ cMV concentrations in patients with coronary artery disease after one month of intake [21], as did one month of an intervention with the Mediterranean diet in elderly healthy individuals [22]. Supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids has been shown to reduce CD31+ [23] and CD61+ [24] cMV concentrations, and replacement of saturated fats with monounsaturated and omega 6 fatty acids reduced the number of CD31+ cMV [25]. Taking into consideration that the Nordic diet is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, our observations are endorsed by the literature.  4.4. Limitations and Scope of Future Studies Our study is not exempt from limitations.",ca426d77-a416-485b-9f3a-889df02cb7e9
16,methods16," The current study was performed in elderly patients with a relatively recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and therefore, these findings may not be extrapolated to healthy subjects or to other acute myocardial infarction (AMI) populations. In addition, females accounted for only 29% of the study population, and thus sex-specific differences were not analyzed. This was an association study, and therefore it was hypothesis-generating. Although flow cytometry is the most widely used method for MV quantification and characterization, its limit of quantification is ranged between 0.1 and 0.3 µm of particle size. Therefore, MP populations below the limit of quantification were not considered and could be influenced by the Nordic diet quality.",0f1b39e6-2d79-420c-8f86-a14b67cc721e
17,methods17," Considering all of these aspects, future studies should be focused on the evaluation of the effects of the Nordic diet on MV shedding from different sizes and cell origins through randomized trials, in order to confirm a cause–effect relationship and the potential sex-specific differences in the observed effects.  5. Conclusions Dietary habits significantly affect MV shedding, known to directly influence cellular functions. This study showed that the higher the adherence to a healthy Nordic diet was, the lower the levels of total AV+ and platelet-derived AV+ cMV found in the circulating blood of Norwegian elderly patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The lower release of MV may potentially contribute to the beneficial effects of the Nordic diet. ",0078e2f7-b57a-4890-8f3e-ac4bc810fcb7
