0,introduction0," Cardiovascular disease (Cardiovascular disease (CVD)) is one of the most important causes of mortality. Healthy diets can decrease Cardiovascular disease (CVD)s and other chronic diseases especially in patients with type 2 diabetes. In this study, we investigate association between adherence to the modified Nordic diet and cardiovascular risk factors among patients with type 2 diabetes.     Type 2 diabetes usually results from reduced insulin secretion or decreased sensitivity to insulin. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that impacts various dimensions of health.1,2 According to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO)), globally 300 million people will suffer from diabetes by 2025.1 The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is high in Middle Eastern countries such as Iran.3 In Iran, recent statistics show the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among people between ages 25 to 64 years old was 7.7%.",067a0501-8db0-4e11-bcef-0c74dd371126
1,introduction1,"4 However, this is likely to be an underestimate, as there are also undiagnosed cases.4    Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Cardiovascular disease (CVD)), which is an important cause of death among type 2 diabetic patients.5 Blood glucose imbalance is also strongly related to increased risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD)s.5 Several environmental factors, including dietary intake, can affect the incidence of type 2 diabetes.6 Nutrition plays a key role in the prevention of type 2 diabetes and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Common nutritional protocols for prevention of type 2 diabetes emphasize consumption of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products and foods with reduced saturated fats.5 Currently, it is recommended that a person’s whole diet (in the form of a dietary pattern) be evaluated, rather than just one food or one food group.2,7 Indeed, detection of a protective dietary pattern to decrease type 2 diabetes is needed.",0d09d002-f9ce-4a92-a1be-968b347d08d4
2,introduction2," The Nordic diet is a dietary pattern referring to consumption of traditional foods from the Nordic countries (the Scandinavian region), including whole grains, fruits (such as apples, pears, and berries), low-fat dairy products, fatty fish such as salmon, cabbage and root vegetables.7,8 Several components of the Nordic dietary pattern including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and fish have been associated with lower risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD)s.7 The Nordic diet is based on organic foods and healthy fat, therefore it is lower in refined carbohydrates and foods lacking in nutrients and is rich in monounsaturated fats that promote heart health.7 Some studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of the Nordic diet on factors associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes as well as cardiovascular complications, such as body weight and insulin sensitivity.",9e913d37-554a-4ee9-acd8-fc18cc549400
3,introduction3," Despite some constrasting results, weight loss, reduced cholesterol, lipid profile, blood pressure, inflammation, and overall mortality, have generally been reported as resulting from compliance to this diet.2,7,9,10 While dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) are appropriate for glycemic control, modification of cardiovascular risk factors and prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, the Nordic diet also appears to be effective.5 Cultural and regional differences as well as level of food accessibility can lead to different dietary patterns in various populations and/or countries. Therefore, some Iranians adhere to dietary patterns similar to that of the Nordic diet.11 Given its widespread adoption and some of the beneficial effects of the Nordic diet, calls have been made for evaluating adherence to this diet and health status.",0be2fb93-487f-48cd-96b8-db0c5834a526

6,methods0," This cross-sectional study was conducted among 339 type 2 diabetic patients. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure, and biochemical tests were evaluated. A validated and reliable semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) was used to assess dietary intake. Nordic diet scores were calculated based on median intakes of six food groups.     This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study included 339 type 2 diabetic patients recruited between 2014 and 2016 from several therapeutic centers in Isfahan catoring to diabetic patients. As these clinics serve all parts of Isfahan, participants represented the full range of socio-demographic characteristics. Cluster random sampling methods were used to select participants.

However, in order to replace patients who were excluded due to under- or over-reported food intakes, we continued sampling until enrolling 339 individuals. Inclusion criteria included interest in participation, answering all of the questionnaire completely, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and age ≥30 years. Patients with other diseases such as thyroid disorders, Cardiovascular disease (CVD), liver and kidney disease, cancers as well as patients who were pregnant and lactating were excluded from this study.

Anthropometric assessments   All participants were assessed for anthropometric measurements including height, body weight, body mass index (Body mass index (BMI)) and waist circumference. Height was measured in the standing position, with shoes removed. Body weight was measured using digital scales while subjects were minimally clothed and were not wearing shoes. Waist circumference was measured where the waist was narrowest over light clothing. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg)/height2 (m). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured three times by a digital instrument after participants sat for 15 minutes.

However, there were no significant relationships between other Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and adherence to the Nordic diet, which was perhaps related to cross-sectional nature of the study.

This association was attenuated after adjusting for age, gender, and energy intake, but remained statistically significant (P < 0.05). Clearly, energy intake as well as sex impact weight gain and obesity. Women have more fat mass compared to men due to their physiological and hormonal characteristics. Also, women generally are more concerned about their body weight and shape.18 Darwiche et al reported that a 12-week modified Nordic diet led to significant reductions in WC.19 Moreover, there was a significant association between adherence to the Nordic diet and reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C in our study.",c93576ef-64fc-4f00-8c2b-1edbf7934382

Previous studies have shown a strong relationship between blood pressure and anthropometric indices such as Body mass index (BMI).20 Increased mass and higher Body mass index (BMI) lead to peripheral resistance, increased blood volume and cardiac output, all of which leads to hypertension.20,21 Darwiche et al. have shown results inconsistent with those of our study in that they observed a reduction in blood pressure in after a 12-week Nordic diet intervention.19 Consumption of the Nordic diet components including vegetables, rye, barley, oatmeal, apple, and fruits can be effective for reducing high blood pressure.",5731836a-e150-433c-a257-6f235cc2b710
26,discussion3," In the present study, dietary fiber and several dietary antioxidants were consumed in higher quantities among participants with the highest levels of adherence to the Nordic diet, which can play an important role in decreasing risk of high systolic blood pressure (SBP) and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C. It is well known that these foods increase both dietary fiber and antioxidants.    It has been shown that 2 to 10 g of dietary fiber can reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C concentrations.22 This has been attributed to the fact that dietary fiber reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C by binding to bile acids and decreasing fat absorption.22 Fiber can control weight gain and obesity by reducing caloric density of food intake and also slowing the rate of food ingestion. Monitoring carbohydrate consumption and especially intake of more whole grains are other means to control diabetes, due to the effects of macronutrient composition (e.g.",bec42e76-2e3d-4976-90c7-76be13fadbc8
27,discussion4," especially carbohydrate intake on glycemic index and glycemic load in patients with type 2 diabetes).23 Whole grains and legumes that contain fiber are inversely associated with obesity, Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, and diabetes. Indigestible carbohydrates can reduce metabolic risk factors and hyperglycemia.24,25 Also, increased fiber requires more chewing that slows the rate of gastric emptying through appetite signals triggered by the nervous system, which lead to more satiety.26 Because of lower carbohydrate consumption, protein intake is thought to be increased in the Nordic dietary pattern.19 In line with this, in our study, we found protein consumption was increased among participants in the highest tertiles of adherence to this diet. Macronutrients are other food components that can slow the rate of gastric emptying.",f57cb345-b523-4ed1-8ab1-1b67ad77fab9

These results are consistent with the those of Darwiche et al.19 Increased intake of n-3 monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and PUFA (n-3 mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids) in the Nordic diet is effective for decreasing low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C. A Nordic diet that includes high amounts of seafood and fish is expected to have high amounts of omega-3 and unsaturated fatty acids and has cardioprotective effects by reducing the lipid profile.28 A limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design which prohibits making causal inferences. Case-control and cohort studies may be needed to confirm these findings.",af46ce23-7694-4823-9935-362efb229285
29,discussion6," Also use of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s can result in under- or over-reporting of food intake. Moreover, because of low consumption of food groups associated with the Nordic diet in the Iranian population, we failed to create the original Nordic diet score and therefore created a modified score. A large number of participants and multicenter recruitment are strengths of this study.    In conclusion, it appears that adherence to the Nordic diet has considerable and beneficial effects on anthropometric indices and biochemical tests, however additional well-designed case-control studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.
