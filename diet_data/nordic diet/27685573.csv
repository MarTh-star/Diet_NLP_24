1,methods1," Corning CellBIND tissue culture plates were obtained from Corning Life-Sciences (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The protein assay reagent was obtained from BioRad (Copenhagen, Denmark). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. All solvents were of analytical grade and water was purified by a MilliQ system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).  3.3. Pressurized Solvent Extraction (accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE)) Frozen berries were smashed and lyophilized, then ground to a powder and extracted on an accelerated solvent extraction system, accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE) 350 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). For extraction, 12 g berry powder was mixed with diatomaceous earth (Dionex) (4:1) and loaded in a 100 mL steel cartridge. Extraction was performed in two cycles at 60 °C, the preheating time was 5 min and static extraction per cycle 5 min. The berries were first extracted with hexane followed by 80% methanol.",56da18b4-121f-4b09-9b4a-a98ab9530e56
2,methods2," Solvents were removed under vacuum to give the hexane and the methanol accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE) extracts.  3.4. Solid Phase Extraction (solid phase extraction (SPE)) of Berry Extracts The methanol accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE) extracts were purified by solid phase extraction (solid phase extraction (SPE)) using Strata C18-E 2 g columns (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK) according to McDougall, et al. [60] with some minor modifications. Briefly, the methanol accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE) extract (200 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL water containing 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)), filtered through a Pall® Acrodisc® 32 mm syringe filter, 0.45 µM (Pall Corporation, Newquay, UK), and applied on the column equilibrated with 0.2% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The column was washed with 2 × 10 mL 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to remove the unbound material (e.g.",57e0cc9d-6351-4cdd-a8ff-5db79960c80c
3,methods3,", free sugars), then the phenolics were eluted with 2 × 10 mL methanol containing 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and the methanol fraction taken to dryness in a Genevac vacuum centrifuge (Genevac, Ipswich, UK) to give the solid phase extraction (SPE) methanol extract.  3.5. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was conducted on a Bruker AVII 400 (for accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE) extracts) or a Bruker AVII 600 (for solid phase extraction (SPE) extracts) instrument (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). Dried berry extract (ca. 20 mg) was dissolved in methanol-d4 containing tetramethylsilane (tetramethylsilane (TMS)) as reference and filled in 5 mm nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tubes. Spectra were acquired with 128 scans, at 25 °C. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were processed by the MestreNova software Version 11.0 (Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Compostela, Spain).  3.6.",e43875b8-67af-4cd7-b941-05d4b0051a5e
4,methods4," Total Phenol Content Test substances were dissolved in DMSO and the Folin–Ciocalteu assay was carried out as previously described [61]. The absorbance was measured at 765 nm on a Biochrom Libra S32 PC UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK). A linear calibration curve for gallic acid was obtained in the range 0–25 µg/mL to calculate the amount of gallic acid equivalents (gallic acid equivalents (GAE)) in each sample.  3.7. 15-Lipoxygenase (15-LO) Inhibition Test substances were dissolved in DMSO and the assay was carried out as previously described [61], measuring the formation of conjugated dienes as increase in absorbance at 234 nm on a Biochrom Libra S32 PC UV/Vis spectrophotometer.

6,methods6,"5 mM glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and penicillin (100 units/mL) at 37 °C in 5% CO2.  3.12. Glucose Uptake in HepG2-Cells Cells were exposed to test samples dissolved in DMSO and diluted in the HepG2 cell medium and incubated for 24 h. The final DMSO concentration was 0.1% in both the DMSO control and test samples. Thereafter, cells were exposed to d-[14C(U)]glucose (1 μCi/mL, 100 μM) for 4 h. A 96-well UniFilter-96 GF7B microplate was mounted on top of the CellBIND plate and CO2 production was measured. After incubation the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)), lysed in 0.1 M NaOH, and radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation counting [63]. The protein content of each sample was determined and the glucose uptake was calculated using protein levels for standardization [45].  3.13.",0d3b3edd-8c94-4248-b813-680223b44890
7,methods7," Statistics The results from the Folin–Ciocalteu, 15-LO, XO, α-amylase and α-glucosidase assays are the averages of three parallels ± SD. Data and figures for glucose uptake are given as mean (±SEM) from n = number of separate experiments. At least three parallels were included in each experiment. Comparisons of different treatments were evaluated by two-tailed and paired Student’s t-test.  4. Conclusions As far as we know, this is the first study comparing the antidiabetic potential of 14 different Nordic berries. The phenolic rich extracts from these berries have a strong effect against α-amylase and α-glucosidase and a positive influence on glucose uptake in human liver cells in vitro. The chlorogenic acid rich rowanberry solid phase extraction (SPE) extract and the anthocyanin rich bilberry solid phase extraction (SPE) extract showed the highest stimulation of glucose uptake in the human liver cells.",bfb04a1c-a8e1-49c9-99d9-3d55f60df224
8,methods8," The crowberry solid phase extraction (SPE) extract showed the strongest inhibition of 15-LO, while the bog whortleberry solid phase extraction (SPE) extract was the strongest XO inhibitor; both were rich in anthocyanins. The crowberry extract, both among the accelerated solvent extraction system (ASE) and the solid phase extraction (SPE) extracts, showed the strongest α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition.  The polyphenols present in these berries are extensively metabolized in vivo by the gut microbiota, suggesting that the accumulation of multiple phenolic metabolites is important after oral intake of berries, as well. The metabolism and bioavailability of polyphenols is complex, and to address whether it is the native polyphenols in the gut, the microbial metabolites in the gut, or absorbed metabolites that are the most important for health beneficial effects is still under debate. Synergistic effects are also plausible [64,65,66].",8cead6a2-117a-4665-af7d-56309267d8a9
9,methods9," Therefore, it is difficult to point out which substances are the most important after consumption of these Nordic berries. Based on the presented study we can say that the phenolic compounds, either individually or combined, might be important for both enzyme inhibiting activities and for glucose uptake in liver cells, and therefore also for the potential health beneficial effects of berries.  The antidiabetic property of the berry extracts increases the nutritional value and indicates a potential as functional food against diabetes. However, long-term clinical studies that include substantial amounts of berries in an otherwise healthy diet may be required to confirm the contribution of berry consumption to the prevention of T2D and cardiovascular disease.
