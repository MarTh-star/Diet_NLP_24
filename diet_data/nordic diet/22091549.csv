0,background0,"High-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD)) mouse models are invaluable tools for clarifying the development of obesity at the tissue level. The C57BL (black) strain is the most widely used inbred strain highly susceptible to high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and hyperglycemia, and serves as a background strain for numerous transgenic mouse models [1–3]. When nearly half of the energy in the mice’s diet is derived mainly from saturated fat, these mice readily develop obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Prolonged high fat diet (HFD) and its modifications lead to increased systolic blood pressure and impaired lipid and glucose homeostasis, and this model has been widely used to study type 2 diabetes (T2D) [3–5].",0c129a25-ad15-4d1e-bcb3-ecea24d9a143
1,background1," Obesity has been linked to several ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, microvascular complications, age-related macular degeneration (age related macular degeneration (AMD)), and diabetic cataracts [6], but the associations remain unclear and sometimes inconsistent. high fat diet (HFD)s increase features associated with dry age related macular degeneration (AMD) in aged mice or when consumed for long periods [7], but short-term changes in mice have not been fully explored. Furthermore, high fat diet (HFD)s are generally used in combination with other challenges to mimic features of dry age related macular degeneration (AMD), whereas overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor or laser treatment have been used to create choroidal neovascularizations and thus to develop models of wet age related macular degeneration (AMD) [8].",8b615da2-9f55-4569-aad9-dbbad2040c30
2,background2," Retinal gene expression studies have identified several genes involved in inflammation, the antivascular barrier, and neurodegeneration with increased apoptosis and vascular permeability with streptozotocin (streptozotocin (STZ)) induced diabetic rats [9–11]. In addition, genetic Ins2Akita- or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice also have neurovascular and inflammatory genes associated in the progression of diabetic retinopathy [12,13]. Therefore, inflammatory components appear to play a crucial role in the development of obesity-associated ocular diseases, but as far as we are aware, no studies on retinal gene expression patterns after an high fat diet (HFD) have been published previously.  Bilberries are rich in polyphenols, especially anthocyanins, which belong to the flavonoids [14,15].",d8da84e7-3c96-4f51-a285-b03407f056f0
3,background3," Bilberries are generally recognized as low energy foods, containing little or no saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, and as a good source of dietary fiber and antioxidant vitamins E and C. The anthocyanins are the most abundant flavonoids present in bilberries and have been shown to be potential antioxidants [16]. These compounds can penetrate the nervous system even after short-term feeding [17], and they have been reported to be able to reduce age-associated oxidative stress and the related cognitive decline [18]. Furthermore, anthocyanins displayed the potential to ameliorate cardiovascular diseases [19] and obesity-related pathological changes in rodent models [20–23], but findings using whole bilberries as anthocyanins sources have not demonstrated similar efficacy [24–26].",eba3e267-7745-4cf2-84d9-4a94c992fb75
4,background4," Due to their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties [27,28], anthocyanins and their extracts may have potential benefits in eye health [29–31], neural functions [32] and age-related retinal stress [33].  In this study, we used microarrays combined with a well characterized mouse model to screen for the genes expressed in the retina that could potentially explain the effects of bilberries in the diet at the early stage of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. As far as we are aware, this is the first study using 45% kcal from an high fat diet (HFD) and mice to study the short-term effects on retinal gene expression. ",92a49486-517d-4e34-a203-530426a9f024
5,methods0,"Animals and study design Mice (male C57BL/6J, n=24) 6 weeks of age were obtained from the animal center of the University of Eastern Finland and randomly divided into four groups (six mice per group) and housed in pairs. They were kept in a constant environment at 21 °C with an automated 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle: 7:00–19:00 day (light), 19:00–7:00 night (dark). The mice were fed ad libitum for 12 weeks with a normal control diet (normal control diet (NCD); 10% kcal fat), high-fat diet (high fat diet (HFD); 45% kcal fat), or these diets supplemented with 5% (w/w) of freeze-dried bilberries (BB), and had free access to tap water. The fat content in the high fat diet (HFD)s was increased by the addition of lard, a rich source of saturated fat. The berry diets were prepared by the manufacturer (Research Diet, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) to match the respective controls in terms of the carbohydrate (sucrose and cellulose) and potassium (potassium citrate) content.",c1648bb6-ffaf-4f9f-8e17-66f149b6f94d
6,methods1," The Finnish national food composition database (Fineli®) was used for estimating the nutrient content of bilberries. The energy nutrient contents of the diets are shown in Table 1 and in detail as provided by the manufacturer in Appendix 1. The anthocyanin contents of the freeze-dried berry powder and the BB diets were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography as previously described [34] and expressed as mg/g diet as anthocyanidin (aglycon) equivalents. Feed and water consumption of each cage were monitored for three 5-day periods (weeks 2, 6, and 12), and the average feed intake was used to calculate the anthocyanins and energy intake.

7,methods3," Briefly, the mice were acclimatized individually to the measurement conditions (restrainers and warming) for 2–3 days and trained for 5 days with sham measurements before data were collected from 10 repeated cuff measurements in prewarmed restrainers at 32 °C at the same time of day using an automated inflation system (IITC Inc. Life Sciences, Los Angeles, CA). Data collected from at least two measurements with <15% coefficient of variation of the mean were used to obtain an average systolic blood pressure (mmHg) and heart rate (HR, pulse per minute) for each mouse.  The mice were euthanized at the end of the feeding trial following 1–2 h fasting using CO2 gas asphyxiation until loss of vital signs before cervical dislocation. Both retinas were removed under a light microscope and found to be free of pigmentation (retinal pigment epithelium [RPE] cells). Samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before RNA was extracted.",6fe841e2-d8d8-40c2-a940-f0799f3377bb
8,methods4," Whole blood glucose was analyzed with the One Touch Ultra glucose meter and strips (Life Scan, Milpitas, CA). Serum samples were collected in Microvette CB 300 capillary tubes (Sarsted, Nümbrecht, Germany) after 3 min centrifugation at 12 000× g to determine free fatty acids (free fatty acid (FFA)s) with a standard enzymatic protocol with Konelab 20XTi analyzer (Thermo Electron Corp., Vantaa, Finland). All blood and tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and aliquots stored at −70 °C.  The study protocol was approved by the Finnish National Animal Ethics Committee in the State Provincial Office of Southern Finland, adherent to the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) and comparable to the guidelines published by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research.  RNA extraction and microarray transcriptomics Total RNA was extracted from both retinas of four mice per group using QIAzol and cleaned up with the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).",4b798225-41e7-4657-b765-7289fd376586
9,methods5," The biotinylated cRNA was pooled. Isolated RNA and cRNA concentrations and quality were checked with Nanodrop (ND-1000, Wilmington, DE). The quality was controlled with BioRad’s Experion electrophoresis station at the Finnish Microarray and Sequencing Centre (FMSC, Turku, Finland) before hybridizations. The raw and normalized data are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)) Gene Expression Omnibus (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)) with the series accession number GSE34154.  In brief, the RNA was isolated from homogenates in 1 ml of QIAzol lysis reagent, and RNA extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol (RNeasy Lipid Tissue Handbook) with the additional Dnase step (Qiagen’s Rnase-Free DNase Set). The Dnase-treated RNA was eluted in 50 μl of water and amplified and biotinylated overnight (15 h) with Ambion's Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Austin, TX). Pooled cRNA 750 ng from four samples (187.",6d307f58-1e93-4b9b-ab4f-08784360deec
10,methods6,"5 ng) per group was hybridized at 58 °C overnight (19 h) to each array using the standard Illumina protocol with 1 μg/ml streptavidin-Cy3 detection (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). The Mouse-Ref8 V2 R0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA; Platform GPL6885) were scanned with the Illumina Bead Array Reader and results extracted with BeadStudio v3.3.7 (Illumina Inc.).  Illumina bead array data and gene set enrichment analysis Bead-level data were extracted from the bead array scans and summarized using Illumina BeadStudio software without any normalization or background correction. The resulting gene-specific bead-summary data were used as the basis for the gene expression analyses in the statistical programming language R, primarily using beadarray [36] and limma [37] packages from the Bioconductor project [38].",7aa20af9-67a2-489c-a432-cca23a0a9847
11,methods7,"  For each group, we used the control probe signal intensities (Biotin, Cy3 hybridization efficiency, housekeeping genes, labeling efficiency, low stringency hybridization efficiency, and negative controls), box-and-whisker plots of all log2 expression values, M versus A plots of all possible combination of arrays, and hierarchical clustering at the array level to check for batch effects and other technical biases. After quality control, the bead summary data were reannotated using the most recently available annotation, and normalized using quantile normalization.  Gene set enrichment analysis (Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)) was performed with significantly differently expressed genes (p<0.05, n=810), using the functional annotation tools available from the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)).",4f0faab0-5274-4479-9528-490d4ab86fd8
12,methods8," Pathway analysis on the same set of genes with various approaches was performed in PathVisio and Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID).  We used the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation tools [39] to obtain a global overview of the biologic processes that have been regulated by the diets. First, enrichment for all Kyoto Encyclopedia Gene and Genomes (Kyoto Encyclopedia Gene and Genomes (KEGG)) pathways was determined with overrepresentation analysis using Entrez gene ID annotations. Next, a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed. We focused on biologic processes and molecular functions present in the so-called GO Fat set created by Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). This set attempts to filter the broadest terms so that they do not overshadow the more specific terms, which is a common problem in GO enrichment analysis.",c5147def-9ad4-481e-b003-a49349c1716e
13,methods9," Since there is no measure for the specificity of each GO term, the term specificity is based on the number of child terms, which enables filtering of the broadest terms in the hierarchy. Further analysis of differentially regulated pathways in diet groups was performed in PathVisio using Kyoto Encyclopedia Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and WikiPathways [40,41] and Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) using Kyoto Encyclopedia Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathways.  The results of the gene expression analyses are presented in tables of gene set enrichment analyses and as tables of pathways possibly affected by diet (z-score >2) with approaches (limits in p values and fold changes) that are defined in the tables and in the Results. For clarity and the availability of gene expression analysis tools, the Entrez gene ID annotated data are presented unless stated otherwise. ",c84e4be1-2139-4fb3-8339-475f71aa5f38
14,analysis0,"Due to the small sample size, we devised an ad hoc statistical test in the microarray analyses to identify genes of interest. The statistical significance of gene expression changes was estimated by calculating the ratio of the between-treatment and the within-treatment variance for each gene. The bead intensity variance of each gene for each treatment group, as returned by BeadStudio (Illumina Inc.), was used as an estimate of the within-treatment variance. The resulting ratio was used as an F-test statistic with the degrees of freedom set to the average number of beads used for each gene. P-values were calculated and Bonferroni’s correction method used to reduce the number of false positives. Due to the pooled nature of the microarray data, this rough ad hoc approach was chosen to increase the identification of differentially expressed genes between different diet groups rather than depending solely on fold changes.",d510147b-5514-4d8a-8ded-c5f8aa8d8667
15,analysis1,"  The statistical significance of phenotypic parameters was tested between the high-fat or normal control diet groups combined and the bilberries or no bilberries groups combined using the Mann–Whitney U-test, and significantly different parameters were further tested between each diet to their corresponding control followed with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple testing in SPSS (v.17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The differences between the compared groups were considered statistically significant when p-values were less than 0.05. ",e7bb4143-2c96-4309-9302-edbd669cf8ed
16,results0,"The effect of an high fat diet (HFD) on phenotypic parameters was first evaluated to examine the efficacy of the mouse model. When all mice (n=24) were grouped according to the fat content of the diets (high fat diet (HFD) and high fat diet (HFD)+BB versus normal control diet (NCD) and normal control diet (NCD)+BB), there were significant differences in weight between these combined groups from week 5 and in several other parameters at the end of the study (Figure 1, Table 2, Table 3). The mice on the high fat diet (HFD) with or without bilberries had significantly increased energy gain (p=0.011), final weight (p=0.004), and weight gain (p=0.005), elevated levels of blood glucose (p=0.018) and serum free fatty acid (FFA)s (p=0.027), as well as increased systolic blood pressure (p=0.045).

19,results4," However, no differences were observed in the average feed intake, energy intake, or weight gain in the middle (week 6) or during the 12 weeks of feeding compared to mice not fed with bilberries (Figure 1, Table 2). The bilberry diets (normal control diet (NCD)+BB and high fat diet (HFD)+BB) contained 0.92 and 0.83 mg/g anthocyanins and consequently provided 2.94 and 2.66 mg/d of anthocyanins, respectively.  Bilberries in the diet had no significant effects in phenotypic parameters but tended to lower blood pressure (−12 mmHg, −11%) and increase free fatty acid (FFA)s (+0.1 mmol/l, +8%) and blood glucose levels (+1.8 mmol/l, +14%) in mice fed with the high fat diet (HFD) (Table 3).

These molecular functions and biologic processes were furthermore found in high fat diet (HFD) upregulated genes when compared to genes downregulated by high fat diet (HFD)+BB versus normal control diet (NCD) (161, 77). Altogether, the high fat diet (HFD)+BB group showed similar genes (crystallins) differentially regulated compared to either background diet, and six of these genes were expressed with ≥2.",2a770b40-cca8-4988-86c8-0c058eaacf53

Bilberry induced gene expression changes in high-fat-diet downregulated genes in the retina If one examines the high fat diet (HFD) downregulated genes that were upregulated in high fat diet (HFD)+BB versus high fat diet (HFD) (222, 12), the apoptosis pathway (four genes, p=0.081, 3.9 fold enrichment) was shown with a probe for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) also recognized in the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathway. high fat diet (HFD) downregulated and high fat diet (HFD)+BB versus normal control diet (NCD) upregulated only a low number of genes (128, 0) that were enriched within two pathways: colorectal cancer (four genes, p=0.022, 6.5 fold enriched) and melanogenesis (four genes, p=0.032, 5.6 fold enriched).

Bilberry induced gene expression BB in both diets (normal control diet (NCD)+BB to normal control diet (NCD) and high fat diet (HFD)+BB to high fat diet (HFD)) increased the expression of 204 genes enriched in the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathway (histone clusters 1 H2aa, H2ad, H2af, and H4k and histone cluster 2 H2ac; p=0.016, 5.",62b92fb1-48a2-47d8-b8d4-47dd85662b33

These consistent changes in gene expression, induced by BB in opposite direction to the high fat diet (HFD)-regulated genes, clearly point to diet-dependent transcriptional regulation and furthermore were not attributable to the control diets.

35,discussion0,"Obesity and diabetes are well recognized risk factors for ocular diseases. Several disease models in rodents have been successfully created to study obesity-associated phenotypic changes at the tissue level. The most commonly applied models of diabetes involve streptozotocin (STZ) treatment that evoke compromised glycemic homeostasis and thus represent a model of type 1 diabetes resulting from decreased insulin secretion due to gradual pancreatic beta-cell death. By using streptozotocin (STZ) in rodents as well as genetic models, numerous advances have been made in the pathology of diabetes and age-related progression of retinal disorders. However, only a few studies have used C57BL mice with an high fat diet (HFD) to evaluate the retinal gene expression changes related to the gradual progression of diabetes. In this study, we used the microarray screening approach and identified similar changes in crystallin expression as found in the previous models using streptozotocin (STZ).",5f91293a-3a56-4f90-bfa4-d4b358c5928d
36,discussion1," We also show how bilberries rich in anthocyanins, known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, seem to counteract the major gene expression changes found in mice retinas due to consumption of an high fat diet (HFD). The differences in phenotype parameters and in the expression of transcripts in mice retinas between the high fat diet (HFD) and the normal control diet (NCD) with or without bilberries will be discussed here to explore the possible effects of bilberries at the molecular level.  Phenotype The high fat diet (HFD)- and high fat diet (HFD)+BB-fed mice exhibited increased weight from 5 weeks of the trial and had elevated weight gain and systolic blood pressure as well as higher free fatty acid (FFA) and non-fasting blood glucose concentrations.",a7f75140-be62-4435-a622-9d07df0fe450
37,discussion2," Due to the small number of mice and the high variation, statistically significant differences were only partly observed between the high fat diet (HFD) and normal control diet (NCD) groups after correction for multiple testing. Nevertheless, the mice fed the high fat diet (HFD) in the present study can be regarded as being in a prediabetic state. The mice fed high fat diet (HFD)+BB displayed increased weight gain and reduced systolic blood pressure at the end of the study; these findings were similar to those previously reported [24,42]. Increased weight gain could result from the improved peripheral insulin sensitivity reported after treatment with anthocyanins [43] or consumption of blueberries [44], since increased insulin sensitivity is known to lead to increased energy storage.",be3f73c4-d7e6-4931-a4b0-1e1b468a764a
38,discussion3," In conclusion, the possible changes in retinal gene expression induced by bilberries cannot be attributed to blood glucose levels or other phenotypic differences between groups since these parameters were apparently not affected by the inclusion of bilberries in the diet.  Retinal gene expression The retinal gene expression studies in diabetic rats and mice revealed changes in inflammatory, antivascular barrier, and neurodegenerative genes associated with increased apoptosis and vascular permeability [9,10,12,45,46]. The previous studies used either streptozotocin (STZ) triggered type 1 diabetes (T1D) in mice and rats or the genetic T1D mouse model strain, Ins2Akita [47]. Our results provide additional screening data since mice fed an high fat diet (HFD) generally display gradual changes in inflammation, glucose, and lipid metabolism leading to T2D.",45047278-adea-46bb-84c5-d263b5563851
39,discussion4," We found differential expression of genes in the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), apoptosis, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and particularly in the transcripts for crystallins. Overall, the gene expression changes due to diets were evenly distributed between up- and downregulated genes as previously described [12]. In a microarray experiment (12 weeks), strain C57BL/6J mouse models of streptozotocin (STZ) and Ins2Akita mice (GSE19122) induced changes in 333 and 404 probes related to 307 and 392 differentially expressed genes evenly distributed between up- and downregulated genes in these two diabetes models, respectively (p<0.05 and >1.4 FC). Despite finding fewer changes than in the other diabetic mouse models, our results were also evenly distributed with a total of 91 (76) high fat diet (HFD) upregulated and 61 (57) downregulated probes (and genes) within the 810 (683) differentially expressed transcripts (p<0.05, ≥1.3 FC).",79b0495b-24c7-45f8-acc1-7963cc90d0ee
40,discussion5," This can be explained by the statistical approach and the use of pooled samples, and thus there is less statistical power than in previous studies.  High-fat diet induced gene expression In our study, crystallins displayed the highest increase in high fat diet (HFD)-associated gene expression. Crystallins were initially isolated as structural proteins in the lens, but their expression has been observed in the mouse retina [48]. Alpha crystallins are molecular chaperones, acting as regulators of apoptosis and vascularization in the retina, and they are closely involved in neuronal inflammation and oxidative stress resistance [49]. Whereas the alpha crystallins are recognized as small heat shock proteins, beta and gamma crystallins are less known for other than their structural role in the lens.",718361f7-1236-4c5a-8a94-af1c32b8cdfa
41,discussion6," Nevertheless, beta and gamma crystallins have also shown increased gene expression in animal models of retinal diseases or stressed conditions, for example, diabetic retinopathy and light-induced damage [50,51]. Not only differently regulated crystallin transcripts but also the actual proteins have been identified in retinas of diabetic mice, i.e., the Ins2Akita strain and in the C57BL strain after streptozotocin (STZ) treatment [13], as well as in rats [52,53]. Furthermore, increased levels of alpha-crystallins have been determined in diabetic humans [54]. The increased subtypes, i.e., alpha, beta, and gamma crystallins observed in diabetes, are expressed in glia cells (alpha) and neurons (beta, gamma) [49]. In diabetes, the antiapoptotic functions of alpha-crystallins in the retina have been shown to be disrupted, leading to controlled neuronal cell death [13].",906ba70e-c94d-4f85-9218-5b13a9669918
42,discussion7," In our study, the high fat diet (HFD) increased the expression of crystallins beta A1 A2, A4, and B2 and crystallins alpha A and gamma S. We also found enrichment of the apoptotic pathways, which were among the genes affected by the high fat diet (HFD), to further support the proposal that the high fat diet (HFD) model may possess similar gene expression characteristics in rodents as in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced or Ins2Akita mice exhibiting the diabetic phenotype.  Within the high fat diet (HFD)-induced pathways such as T2D, Gap junctions and CAMs have also been identified in previous studies with other mouse models. Gap junctions are involved in neuronal coupling of cones, rods, and amacrine cells in the retina [55], and tight junctions are associated with CAMs in the blood–retinal barrier (blood–retinal barrier (BRB)) of endothelial cells.",5e382e80-901e-4694-9803-4d509ffc1ace
43,discussion8," The breakdown of the blood–retinal barrier (BRB) following vascular leakage has been proposed to be involved in the pathogeneses of diabetic retinopathy, ischemic retinopathies, and macular edema. The blood–retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is thought to consist of two alternative pathways, one involving endothelial cell tight junctions and the other mediating vehicle transport by caveolae. The altered gene expression evoked by streptozotocin (STZ) pointed to transient changes in paracellular and prolonged disruption of vesicular transportation causing the increased permeability found in retinal capillaries in preclinical diabetic retinopathy [10]. Furthermore, the blood–retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown in diabetic retinopathy has been shown to require TNF-α [56]. A previous study using mice fed an high fat diet (HFD) (21% fat, 12 weeks) observed increased expression of Tnf-α, and a modest increase in the expression of P-selectin and E-selectin [46].",c742c953-65d6-4631-9c6a-e1f93264ea70
44,discussion9," If one considers the genes involved in the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), Lgals3bp has been a common gene upregulated in two mouse models of diabetes [12], and was potentially upregulated in this study. Tnf-α has been found as a common gene in several high fat diet (HFD) affected pathways but was not upregulated in this data set. Nevertheless, one must be cautious in interpreting dietary effects on individual genes without applying other molecular approaches. These results merely indicate a possible change in these pathways and the average change in genes within these pathways.  The most predominant pathways observed in all groups were the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, although found within the high fat diet (HFD) upregulated transcripts. These both indicate that innate and adaptive immune responses were affected by the high fat diet (HFD).",7447fe18-be98-42c2-9af2-8082a2fe046d
45,discussion10," Previous studies have detected changes in retinal gene expression related to inflammation in diabetic models [12,46]. An high fat diet (HFD) has increased the expression of Tnf-α, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam-1), interleukin-6, and interleukin-1-beta in the retina [46], and network analyses of two mouse models centered on p38mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Ins2Akita) and T cell receptor (T cell receptor (TCR)), interferon (IF)-alpha, and beta (streptozotocin (STZ)) in mice [12]. Parainflammation has been described in the progression of age related macular degeneration (AMD) [57], diabetic retinopathy [58,59], and obesity [60], and the transcripts in aging and diabetic retinas have been shown to share commonalities [45].",fbd77530-5c79-4b51-ba8f-da02faabfe89
46,discussion11,"  Bilberries potentially modify retinal gene expression Genes associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were found in the pathways affected by high fat diet (HFD)+BB, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with respect to normal control diet (NCD)+BB. Tnf-α, a commonly observed transcript in the previous pathways, and vascular endothelial growth factor, a highly relevant transcript according to previous studies, were both downregulated in the BB diets. However, the most enriched and interesting gene group, while acknowledging the study design limits, was the significant downregulation of crystallins in the BB in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice to high fat diet (HFD). As described in the high fat diet (HFD)-induced transcripts, especially alpha crystallins have been detected in rodents [13,49,52,53] as well as in post-mortem retinal samples of diabetic patients [54].",ef652712-3521-459d-aadf-9f0c0a5014dd
47,discussion12," Furthermore, these proteins have been shown to have a functional role in regulating apoptosis in diabetic mice [13]. Moreover, differently regulated pathways of high fat diet (HFD)-induced mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and apoptotic pathways were both found to be enriched in downregulated genes from animals on the BB diets. The results may be evidence of the dampening of the expression of genes involved with these pathways. The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathways were induced by bilberries commonly in the opposite direction to high fat diet (HFD) alone, but in contrast to the mechanisms involving oxidative stress, they have not been elucidated before in the retina in such detail. Nevertheless, extracts from bilberries have displayed anti-inflammatory properties and been able to protect photoreceptor cell function in a mouse in vivo model of endotoxin-induced uveitis [30].",c0fa20f6-f5f1-4848-bebf-bb13545fb705
48,discussion13," Therefore, further clarification of these pathways would be clearly beneficial.  However, the most convincing commonly upregulated pathway by the BB diets was the glutathione metabolic pathway. Upregulation of this pathway is in accordance to previous in vitro and in vivo findings. The bilberry anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, and malvidin) have well known neuroprotective properties in mouse retinal ganglion cells in vitro and in vivo [61], in vitro human RPE cells [62], and in rabbit models [63] in combating reactive oxygen species–induced damage. Even short-term exposure to anthocyanin or non-anthocyanin phenolic fractions of bilberry extract has increased the activities of oxidative stress defense enzymes of heme-oxygenase (HO)-1 and glutathione S-transferase-pi (Gst-pi) in human RPE cells [64]. Bilberry extracts have also increased glutathione levels and the gene expression and activities of total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in mice [29–31].",19598f06-16b6-441f-bde7-06ed47d22350
49,discussion14," In the present study, the genes for Gst and Gpx were found within the BB-upregulated and high fat diet (HFD)-downregulated pathway of glutathione metabolism. Therefore, bilberries may indeed possess the activity to induce the antioxidant defense pathways.  As far as we are aware, the current study represents the first screening of short-term obesity-related changes in the retina using a high-fat diet, i.e., 45% energy from fat. Although the mouse model used in this study is well characterized and uses an open source diet, two additional issues in gene expression analyses have to be considered before drawing any final conclusions. The retinal isolates are multicellular samples representing the average expressional difference of genes from several cell types in the intact retina, and second, the microarray samples are pooled and represent the average gene expression from four mice.",9e75ef7c-3144-43ba-b2e3-c85b0bf52964
50,discussion15," Nonetheless, our data point to a similar progression of molecular events as have been described with other mouse models of diabetes and obesity. We have shown that bilberries apparently counteract the increase in crystallin expression evoked by an high fat diet (HFD). Other bilberry-specific changes may include inducing genes in the oxidative stress–related pathway, e.g., glutathione metabolism, and they may be responsible for the antioxidant properties of these berries. In addition, dampening of the apoptosis and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related pathways may be beneficial in preserving ocular health. These findings still need to be further verified and explored in protein levels but clearly demonstrate the potential efficacy and molecular mechanisms of bilberries for maintaining the health of the eye.",d2e45410-9280-453c-b8a5-64a5c5d07200
51,discussion16," Thus, bilberries represent a highly promising source of compounds for protecting the retina from the harmful, inflammatory, and oxidative stress–related effects of diets rich in saturated fat. ",c8d014cc-7830-4691-b094-6d2d386a4fa8
