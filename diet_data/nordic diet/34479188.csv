0,methods0," Design  We followed the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions [41], with results reported according to Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (Meta analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE)) [42] and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta analyses (PRISMA)) [43] guidelines (see electronic supplementary material [ESM] Table 1). The protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04094194).  Data sources and searches  We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to 9 March 2021 (ESM Table 2). Manual searches supplemented these database searches.  Eligibility criteria  We included prospective cohort studies of Nordic dietary patterns and CVD and diabetes outcomes with a duration of ≥1 year, and RCTs of Nordic dietary patterns and intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes with a duration of ≥3 weeks.",853e413d-4ca0-458d-9319-7ef434693a24
1,methods1," Populations had to have diabetes but be free of CVD for assessment of CVD outcomes, be free of diabetes for assessment of diabetes outcomes, and have diabetes or risk factors for diabetes for assessment of intermediate outcomes. Prospective cohort studies were excluded if they did not report outcome data by level of exposure using an index or scale. RCTs were excluded if they lacked a suitable comparator diet (non-isocaloric). If more than one report was available for the same study, then the report with the longest follow-up was used. There were no language restrictions (ESM Tables 3 and 4).  Data extraction  Two reviewers (PM and EV, AJG, LC or AZ) independently extracted the data. The reviewers extracted RRs and 95% CIs for the most adjusted model from prospective cohort studies and mean differences (MDs) and SEMs from RCTs. MDs for change were preferred over end values. Missing SEMs were derived from available data using published formulae [44].",aa9c4270-69a6-44eb-8206-f8045f1f0e33
2,methods2," Ritz et al [45] were contacted for missing data. All disagreements were reconciled by consensus or arbitration by a senior reviewer (TAK, JLS)  Outcomes  The primary outcome was total CVD incidence in prospective cohort studies and LDL-cholesterol in RCTs. Secondary outcomes were CVD mortality, CHD incidence and mortality, stroke incidence and mortality and type 2 diabetes incidence in prospective cohort studies, and other established lipid targets (non-HDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides [TG], apolipoprotein B [ApoB]), markers of glycaemic control (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin), adiposity (body weight, BMI, waist circumference [WC]) and inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]) and blood pressure in RCTs.  Risk of bias  Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS)) [46] was used to assess the risk of bias in prospective cohort studies.",7e372c32-d9cc-4021-b7ff-4c55b2df7a98
3,methods3," Studies with a score of ≥6 out of 9 were considered to be of high quality. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in RCTs [47] across five domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting). ",6afbff1c-9acb-48d4-9345-941235e9fd58
4,analysis0," Pairwise meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). All other analyses were performed using Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).  Data were pooled using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models. RR estimates were obtained from natural log-transformed RRs and their SEMs comparing the highest with the lowest diet scores in the most adjusted models; MDs were obtained by pooling MDs and SEMs. Hazard ratios and odds ratios were treated as RRs [48]. Paired analyses were conducted for crossover trials (correlation coefficient=0.5) [49]. Fixed-effects models were used when fewer than five comparisons were available [50].  Interstudy heterogeneity was estimated using the Cochran Q test and quantified by the I2 statistic. An I2≥50% and pQ<0.1 were considered evidence of substantial heterogeneity. Sources of heterogeneity were explored in sensitivity and subgroup analyses.",4db4ff53-fcbc-44da-ac44-a04f7d07a5af
5,analysis1," Sensitivity analyses were conducted by the systematic removal of each study and recalculation of the pooled estimate. Sensitivity analyses by energy control were conducted by restricting analyses to ad libitum (free intake without strict energy control) trials for adiposity outcomes. If ten or more comparisons were available, subgroup analyses were performed by meta-regression. A priori subgroup analyses were conducted by follow-up, sex, risk of bias and funding source for prospective cohort studies, and by study design, follow-up, comparator, baseline values, risk of bias, diabetes duration and funding source for RCTs.  We performed dose–response meta-analyses (DRMs) using one-stage random effects [51–53]. Nordic dietary pattern scores were scaled or standardised to the Nordic diet score, with a range between 0 and 6 [54]. Linear DRM was expressed per 1-point score, and global DRM was assessed using the non-linear association at the highest global population adherence.",e2e6e4d6-ec27-4258-be60-3b06208c2968
6,analysis2," DRMs were planned for RCTs when adherence scores were available for six or more study comparisons.  If ten or more comparisons were available, publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and formal testing with the Begg and Egger tests [55, 56], with significance set at p<0.1. The Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill method was used to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry [57].  Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment  The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach [58–73] was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. The evidence from prospective cohort studies was classified initially as being of low certainty and that from RCTs was classified initially as being of high certainty, with the evidence downgraded or upgraded based on prespecified criteria.",5c3a09b7-9cbc-45e9-9dbd-777780b836f0
7,analysis3," Criteria for downgrading included study limitations (high risk of bias), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity: I2>50% and pQ<0.10), indirectness (presence of factors that limit generalisability), imprecision (95% CIs cross prespecified minimally important differences [MIDs]) and publication bias (detection of small-study effects). Criteria for upgrading included a dose–response gradient, large magnitude of effect (RR≥2 or RR≤0.5; prospective cohort studies only) and attenuation by plausible confounding. We interpreted the magnitude of the effect/association [74] based on prespecified criteria using MIDs and adapted Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) thresholds using the following language: ‘trivial’, ‘small important’, ‘moderate’, ‘large’ and ‘very large’. At the request of the referees, we also performed a post hoc assessment of the certainty of the evidence using NutriGrade [75]. ",8dc97d6b-5888-4985-a2e3-61f79f73d3cd

Other secondary outcomes showed trivial reductions or no effect.  Findings in the context of the literature  We are not aware of any previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies of Nordic dietary patterns; however, our findings agree with those of previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of key foods that are emphasised as being part of Nordic dietary patterns. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that total fruit and vegetable intake is associated with reductions in CVD, CHD and stroke incidence and/or mortality, with the greatest benefits found for certain root vegetables (i.e. carrots) and cruciferous vegetables (including cabbage) [96].",6c20018d-9ae0-4f5c-aaa4-365bfc6c7493
32,discussion2," Other key components of Nordic dietary patterns, including whole grains (oats and rye) [97, 98], fish [99] and legumes [100], have been associated with reductions in CVD, stroke and cardiovascular mortality and/or incidence of type 2 diabetes.  Our findings also agree with and expand on those of several previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs of Nordic dietary patterns and intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes. Three systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs found reductions in SBP associated with Nordic dietary patterns [37, 101, 102]. One systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs showed similar reductions in blood insulin levels but not blood glucose levels [38]. A second showed similar reductions in body weight but not BMI and WC [39, 103]. A third showed no effect of Nordic dietary patterns on inflammation, which agrees with our finding of no effect on CRP [40], although a single RCT did report interleukin-1 receptor antagonism [95].",7a8bdb97-fbee-4900-9433-80023bd925a2
33,discussion3,"  There are several possible explanations for the observed benefits of Nordic dietary patterns. One is the concordance of Nordic dietary patterns with Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH), Portfolio, healthy vegetarian and low glycaemic index/load dietary patterns, which are associated with improvements in clinical cardiometabolic outcomes and intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes [3, 10–12, 104–107]. Key foods shared with these other dietary patterns [27, 30] have also been shown to improve intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes. These foods include viscous fibres [108, 109] from oats and barley [110, 111], temperate fruit and berries [112, 113], nuts [103, 114–116] and legumes [117–125]. Another possible explanation for the observed benefits of Nordic dietary patterns is because of weight loss induced by the interventions.",a2b17fc4-6609-42c7-86a8-3ece7b501215
34,discussion4," Most of the included RCTs, however, adjusted for weight [28, 94] or BMI [91, 93], indicating that effects were largely independent of weight loss.  Strengths and limitations  The present systematic review and meta-analysis has several strengths. It provides a comprehensive synthesis of the currently available evidence on the potential role of Nordic dietary patterns in both patient-important and surrogate CVD outcomes. We used a systematic search strategy to capture all pertinent prospective cohort studies and RCTs. We explored dose–responses in prospective cohorts, which highlighted a significant linear protective association of Nordic dietary patterns with CVD outcomes.",55da7fac-42f3-42f9-882a-6a9683ce363d
35,discussion5," We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and performed a post hoc analysis using NutriGrade (although the latter was not used to inform our assessment of the certainty of the evidence as it was not prespecified or endorsed by the guidelines committee).  Several limitations were identified in the available evidence. First, there was evidence of serious inconsistencies. We observed substantial unexplained heterogeneity in the primary outcomes, total CVD incidence in the prospective cohort studies and LDL-cholesterol in the RCTs, and in several of the secondary outcomes in the RCTs. Second, there was evidence of serious imprecision. We observed imprecision in the primary outcomes, total CVD incidence in the prospective cohort studies and LDL-cholesterol in the RCTs, and in several of the secondary outcomes. Finally, there was some evidence of indirectness.",7528dba9-050a-435e-a2c8-a4b4bf4a66a6
36,discussion6," Different criteria were used to define Nordic dietary patterns, which may have contributed to the heterogeneity observed. We downgraded the evidence for HbA1c because of serious indirectness, as data were available from only a single RCT of a single Nordic dietary pattern (Danish official dietary guidelines), limiting generalisability to other Nordic dietary patterns. We did not, however, downgrade the evidence for other outcomes because of the use of different definitions of Nordic dietary patterns, as the evidence appeared robust to the different definitions. Another potential source of indirectness was the inability to isolate the effects/associations in diabetes. Prospective cohort studies did not provide subgroup data by diabetes status, and none of the RCTs included individuals with diabetes.",4dc8c5fa-a880-43cb-aa4d-316f38cea124
37,discussion7," We did not downgrade for indirectness here, as the prospective cohort studies did include a representative proportion of individuals with diabetes and the RCTs included individuals at risk for diabetes. The key components of Nordic dietary patterns have also been shown individually to lower cardiometabolic risk factors reliably in people with diabetes [108–126].  Implications  Dietary interventions remain the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes and CVD prevention and management [127–129]. Clinical practice guidelines for obesity, type 2 diabetes and CVD have shifted from focusing on single nutrients to focusing on dietary patterns [127–129].",58b671fd-13e2-4e14-8bdf-2056df9f967e
38,discussion8," Nordic dietary patterns ( ≥25% energy as whole grains, ≥175g/day of temperate fruits, ≥150–200g/day of berries, ≥175g/day of vegetables, legumes and canola oil, three or more servings/week of fatty fish, two or more servings/day of low-fat dairy products) [95] have important similarities (with some differences [130, 131]) to other established dietary patterns that are high in plant foods such as the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH), Portfolio and vegetarian dietary patterns. Population intakes of Nordic countries, as well as other European countries, Canada and the USA, do not meet the targets for these other dietary patterns [125, 132–135]. Nordic dietary patterns may provide a promising alternative to help individuals in Nordic countries and elsewhere achieve the cardiometabolic benefits of dietary interventions. This approach may have impacts beyond health [136, 137].",9428f35f-8e22-4c13-9b33-039d8ebc1595
39,discussion9," As pointed out by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the Nordic nutrition recommendations will be the first nutrition recommendations integrating environmental health with personal health [137].  Conclusions  Adherence to Nordic dietary patterns is associated with generally small important reductions in major CVD outcomes and incidence of diabetes and similar or greater reductions in LDL-cholesterol and other intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes. Our confidence in the evidence is generally low to moderate, with the evidence for reductions in clinical outcomes from prospective cohort studies supported by reductions in intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes from RCTs.",a11517f8-b66c-469d-8cd4-703c75cf8637
40,discussion10," Although there is a need for more long-term RCTs using standard definitions of Nordic dietary patterns that assess the effects on clinical outcomes and intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes (especially HbA1c) in diabetes, the available evidence provides a generally good indication of the likely benefit of Nordic dietary patterns in adults with or at risk for diabetes.
