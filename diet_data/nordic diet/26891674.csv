0,background0,"In September 2015, the Global Burden of Disease Project demonstrated that dietary risks (including high intake of red meat and sugar-sweetened beverages and low intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and poly-unsaturated fatty acids) contributed to the largest proportion of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally for both women and men [1]. Thus, dietary risks are today more important for health than high blood pressure, high body mass index or smoking. In total, it is estimated that 11.3 million deaths occur annually because of dietary risks [1]. Also in Sweden, dietary risks contribute to the largest proportion of DALYs [2]. Unfortunately, trends in dietary intake in many parts of the world are towards what has been called “the Industrial Diet”, i.e. a diet characterized by highly processed foods with a high content of saturated fat, sugar and salt and a low content of dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals [3].",470630a2-9cfb-4af1-9aed-6681a45937d2
1,background1," It is therefore important that longitudinal changes in dietary intake of populations are monitored, if we are to understand the association between dietary risks and health outcomes and to be able to reverse the worrisome trend.  Few population-based studies with detailed information on dietary intake and health exist and especially where diet intake has been monitored repeatedly in the same individuals. The Northern Sweden Diet Database (Northern Sweden Diet Database (NSDD)) is the largest such database, based on one population, in Europe (http://www.biobank.umu.se/biobank/biobank---for-researchers/northern-sweden-diet-database/), with detailed information on over 100 000 unique individuals. Approximately one third of them have participated a second time 10 years after the first visit, thus creating a unique cohort with repeated diet and health information.",4fbbc890-872c-428a-8c23-d41e47f854d5
2,background2," The aim of the current research was to report on longitudinal changes over a 10-year period in dietary intake for almost 16,000 individuals with complete data, and to evaluate associations between individual changes in dietary components of special health relevance and cardio-metabolic risk factors at the second study visit.  Research design and methods Study population The Västerbotten Intervention Programme (Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP)) is an ongoing, population-based prospective study. Dietary intake data from participants of Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) makes up the major part of Northern Sweden Diet Database (NSDD) [4]. Since 1985, inhabitants of Västerbotten County in northern Sweden (total population about 255 000) have been invited by their local health center for a medical examination when turning 40, 50 and 60 years old. In some communities, 30 year-olds were also included until 1996 [5].",286fb9eb-336c-4e73-bbff-7af5551bd548
3,background3," Over the years, between 48 and 67% of available inhabitants have participated in Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) [6]. Little evidence of selection bias has been found [7] and cancer incidences in the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) cohort and in the general population of Västerbotten are basically identical, indicating a truly population based cohort [8].  Diet measurements At the visit, participants donate fasting venous blood samples and fill in an extensive diet and lifestyle questionnaire [9], including a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) that covers the preceding 12 month period [10]. Initially, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) included 84 food items but from 1996 a short 64, 65 or 66 food item version was implemented. This reduction was achieved by deleting entire foods that were less common (e.g. liver and kidney) or in a few cases by merging similar food items.",1d3504b5-5551-4ba8-91b7-7b8fa483c0eb
4,background4," For the current analyses, only participants with the 64 item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at both baseline and the follow-up were eligible.  In the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), frequency of intake is reported on a 9-level scale from “never” to “≥4 times per day”. Daily intake in gram/day has been calculated by multiplying reported frequency of intake by a portion size value using the national food composition database [11]. Portion sizes for staple food, meat and vegetables are estimated from color photographs of four plates of increasing portion sizes. For other foods, sex- and age-specific average portion sizes as reported in a validation study in a subset of Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) participants using 24-h recall interviews [10] or as reported by the Swedish Food Agency [12] have been used. In addition to the validation study by 24-h recall interviews [10, 13], the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) also has been validated by serum biomarkers [14, 15].",f4be32a0-aa76-451b-9591-2c257a03db20
5,background5,"  A Healthy Diet Score that reflects healthy eating habits was calculated as previously described [16]. Briefly, frequency of intake per day was calculated for eight food/beverage groups. Favorable food groups included fish, fruits (except juices), vegetables (except potatoes) and whole grains. Unfavorable food/beverage groups included red or processed meats, desserts and sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and fried potatoes. Intake frequencies were ranked within each sex in ascending quartile ranks for favorable foods/beverage groups, and in descending quartile ranks for unfavorable foods/beverage groups. The sum of all quartile ranks represents the Healthy Diet Score, with a minimum of zero and a maximum of 24 and with higher ranks indicating healthier food and beverage choices.",5bc2364e-6922-451c-aac3-0cd26792d17e
6,background6,"  Further, a Dietary Inflammatory Index (Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)) was calculated as suggested by Shivappa and colleagues [17], but modified to fit the population under study (Bodén S, personal communication). Here, 30 food parameters available in the data from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were used, out of the 45 food parameters suggested by Shivappa and colleagues [17]. First, individual intake of the 30 food parameters were expressed as z-scores relative to global intake data provided by Shivappa and colleagues. In this modified version of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), contributions from coffee and caffeine in tea were combined into one caffeine parameter although tea was also kept as a food parameter of its own. Thereafter, estimated inflammatory contributions of each food parameter were calculated, based on literature-derived overall inflammatory effect-values also provided by Shivappa and colleagues.",dffe10ac-2eff-4177-bfa6-d77fc6f74691
7,background7," Food parameters known to contribute to inflammation yield positive values and food parameters known to prevent inflammation yield negative values. Finally, contributions from all consumed food parameters were summed to a final Dietary Inflammatory Index, with low values representing anti-inflammatory actions and high values representing pro-inflammatory actions.  Lifestyle and health variables Physical activity was measured using the Cambridge index of Physical Activity [18]. This is a validated index based on one question on occupational physical activity and one question on leisure time physical activity. Participants were categorized into inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active and active, respectively. Smoking was categorized into current smoker, ex-smoker, and never smoker, respectively. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides were measured at the health centers using a Reflotron bench top analyzer (Boerhinger Mannheim GmbH Diagnostica, Germany) until September 9, 2009.",d0def634-b17c-4802-a4f7-05789933c221
8,background8," After that date, measurements were performed using an enzymatic routine method at the Department of Clinical Chemistry at the nearest hospital. Serum cholesterol values measured with Reflotron were calibrated to values corresponding to the enzymatic method using the algorithm: cholesterolcorrected = 0.738 + (0.901*cholesterolReflotron). Similarly, serum triglyceride values measured with Reflotron were calibrated to values corresponding to the enzymatic method using the algorithm: triglyceridescorrected = 0.888 + (0.139*triglyceridesReflotron). Blood pressure was measured once, after 5 min rest and in supine position, using a sphygmomanometer.  Sample selection Between January 1990 and January 2014, in total 40,066 unique individuals had two visits recorded in Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP). Among these, all individuals who at both visits had filled in the short version of the food frequency questionnaire (64–66 items; see below) were selected (n = 17,461).",ca887ebc-9cbd-4f61-adb9-e14eaa5ba5d6
9,background9," Thereafter, 125 individuals were excluded because of too short or too long interval between the two visits; for these analyses intervals between visits were restricted to 10 ± 1 year only. The study sample thus included 17,336 individuals who had a first visit during 1996–2004 and a second visit during 2005–2014.  Among these 17,336 individuals, additional exclusions took place for the following reasons: individuals with >10% of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) missing (n = 171 for first visit and n = 273 for second visit; n = 419 unique individuals excluded), individuals who had not filled in the three pictures indicating portion sizes (n = 145 for first visit and n = 168 for second visit; n = 263 unique individuals excluded) and individuals with food intake level (FIL; calculated by dividing reported total caloric intake with estimated basal metabolic rate [19]) below the 1st percentile or above the 99th percentile calculated separately by sex,",c8358b74-01a4-4728-879a-592d5e12205a

Some individuals were affected by only one of these exclusion criteria and some individuals were affected by several of them. In total, n = 16,019 individuals had acceptable dietary information at both visits. Further, body weight (kg) and height (m) were measured in light clothing without shoes, by trained nurses using standardized weight and measuring scales. Body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) was calculated as weight/height2. Individuals with weight < 35 kg, length < 130 cm or body mass index (BMI) < 15 were excluded, rendering a final data set for analyses of n = 15,995.",5addf500-e87a-4b2b-b6a5-c158161e3cb5
11,background11,"  Data analysis Mean values and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for intake of dietary components as well as Healthy Diet Score and Dietary Inflammatory Index for both sexes at both study visits, adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI) quintile within sex and year of examination. Intakes of dietary components were expressed as grams per day as well as percent of energy (E%). Intake of whole grain was expressed as gram per day as well as gram per 2000 kcal. To evaluate selection bias, socio-demographic characteristics and dietary intake data were compared between the study sample of n = 15,995 individuals and the entire Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) study population of n = 33,109 with at least one study visit during the same time period and applying the same exclusion criteria with respect to dietary intake data and anthropometry.",d69b3c8a-45ba-4747-82a8-687416eabc23
12,background12,"  For the study sample, percent change over the 10 year period and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of intake of dietary components, expressed as E%, were calculated by sex and age strata (30, 40, 50, or 60 year-olds at the time of the first visit), adjusted for sex-specific body mass index (BMI) quintile and year of examination.  Finally, multivariable regression analyses were performed with body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides or systolic blood pressure at the second study visit as outcome variable, respectively, representing important cardio-metabolic risk factors. Ten year percent changes in dietary components of special relevance to health (whole grain, poly-unsaturated fatty acids (poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)), cholesterol, trans-fatty acids and sucrose) were evaluated as exposure variables.

Therefore, separate models were run with either cholesterol or trans-fatty acids as exposure variable. Finally, separate models for Healthy Diet Score as well as Dietary Inflammatory Index were evaluated, as these capture many aspects of the diet on their own. The regression models were all adjusted for values of the cardio-metabolic risk factor, year of study participation, age, education, smoking status and physical activity at the first visit. In sensitivity analyses, models were run with 10-year changes (as absolute values and as % change) in body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides or systolic blood pressure as outcome variable, respectively; these results were basically identical to the analyses described above and are not shown.",822b7d67-5369-40a0-9375-672334f4043a

18,results4," Further, proportion of total energy intake from both saturated fat and poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) increased for both sexes, whereas proportion from trans-fatty acids decreased. Proportions of saturated fat and poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from total fat intake hence remained unchanged over time for both sexes. No substantial change in Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) over time was noted for either sex. As expected, no group-level change in Healthy Diet Score was found and this reflects that the score represents a mean of all ranks within the group at each time point.Table 2 Intake of nutrients and diet indexes among the 15,995 Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) participants with 10-year follow-up dataa   Item	Women (n = 8,354)	Men (n = 7,641)	 At first visit	At second visit	At first visit	At second visit	 Energy (kcal/day)	1546 ± 424	1368 ± 394	2033 ± 610	1854 ± 575	 Protein (g/day)	55.7 ± 16.9	53.6 ± 17.3	70.0 ± 22.6	68.8 ± 23.4	 Protein (E%)	15.0 ± 2.1	16.",f20b6dc1-06ed-44af-84ca-f2335783d655

Methodological concerns and limitations Evaluation of Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) participation has concluded that there is little evidence of selection bias and that the cohort is truly population-based [7]. The current study focuses on the sub-sample with two study visits available, 10 years apart. Comparison of this sub-sample with all Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) participants with at least one study visit during the same time period did not reveal any substantial selection bias, except that the very small sub-sample of 60 year-olds at first visit differed somewhat from their age-matched counterparts in the general Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) population. Hence, our study sample may be regarded as population-based, except for the oldest age group.",f4635cf3-107f-4b3e-9535-35ce5d559015
29,discussion2,"  All age groups of both sexes, except the small group of 60 year at baseline, reported a lower energy intake at the second visit. This is likely due to a more pronounced under-reporting, in light of the increased body mass index (BMI) together with increased level of reported physical activity at the second visit. A possible reason for this finding may be the trend of larger portion sizes over time in Sweden as well as other rich societies [20]. Portion size trends are not captured in the diet intake assessment methodology used in the present study, where portion sizes for foods other than staple food, meat and vegetable either were calculated from the validation study performed in 2002 or derived from national standard portion sizes. Another reason for increased under-reporting over time may be that newer food items are not captured by the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).",fae19336-e604-4a50-abf6-a1bc41630c54
30,discussion3," Due to the change in reported energy intake over time, changes in diet components over time are in the presented analyses expressed as energy percent or per 2000 kcal.  Statistical analyses of nutrition intake are faced with the challenge of collinearity among many variables. In the current analyses, intake of cholesterol and trans-fatty acid exhibited strong correlation. Hence, separate models were run for these dietary exposure variables. However, remaining nutrient variables in the models may exhibit some collinearity that may mask true associations of the exposures on the health outcomes investigated. At the same time, other lifestyle factors such as physical activity and smoking are commonly associated with diet quality. While adjusting for these potential confounders, the true effects of the diet exposures might have been further masked.",74718d71-2440-48e4-ad1c-ebf874e86a9a
31,discussion4," We demonstrated several significant associations between diet exposures and cardio-metabolic risk factors and, if anything, these associations would thus be underestimated. Also, diet intake data were collected with the use of an food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that should reflect diet intake during the past 12 months. As with all retrospective data collection, recall bias is possible in that individuals affected by ill health may report their previous exposure differently hence attenuating any true association between diet and health.  Further, in the present analyses, we have not adjusted for use of cholesterol lowering medications. It is possible that participants who were informed of high serum cholesterol values at first study visit started medications thereafter, leading to spurious associations between change in serum cholesterol values and any change in diet.",e7b4b94b-16c0-4cc3-a354-18a69b26f36b
32,discussion5," However, in our previous publication on cross-sectional trends in diet intake and health in this population, we demonstrated that adjustments for use of cholesterol lowering medications had virtually no effect on estimated levels of serum cholesterol [4]. Still, the possibility of this kind of bias in the current longitudinal analyses must be kept in mind.  Strengths of the current study include that it represents a large population-based cohort with little evidence of self-selection, where exposure and outcome data have been collected with thoroughly validated methodology that has been consistent over the two time-points of measurement, 10 years apart, for all individuals.  Results in relation to published studies The present study of longitudinal changes in dietary intake prospectively confirms most cross-sectional dietary intake trends that we have previously reported for the period 1986–2010 in the same population [4].",35110d39-297f-44eb-9a66-5c89b8cd34f6
33,discussion6," Also in the cross-sectional data, increased proportion of total energy intake from total fat and saturated fat concurrent with decreased proportion of total energy intake from carbohydrates were demonstrated for both sexes. Similar results of decreasing intake of carbohydrates and increasing intakes of fat over time were recently reported from the German National Nutrition Survey [21]. Most other European studies reporting on time-trends of consumption rely on repeated cross-sectional surveys, in line with our previous report [4]. Recently, results were published from a Belgian longitudinal study of 197 women and 373 men with repeated measurements 10 years apart on dietary intake, expressed as three dietary indices, and anthropometry and blood lipid levels [22]. Here, a significant association between increases in dietary indices and anthropometric parameters was found in men only, whereas no significant associations were found with blood lipids.",7c2496d1-1e99-4848-a49d-7cc68cdd282f
34,discussion7," Perhaps the sample size was too small to detect significant associations among the women; also, changes in the diet indices over time may have been too small.  Of interest to note were the differences in reported diet changes by age group. For both sexes, 30 year-olds at first visit reported the largest increase among the age groups in proportion of energy coming from protein; those 40 years old at first visit reported the largest decrease in proportion of energy coming from carbohydrates and those 60 years at first visit reported the largest increase in proportion of energy coming from total fat and saturated fat. Perhaps this reflects different sub-cultures and different lifestyles among different age groups in Sweden. More research is needed on factors affecting the different patterns of different age groups.  Surprisingly, no changes over time were visible in the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) for either sex in the northern Swedish population.",a466e9d6-6b9b-4f4d-b81b-4dd18381ec4d
35,discussion8," Also in the German National Nutrition Survey, no changes in Healthy Eating Index were visible over time for either sex [21]. The German researchers speculate that this may reflect simultaneous changes in consumption of healthy and less healthy food groups that may cancel each other out, making such index unsuitable for evaluating longitudinal trends in diet quality. The same likely holds for our results. Also, the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) does not account for level of energy intake. In our data, underreporting of energy intake likely increased at second examination. This may have attenuated an impact of individual increases in intake of food items with pro-inflammatory effects over time. Healthy Diet Score was calculated based on ranks within the group at each time point, meaning that group-level changes over time could not be detected. Importantly, individual improvements in Healthy Diet Score were associated with improved cardio-metabolic profile.",20e368af-cb4b-4444-8612-a280bb74a239
36,discussion9,"  In a previous smaller longitudinal study of weight development among women only in the same Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) population, we have shown that high intake of fruit per se was inversely associated with incident obesity over 10 years [23]. In the present study we did not investigate change in fruit intake as a single predictor of body mass index (BMI). Still, fruit is part of the Healthy Diet Score and, in line with the previous finding [23], we here demonstrate an increased score to be associated with lower body mass index (BMI) at the second visit for both women and men. Other studies relating change in diet exposure to weight outcome yielded results in accordance with ours. Field et al. [24] showed in the Nurses’ Health Study in the US that increases in percentage energy from saturated fat and trans fat were positively associated with weight gain over 8 years and Newby et al.",4d18a0be-d729-45bb-98a7-c9cd522d5653
37,discussion10," [25] showed in a Swedish female cohort that increase in a healthy diet pattern score was inversely associated with weight gain over 9 years. In both studies, the effects were stronger in women with higher baseline body mass index (BMI). On the contrary, Togo et al. [26] did not find any significant association between change in food intake pattern and change in body mass index (BMI) or obesity development in Danish women and men. However, that study may not have fully captured the dietary exposure in that the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was limited to 26 items only. Taken together, the findings from our study and those cited above indicate that a healthy diet supports healthy weight development.",be163108-a92f-4e71-9922-dcbc56a905ce
38,discussion11,"  The present longitudinal study confirms the recent trends of increases in dietary total and saturated fat intake concurrently with increases in serum cholesterol levels (for women) and body mass index (BMI) (for both sexes), which we noted in cross-sectional data from the same population [4]. The significant associations between decreased dietary intake of cholesterol and trans-fatty acids as well as increased Healthy Diet Score and lower serum cholesterol levels and lower body mass index (BMI) warrant attention. Based on our results, a decreased consumption of cholesterol with 10% would be associated with a decrease in serum cholesterol levels with 1.6 mmol/l for women and 1.2 mmol/l for men, and with 3.9 lower body mass index (BMI) units for women and 1.4 lower body mass index (BMI) units for men.  Still, the overall explanatory power of the dietary exposures studied was small and the associations reported must be interpreted with some caution.",df46c95b-f9cc-46a7-a901-503342130f7e
39,discussion12," However, as discussed above the associations are most likely attenuated by random errors and collinearity in the diet exposure variables and therefore in reality somewhat larger. On a population level, dietary changes towards higher accordance with current dietary guidelines would likely have a substantial positive effect on public health. For example, Valsta and co-workers [27] estimated that changes in dietary fat quality and cholesterol intake might explain as much as 65% of the decrease in serum cholesterol levels seen in Finland between 1982 and 2007, illustrating the potential of dietary changes in affecting cardio-metabolic risk factors on a population-level. Further, Björck et al. [28] used the IMPACT model to simulate effects of changes in dietary fat intake on predicted total blood cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease mortality in Sweden between 2010 and 2025.",2b4275ce-f7bc-4ab7-a09b-89b433ea4d5c
40,discussion13," Population-based values for predicted changes in the risk factors smoking, salt intake and physical inactivity were included in the models. Thereafter, two different levels of saturated fat intake were modelled: 10 energy percent representing current Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, or 20 energy percent representing current trends in Sweden of increased intake of saturated fat. The latter scenario predicted in total 400 additional deaths from coronary heart disease in 2025 than did the former scenario.  Further, it is possible that the effects of diet exposure on serum cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure were indeed confounded or mediated through effects on body mass index (BMI). Sensitivity analyses showed that the effects were not confounded by baseline body mass index (BMI), but that change in body mass index (BMI) seemed to, at least partially, mediate the effect of Healthy Diet Score on serum cholesterol, triglycerides and systolic blood pressure in women.",38d20c34-b4d2-43b3-bf4e-f28481d729c4
41,discussion14,"  Few associations were found between reported changes in intake of sucrose and cardio-metabolic risk factors. This is surprising in that high intake of sucrose in randomized controlled trials has been associated with increased levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides as well as higher blood pressure, independent of effects on weight [29]. Similar results also have been found in observational studies [30]. Our result of an association between increased consumption of sugar and lower body mass index (BMI) among women may be a chance finding, since it is not supported by corresponding findings in the literature or by biological explanations. This warrants further investigations.  Conclusion In this large population-based cohort study, group level dietary changes over 10 years towards less carbohydrate and more protein and fat intakes were noted as well as a decrease in trans fatty acids and sucrose consumption.",36304c85-9ecf-4a1d-8d32-00a219c566cf
