0,background0," The shape of the associations between intake of foods basic in a healthy Nordic diet and long-term health is not well known. Therefore, we have examined all-cause mortality in a large, prospective cohort of women in Norway in relation to intake of: Nordic fruits and vegetables, fatty fish, lean fish, wholegrain products, and low-fat dairy products.

1,methods0," A total of 83 669 women who completed a food frequency questionnaire between 1996 and 2004 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2018. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the associations between consumption of the Nordic food groups and all-cause mortality. The Nordic food groups were examined as categorical exposures, and all but wholegrain products also as continuous exposures in restricted cubic spline models.   Study design and setting  The design of the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC)) has been described in detail previously [14]. Briefly put, a random sample of 172 000 women drawn from the Norwegian National Population Registry was enrolled in two waves from 1991 to 2007. Participants completed a mailed, self-administered baseline questionnaire including questions about anthropometric, sociodemographic, dietary, reproductive, and lifestyle factors.",3a958a1d-5f20-4baf-b555-e2a0f96a04de
2,methods1," Follow-up questionnaires were collected over approximately 6-year intervals after recruitment.  The sample for this prospective cohort study included 101 316 women aged 41–76 who completed a food frequency questionnaire (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) during baseline mailing (waves 1996–1997 and 2003–2004; response rates of 57% and 48%, respectively), or during the first follow-up (wave 1991–1992 enrolment did not cover food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data; a response rate of 81%). Women with no follow-up (n = 16) were excluded. We further excluded women with implausible daily energy intake (< 2 500 kJ (n = 1 033) or > 15 000 kJ (n = 141)), and women with missing information on the following variables: body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) (n = 2 272), physical activity (n = 8 548), smoking habits (n = 1 407), and education (n = 4 230), leaving a total number of 83 669 women for the present analysis.",32f7d527-ab31-481e-bd4d-c90697e41715
3,methods2,"  Assessment of Nordic foods intake  Diet was assessed using validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) with approximately 85 frequency items [15–17]. A representative sample of the questionnaires used has previously been published [18]. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was designed to measure the typical diet during the past year with special emphasis on fish consumption. The response options were given with four to seven frequency categories ranging from never/seldom to six or more per week. Portion sizes for some food items were provided as natural (e.g., number of carrots) or household units (e.g., tablespoons).  The Norwegian Weight and Measurement Table with standardised portion sizes and weights was used to convert the consumption of food items to grams [19], and information about the nutrient content in foods was obtained from the Norwegian Food Composition Database [20].",a2bfaac3-a8f3-42c5-a209-a41764d31cbb
4,methods3," The calculations of daily intake of food items, energy and nutrients were made using a statistical syntax in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) developed at the Department of Community Medicine, University of Tromsø, for the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC) cohort. Missing frequency values were treated as no consumption, and missing portion sizes were set to the smallest portion size alternative.  We have considered consumption of five traditional Nordic food groups as exposure of interest, selected to reflect components of a healthy Nordic diet [1, 2]; Nordic fruits and vegetables (apples/pears, broccoli/cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, swede); fatty fish classified as fish with ≥ 4% fat in the meat (salmon, trout, herring, mackerel); lean fish containing < 4% fat in the meat (cod, haddock, plaice) excluding products like fish cakes, fish balls,",9e051d7a-e745-4750-8acf-45cb3efa2735
5,methods4," fish spread and stew; wholegrain products (wholegrain bread and breakfast cereals); low-fat dairy products (skimmed- and semi-skimmed milk, and yoghurt). We analysed lean and fatty fish separately because they are specified in our dietary guidelines as sources of specific essential nutrients such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish, and iodine from lean fish [21]. Each food group was divided into four consumption categories, which were roughly based on serving sizes, dietary advice, or multiples thereof. Cut-off points for each food group are given in the tables where the categorical analyses are presented (Table 2).  Assessment of covariates  The following covariates were included in the analysis: physical activity, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)), smoking status, education, and intake of energy, alcohol and processed red meat.",2c982ba2-a461-46dc-9869-5d125bc69527
6,methods5,"  Physical activity level was included based on validated self-report on a ten-point scale estimating physical activity at home, at work, exercising and walking, and was categorised as low (1–4 points), medium (5–6 points) or high (7–10 points) [22].  body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) was calculated based on self-reported height and weight and has been found to provide valid ranking of body mass index (BMI) in Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC) [23]. body mass index (BMI) was categorised in four categories: < 20, 20–24.9, 25–29.9, ≥ 30 kg/m2.  The smoking variable was computed by combining information on smoking status (never, former, and current), with age at smoking initiation for those who have ever smoked and additionally information of pack years for current smokers who started smoking < 20 years of age.",70712af2-0638-49a3-8246-57565e3cda66
7,methods6," Smoking exposure was then divided into six categories: never smoker, current heavy smoker (smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day since smoking initiation) early starter (age at start smoking < 20), current moderate smoker (smoking less than 20 cigarettes per day since smoking initiation) early starter, current smoker late starter (age at start smoking ≥ 20), former smoker early starter, former smoker late starter.  Education level was based on self-reported years of schooling and was divided into three categories (< 10, 10–12, > 12 years of schooling). Energy intake (kJ per day) was included in the analyses as a continuous variable excluding energy from alcohol. Intake of alcohol was included as a categorical variable as a group of non-consumers and two categories representing low and higher intake (g/day): non-consumers, 0–5, > 5. Intake of processed red meat included meatballs, hamburgers, sausages, and sandwich meats (e.g.",e4586490-88fb-4546-a86d-10a4fefce278

As a common procedure for dietary analyses in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC) study, subcohorts (n = 5) were included in the analyses [18]. Subcohorts were constructed by grouping together the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s that were most similar as some dietary questions have been added to the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) due to new products available on the market, improvements of the questionnaire and specific hypotheses, and which were completed closest together in time, as the data were collected over a period of almost ten years.  Outcome  The women were followed from return of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and until death or censoring, which was the date of emigration or end of follow-up on 31 December 2018.",7f993373-c53e-4ee4-9d43-0d274e026404

Spearman’s rank-order correlation was used to test the associations between the intake of the Nordic food groups. Cox proportional hazards regression models, with age as the underlying time scale, were used to examine the associations between consumption of the five Nordic food groups and all-cause mortality. The proportional hazards assumption was tested with a Schoenfeld residuals test.

13,analysis3," Both models examined the Nordic food groups expressed as categorical exposures, and four of the Nordic food groups were further examined in the multivariable-adjusted model as continuous exposures with restricted cubic splines. The wholegrain products variable could not be examined with restricted cubic splines because it is only based on two food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) frequency questions and the distribution of values could not be approximated to a continuous variable.  The number of knots in the restricted cubic splines was determined by testing and comparing models with three, four and five knots according to the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria to compare how well the different models fit the data. Models with the smallest AIC value were judged to fit the data better, resulting in three knots at fixed percentiles (10, 50, 90) of the distribution [26].",64aa77fe-769a-4f5c-9c8c-c51185d5ad97
14,analysis4," The p-value for non-linearity in the restricted cubic spline analysis was calculated by performing a Wald test of the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the second spline was equal to zero. In all models, subcohorts (n = 5) were included as a stratum variable.  Previous analyses in Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC) have shown associations between dietary patterns and smoking habits [27]. We therefore explored potential interactions between the Nordic food groups and smoking habits, by adding product terms in the mutually adjusted categorical models and performing likelihood-ratio tests to compare model fit between the models with and without these terms. If a statistically significant interaction effect was observed, we performed separate analyses for never and ever smokers.  We performed various sensitivity analyses.",d53ce462-ff67-467e-96af-729bc9f5bacd
15,analysis5," To minimise the chance of reverse causation (by including women who were ill and therefore had changed their food habits) we started follow-up two years after enrolment. As findings for Nordic fruits and vegetables in part could reflect the influence of the consumption of other fruits and vegetables [28], we made further adjustments including other fruits and vegetables in the multivariable-adjusted model. We decided to include body mass index (BMI) as a confounding factor even though body mass index (BMI) may be considered a mediating factor between diet and health outcomes. The reason for this was that the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and reported food intake measured at one time point is difficult to determine, and over- and under-reporting of different food groups has been related to body mass index (BMI) status [29].",b61fc377-dc32-489d-9d3a-6ed78b7f7c9c

26,discussion0," We observed a J-shaped trend between intake of Nordic fruits and vegetables, fatty fish and low-fat dairy products and all-cause mortality, implying that with increasing intake of some traditional Nordic food groups, mortality might change in a non-linear fashion. As the null hypothesis of linearity was not rejected for lean fish, we conclude that the non-linear components did not add more information to those data than a linear model. For wholegrain products, our results were limited to categorical analysis, but a test for trend over categories pointed to a linear association with mortality.  The restricted cubic splines allow for predictions for any value of the variable, compared to only four probabilities in our categorical analyses, or compared to the alternative of modelling a linear relationship. Thus, the estimates from the splines add more information to the results and are therefore emphasized.",0bb692ca-1940-47e6-af89-79ce3ece2786

The maximum benefit of consuming Nordic fruits and vegetables was achieved at around 200 g/day, which is below the recommended intake of all fruits and vegetables of five servings per day [21].",6eaf821b-4add-4d36-8c28-c7dfba3df1d6
28,discussion2," Optimal health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption achieved at a more modest intake level than currently recommended (around three to four servings per day) have also been found in the PURE study [30]. Non-linear inverse associations of fruit and vegetable intake with all-cause mortality have been shown in previous meta-analyses [31, 32], but with dose–response curves that differed from our J-shaped curve for Nordic fruits and vegetables. Aune et al. found that the benefit of increasing fruits and vegetables intake was larger at lower intake levels but observed reductions of risk up to 800 g/day [32], while Wang et al. found that the benefit of fruits and vegetables plateaued at approximately 5–6 servings per day [31].  The benefit of consuming Nordic fruits and vegetable seemed stronger in ever- than in never-smokers.",f0e07650-8c70-4e90-88d2-d443e541ec9a
29,discussion3," Similar tendencies were reported in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which also included a subsample of women from Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC) [33]. In addition, a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies on the association between consumption of fruits and vegetable and risk of lung cancer found stronger associations with lung cancer among smokers. Antioxidant properties of fruits and vegetables are protective against increased oxidative stress caused by smoking [34].  The impact of dairy intake on mortality has been extensively studied, but results are not conclusive [35, 36]. The divergence of results could be due to variation between the different types of dairy products being investigated (i.e., total dairy, specific categories of dairy such as milk, yoghurt, cheese, low-fat/high-fat dairy), different cut-off points between studies, but also the quality of the underlying diet in different populations.",9d0dcc99-aeea-475a-ba20-cd316261084b
30,discussion4," Still, when comparing results on low-fat milk consumption as a specific dairy category and mortality in Nordic populations, one study finds an increased mortality [37] while another found no association [38]. It is noted that the fat content in yoghurt, which was part of the low-fat dairy products in the present study, could be up to 3.4%, and therefore not necessarily considered low-fat. Hence, our results are not directly comparable with these studies. Our analysis showed a non-linear association with low-fat dairy and mortality, much in line with what Ding et al. found for total dairy consumption in three prospective cohort studies in women and men [39].  We observed that consumption up to the recommended 200 g of fatty fish/week (29 g/day) was within a non-significant beneficial range, but when intake reached 60 g/day there was a significantly increased mortality. In contrast, higher consumption of lean fish reduced all-cause mortality.",6d7e9d93-96a3-40d3-afa6-72d10770ebca
31,discussion5," Several large cohort studies have not been able to show any reduced mortality linked to frequent fish consumption [40, 41], but some protective associations are found in metaanlyses [42–44]. Engeset et al. found a non-linear trend with fatty fish consumption and mortality in the European Prospective investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, which included a part of our sample [41]. Also, a study on fish consumption and mortality in a cohort of Swedish men and women found a U-shaped association between consumption of fish and all-cause mortality, which was more pronounced in women [45]. Furthermore, when they considered lean and fatty fish separately, they found no associations between consumption of lean fish and mortality, but up to 68% increased mortality in women who consumed 50 g/day fatty fish compared to the median intake level (9 g/day).",ea9584e7-9639-47a5-8594-850cbf506441
32,discussion6,"  Even though fish is a good source of essential nutrients, it is also a source of environmental contaminants such as dioxins, which are classified as carcinogens, and accumulates in the adipose tissue [21, 46, 47]. While lean fish store fat in the liver, fatty fish store it in the fillet itself, which then contains more of these substances compared to lean fish. One can speculate whether this is related to the observed increased mortality associated with high consumption of fatty fish, but not with lean fish.  The observed protective effect of wholegrain products on all-cause mortality in the present analysis is supported by meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies including populations from the US, Europe, and Asia [48, 49]. In the meta-analysis by Aune et al., reductions in mortality for whole grains were observed up to an intake of 225 g per day and they found a steeper reduction at lower intake levels. In a study on Norwegian wholegrain eaters by Jacobs et al.",d3d80bf9-358c-49ff-857b-1026c278c974
33,discussion7," included in the meta-analyses, they found an inverse association between a calculated wholegrain consumption score and mortality, with the highest score being most beneficial [50]. This score was calculated based on slices of bread multiplied by percentages of wholegrain and was thus based on more detailed information on wholegrain consumption than was available in the present study.  These findings imply that if linear associations between traditional Nordic foods and health outcomes are assumed, it might lead to wrong conclusions as the relationships can be non-linear. Furthermore, they imply that lean and fatty fish might be differently associated to health outcomes, and that this aspect therefore should be investigated further in future studies. Also, the search for optimal intake levels of traditional foods should be emphasised in further studies on regional sustainable diets, both for health and to reduce the burden of food production on the environment.",533f1c07-1315-488c-bb93-95b88ec3418c
34,discussion8,"  Establishing optimal intake levels of foods for health is, however, not straightforward, given the limitations inherent in food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)s to provide precise estimates of actual food intake. Furthermore, analyses on isolated foods does not consider synergistic and antagonistic interactions between food groups existing within the same diet, and possibly also with other lifestyle factors, which might explain why isolated foods sometimes show a seemingly confusing pattern on health. These interactions might be better captured with dietary pattern analyses, but as indicated by our results, careful consideration on how to score individual foods in construction of a combined diet score is warranted.  Strengths and limitations  The strengths of this study include a large sample size, a high number of deaths and the long follow-up (median 20 years), providing enough statistical power in the analysis. Linkage to registry is a strength as all deaths are confirmed.",9eca4032-e35f-4695-86f1-89a3c62884c0
35,discussion9," Furthermore, the risk of sampling bias is considered low due to the selection of women through the National Registry. Another strength is that a validated questionnaire was used to assess food intake and covariates [15–17, 22, 23].  The study is, however, limited by having only one assessment of diet, as dietary habits probably have changed during follow-up. Recalling the habitual diet with the use of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) over the past year could be challenging and give rise to misclassification of dietary exposures, but this is expected to be non-differential. In addition, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was not designed to measure all foods that are part of a healthy Nordic diet and hence does not capture all relevant food components such as wild berries and vegetables like kale or distinguish between specific varieties of Nordic wholegrains such as rye and barley.",a057a521-2d24-44ce-8bd7-0fa57e146933
36,discussion10," Furthermore, precise assessment of dietary exposure is difficult and measurement errors are inevitable in nutritional epidemiology. Also, even though we adjusted for covariates that were unevenly distributed across intake categories of the Nordic food groups, residual confounding due to imprecise assessment of these factors as well as unmeasured factors is likely. The results must be interpreted with caution as the moderate consumers are probably more representative of what most people eat, while both low and high consumers can be different in many ways (e.g., extreme dieters, vegans, people with allergies).  Conclusion  Nordic fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products and fatty fish was non-linearly associated to all-cause mortality, while increased intake of lean fish and wholegrain products reduced all-cause mortality among middle-aged and older women.",dc8b3a94-4195-46f1-893c-15c8c7c00fba
37,discussion11,"  While high consumption of fatty fish increased all-cause mortality, the opposite was found for lean fish, suggesting that they should not be treated as one food group in relation to health outcomes.  Consumption of Nordic fruits and vegetables was most beneficial in women that were either current or former smokers, implying that dietary interventions might be especially important for women with higher risk of premature death due to smoking. Our results indicate that more attention to nonlinear associations is warranted in analyses of diet and health-outcomes.  Supplementary Information  Additional file 1.  Additional file 2.
