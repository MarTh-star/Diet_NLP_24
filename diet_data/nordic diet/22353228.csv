0,introduction0,"Diet has a great impact on the risk and worldwide burden of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases (CVD)), the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes 1, 2. In particular, the effects of dietary fatty acids on the metabolism of serum lipids and lipoproteins and their connection to atherosclerotic process have been thoroughly investigated 3, 4, whereas their effects on low HDL cholesterol 5–8, insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation are still unclear 9, 10. MetS, characterized by insulin resistance, central obesity, clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors and low-grade inflammation, is a major clinical risk indicator of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) globally 1, 2. The Mediterranean diet, representing the diet traditionally eaten in Southern Europe, has long been related to improved health and prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), certain cancers and type 2 diabetes 11–18.",5e06c7b3-16f4-409e-be43-f4d9ad31f2ce
1,introduction1," Acceptance of the Mediterranean diet has not been easy in other parts of the Western world, probably due to difficulties in changing dietary patterns, cultural differences in taste and limited accessibility to various foods 19, 20. A health-enhancing regional Nordic diet has therefore been proposed as an alternative to the Mediterranean diet 21. Recent studies suggest that a healthy Nordic diet pattern is related to lower mortality 22 and improved cardiovascular risk factors in short term 23. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether a Nordic alternative for healthy food pattern in a weight-stable condition would have beneficial effects on insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, serum lipids and lipoproteins, and inflammatory markers in people with MetS.",3084b5a4-b7eb-46c8-a4c2-9041110fa3b4
2,introduction2," The duration of our trial was decided to last for 18–24 weeks to monitor adherence to the diet and analyse the longer-term effects on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and HDL-C metabolism, because there is evidence that short-term results may differ from that achieved in trials with longer duration 24.

3,methods0,"We conducted a randomized dietary study lasting for 18–24 weeks in individuals with features of metabolic syndrome (mean age 55 years, body mass index (BMI) 31.6 kg m−2, 67% women). Altogether 309 individuals were screened, 200 started the intervention after 4-week run-in period, and 96 (proportion of dropouts 7.9%) and 70 individuals (dropouts 27%) completed the study, in the Healthy diet and Control diet groups, respectively. Healthy diet included whole-grain products, berries, fruits and vegetables, rapeseed oil, three fish meals per week and low-fat dairy products. An average Nordic diet served as a Control diet. Compliance was monitored by repeated 4-day food diaries and fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids.  Study design The study was a randomized controlled multicentre study performed in six centres [Kuopio and Oulu (Finland), Lund and Uppsala (Sweden), Aarhus (Denmark) and Reykjavik (Iceland)).",1e13543e-11ab-4c80-bf67-4d1f167c3f28
4,methods1," The primary outcome was insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and secondary outcomes were blood lipids, blood pressure and inflammatory markers as they are all closely related to insulin resistance and are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The study design and the main measurements at each time-points are described in Fig. 1. There was 4-week run-in period during which all participants followed their habitual diet before the participants, fulfilling the inclusion criteria, were randomized into a control (Control diet) group or a Healthy Nordic diet group (Healthy diet) for the next 18–24 weeks. Randomization was performed by matching according to gender and medians of age, body mass index (body mass index (BMI)) and fasting plasma glucose at screening, resulting in equal amounts of certain strata classes amongst the groups. The study participants were planned to visit the study clinic at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks.",2ab714f3-355e-4b4e-b9d9-5a99dddd0a0a
5,methods2," The major visits were in the beginning (0 week) and at 12 and at either 18 or 24 weeks (end of the study). The staff in all study centres were trained to perform the measurements in a similar way, and a common quality management protocol was made familiar to all staff members at each study site. The original protocol was changed after a consultation with the NordForsk Panel and Scientific Committee members after the trial had been started for the following reasons: (i) a shorter period of intervention (i.e. 18 weeks) was considered to give the same information as that obtained from 24 weeks' trial, (ii) total costs would be reduced, and (iii) recruitment of study subjects was easier for a shorter trial. Therefore, it was decided to shorten the intervention to 18 (+/− 1) weeks in four centres (Aarhus, Uppsala, Reykjavik and Oulu), whereas in Lund and Kuopio where the intervention was started earlier, the original study design was followed.",bfe5a94c-5147-414b-97c0-2af670c200c2

The visits to the study centres were in line with the original study plan, and the study was strictly blinded regarding the measurements until the trial was completed in all centres. Thus, in four centres with a shorter intervention (18 weeks), the final measurements according to the original study plan were taken at 18 weeks. The study participants were advised to keep weight and physical activity constant and not to change their smoking and drinking habits or drug treatment during the study.

Nordic nutrition recommendations formed the basis for the Healthy diet 26, and the mean nutrient intake in the Nordic countries formed the basis for the Control diet. The main differences between the diets were the amount of dietary fibre and salt, and the quality of dietary fat. Both the Healthy diet and the Control diet were isocaloric based on the evaluation of the habitual diet (calculated from a 4-day food record) during the run-in period. National nutrient databases were used to calculate energy, macronutrient, cholesterol, fibre and micronutrient contents [Aivo Finland Ltd, Turku, based on the database of the National Institute of Health and Welfare, Finland, Dietist XP Software Package, version 3.1 (2009) linked to Swedish Food Database 2009, Sweden, Master Dietist System version 1.",5af3a1a5-a00b-4fd4-8ea7-86d3ff47e0f2
12,methods9,"235 (2007) based on Danish National Food administration database, Denmark, and The Icelandic Food Composition Database (Icelandic Food Composition Database (ISGEM)), Iceland].  In the Healthy Nordic diet, the main emphasis was on food items such as whole-grain products, abundant use of berries, fruit and vegetables, rapeseed oil, three fish meals per week, low-fat dairy products and avoidance of sugar-sweetened products (Table 1). Key products were provided to the study participants in both groups. The participants in the Healthy Nordic diet group received whole-grain products, for example, various breads, berry products as frozen berries (e.g. strawberries, black currants, bilberries) and dried powder as well as dietary fats including rapeseed oil- and vegetable oil-based spreads. Local fruits (not provided) were mostly apples, pears and plums.

15,methods12," These records were checked at each visit to the study centre, including the visits when the groceries were delivered to the participants, that is, at 1–2-week intervals. In addition to the 4-day food record during the run-in period, the participants kept 4-day food records also at weeks 2, 11 and 17 or 23 before the next visit to the study centre for calculations of the dietary intake during the intervention. All food records included four consecutive days of which one was a weekend day.  Physical activity (total, leisure time, commuting and at work) was monitored by a questionnaire. The aim was to keep physical activity unchanged.  Biochemical and anthropometric measurements Screening laboratory measurements, glucose and lipid values and anthropometric measurements were performed locally according to the standard operational procedures agreed by all centres.",8d26f294-7fa9-4c06-91f8-7b6e6bdf336b
16,methods13," Centralized analyses were as follows: apolipoproteins A1 (Apo A1) and B (Apo B), cytokines and adipokines (University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital), fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids (Uppsala University), 24-h urine sodium and potassium excretion (Copenhagen University) and plasma insulin (Aarhus University Hospital).  A standard 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (75 g d-glucose) was performed after 12-h fast in the morning. Blood samples were taken at the time-points 0, 30 and 120 min to measure the concentrations of glucose and insulin.  Automated clinical chemistry analysers and routine clinical chemistry methods were used to measure glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, Apo A1 and Apo B, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and the liver enzyme activities.",98fb0328-992a-42c2-8fba-bfb3dccf928e

The sample material was either plasma or serum as required by the analytical method in each laboratory. The within-run variations (CV%) for the biochemical measurements were 0.4–4.6%. The between-run CV% was 0.5–6%. LDL-C concentrations were calculated using Friedewald's formula. Plasma insulin was measured using the ELISA method from Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark, with a within-run and between-run CV% <8% and <10%, respectively. Na+ and K+ were measured in 24-h urine samples on a Cobas Fara analyser equipped with ion-selective electrodes (Roche). The CV% for six intrabatch identical samples was <2%.",d1fc2d7e-4d96-4211-b3a3-a7e23e1d7229

There were significant differences between the groups during the intervention in the intakes of carbohydrates, protein, total fat, saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid, fibre, dietary cholesterol, salt and sodium, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, potassium and magnesium, generally favouring the adherence to the Healthy Nordic diet.",80500940-ceec-4bc8-8c06-e7e2e6cf68e3
24,results2," As for the major food items (total fat, saturated fats, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and dietary fibre), the goals of the Healthy diet were satisfactorily achieved (Supplemental Table S1). There was no significant difference between the groups in the reported alcohol intake at baseline, and the changes in alcohol intakes were quite modest during the trial (Table 3). No significant differences were found in the mean values (before and during the intervention) or changes in 24-h sodium and potassium excretion between the groups in the subgroups of individuals with reliable urine collection (N = 84 for Healthy diet group and N = 62 for Control diet group). The figures [mean (SD)] for 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretions (mmol per day) before and during the trial (12-week and 18- to 24-week collections combined) were as follows: 143.5 (51.5) and 141.5 (64.9) for sodium and 66.7 (65.3) and 65.3 (22.5) for potassium in the Healthy diet group and 150.7 (72.",8e3c480f-8817-4cf8-b066-7e13a38ecb7b
25,results6,"076) were different between the groups, the latter reflecting the higher intake of rapeseed oil in the Healthy diet group. Changes in dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid proportions were markedly different (P = 0.00021) with a decrease in the Healthy diet group and an increase in the Control diet group. Proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) and docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) increased in the Healthy diet group and decreased in the Control diet group (between-group difference; P < 0.0001 for both fatty acids).  Body weight, glucose tolerance and liver enzymes There were no significant within-group changes in body weight, and importantly, the groups did not differ with regard to the mean change in body weight during the trial. There were no differences in any of the variables reflecting glucose metabolism or blood pressure at the end of the trial, similarly serum liver enzyme activities did not change significantly during the intervention (Table 4).",49b007a5-a523-4ff8-a1e1-c28529e6ee6f

Figure 3 depicts the changes in LDL-C, HDL-C and Apo B and Apo A1 with time separately for those with 18- and 24-week follow-up.

28,discussion0,"In this randomized trial carried out with isocaloric diets, the Healthy Nordic diet, based on Nordic dietary recommendations, did not modify insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance but resulted in significant between-group changes in non-HDL-C, LDL-C to HDL-C ratio and Apo B to Apo A1 ratio favouring protection from atherosclerosis. Interestingly, as compared to the Healthy diet group, there was a significant increase in IL-1 Ra level with time in the Control diet group. It should be emphasized that our aim was isocaloric study design because we wanted to examine the effect of quality of diet on glucose metabolism, risk factors and inflammation. Concomitant weight loss would make it difficult to interpret the results in this kind of dietary intervention regarding the quality of an experimental diet 13. It can be argued that the results are simply in line to that what can be expected from dietary changes made.",19f56966-2073-4034-8544-c3a004a582ab
29,discussion1," However, besides macronutrient and dietary fibre intakes also micronutrients and non-nutrients may have health effects 12, as was the case in the present study, for example, regarding the link between magnesium intake and the change in IL-1 Ra. Thus, obviously, the present study provides novel data on the health effects of Nordic dietary pattern and adds to our current knowledge on the impact of this diet on multitude of metabolic disorders in individuals with features of MetS, not examined previously in detail.  As judged from the dietary records, compliance to the Healthy diet was satisfactory. With regard to phospholipid fatty acid composition, the decrease in dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid proportions and increase in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) proportions in the Healthy diet group can be ascribed to higher fish intake 32. Instead, there were no significant differences between the groups for oleic acid content.",54cdc6b3-f151-4fbd-ab6c-01982191d861
30,discussion2," It is known from controlled feeding trials, where saturated fat (mainly from high-fat dairy products) have been replaced by rapeseed oil in the diet, that the phospholipid proportions of oleic acid, linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid increase significantly, whereas the proportions of palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and pentadecanoic acid decrease 33.  The lack of effects on glucose metabolism may partly reflect the isocaloric dietary design and that it may be difficult to improve glucose metabolism in established MetS without any concomitant weight loss or more marked changes in diet 23, 29.  The reduction in Apo B to Apo A ratio and non-HDL-C concentration during the healthy Nordic diet indicates the reduction in those lipid fractions that are known to promote atherosclerosis 5, 6.",e07be226-799a-4b64-bded-984f11a785a0
31,discussion3," Whilst the non-HDL-C and Apo B lowering effect of the healthy Nordic diet was expected, the trends towards an elevated HDL-C and Apo A1 were less expected, because lowered HDL-C was reported, for example, in the DASH study 34 and after 6-week intervention in the NORDIET study 23, possibly explained by the lower fat content in those diets. However, a diet rich in berries 35, 36, vegetables, fruit and whole grains and foods with low glycaemic index may result in an elevation of HDL-C in the longer term 24, 37. Indeed, Esposito et al. also reported an elevation in HDL-C by 0.1 mmol L−1 in their study on the long-term effects of a Mediterranean-type diet 14, but there was simultaneous weight reduction during that study 14. According to the present study design, body weight, physical activity and alcohol intake remained essentially unchanged during the trial. Thus, these confounders could not explain the observed results of HDL-C in our study.",36a9da66-2c4a-4ad9-9e62-cdf66ce14c53
32,discussion4," It is noteworthy that not all studies on the Mediterranean-type diet have reported beneficial effects 38.  The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different between the groups. This is in contrast to that seen in the DASH 39 or NORDIET studies 23 with quite similar dietary pattern. In the present study, fat intake was higher as compared to the DASH and NORDIET studies. Furthermore, we achieved only modest changes in self-reported salt intake, and based on 24-h urinary sodium excretion, no reduction in the sodium intake was found in both groups. Perhaps more effort might have been needed in dietary counselling and use of low-salt products.  Amongst the cytokines, IL-1 Ra was markedly and consistently elevated during the Control diet because there was a worsening in the quality of diet. IL-1 Ra is considered as one of the most sensitive markers of inflammation in obesity and MetS 40–44.",a99c0769-8e56-42e9-86fe-0edce710373d
33,discussion5," Furthermore, elevated levels of IL-1 Ra have been shown to predict the onset of type 2 diabetes and progression of MetS to overt type 2 diabetes after adjustment for obesity and hs-CRP 43. The observed elevation of IL-1 Ra may be a compensatory phenomenon 45 to a more atherogenic or proinflammatory composition of the Control diet. Interestingly, IL-1 Ra was associated with the intake of saturated fats (increasing effect) and that of magnesium (decreasing effect), possibly reflecting high intakes of whole-grain products, berries and fruits. Magnesium deficiency may also be directly related to the formation of inflammatory cytokines 46, and in some cohort studies, magnesium intake was inversely associated with systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction 47. In the absence of changed CRP and cytokine levels, decreases in IL-1 Ra and liver fat content were recently observed after a diet rich in polyunsaturated compared with saturated fatty acids 48.",b3790b3f-552a-4047-ab55-07d05c04bcdc
34,discussion6," Furthermore, elevated levels of IL-1 Ra in serum have been related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 49. These earlier findings together with our observations suggest that IL-1 Ra is an interesting and also highly sensitive inflammation marker responsive to dietary changes. All other inflammatory markers, including hs-CRP and IL-6, remained unchanged in the present study. This is in contrast to our previous observations where we found reduction in hs-CRP and E-selectin, a marker of endothelial function, during a diet consisting of fatty fish, rye bread and bilberries, thus resembling the present diet 29. The observed difference between these two studies could be explained by the fact that the amounts of rye bread, fatty fish and bilberries consumed by the study individuals were higher in our previous study, whereas no major changes were otherwise allowed, for example, in the fatty acid composition of the experimental diets29.",7b5b9046-694c-41ba-ab50-014e43cf0e1a
35,discussion7," In the present study, according to the study design, there was an increase in the intake of saturated fat in the Control diet group, whereas the intake of saturated fat was reduced in the Healthy diet group.  Strengths and weaknesses Despite compliance can be considered satisfactory when judging self-reported food records, in this study, the multicentre design including variation in genetic, cultural and dietary aspects could have lowered the chances to observe more pronounced beneficial effects. The larger number of dropouts in the Control diet group could be criticized, but it is explained by the fact that the female study participants were generally aware of healthy dietary principles. Therefore, a number of women randomized into the Control diet group were not willing to continue on the control diet. It can be argued that the variable duration of the study may weaken this study, but this may not be the case as demonstrated in the Fig. 3.",d72ec648-5bdd-48b7-b93f-03238109995b
36,discussion8," One of the strengths of this study is the isocaloric study design achieved for up to 6 months, which made it possible to examine the effects of the dietary composition as such on the outcome measurements of interest without concomitant weight changes taking place in many comparative studies. It should also be noticed that the way we performed statistical analyses (i.e. without any exclusions and adjustments) did not change our conclusions.  From a public health point of view, these results are encouraging, as even small reductions in non-HDL-C and LDL-C are considered to have major impact on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) morbidity and mortality 1, 3, 7. Based on the recent data, non-HDL-C predicts even better the future risk of coronary heart disease than apo B or LDL-C, and the change in non-HDL-C in the present study can be estimated to result in 10% reduction in the coronary heart disease risk 50, 51.",1c086422-cb3c-487d-ae16-3f80e4bf8f1d
37,discussion9," Furthermore, a healthy Nordic dietary pattern may have other health benefit as suggested in a recent cohort study in this field 22.  In summary, this study suggests that it is possible to establish a healthy Nordic diet based on the Nordic dietary recommendations and using Nordic and local food items. Although no effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism was detected, possibly due to the weight-stable conditions, this diet corrected non-HDL-C and LDL-C to HDL-C and corresponding apolipoprotein ratios. A counteracting effect on the inflammation marker IL-1 Ra by the healthy Nordic diet vs. Control diet is an interesting new finding.
