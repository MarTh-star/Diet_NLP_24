0,methods0," Protocol of this review was registered and is available in PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2020CRD42020181924). Eligible studies included original research papers with the following components: 1. Lingonberry or bilberry treatment (fermented or not fermented whole berry or berry juice, whole berry extracts, anthocyanin-rich extracts, and other fractions of extracts derived from bilberry or lingonberry); 2. digestive tract human cancer cell line, animal model, or human patients; 3. treatment tested on a direct cancer-relevant endpoint, including the number and size of tumors or pre-cancerous lesions, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, or invasion and migration of tumor cells.  Publications not written in English, case-reports, reviews, and conference abstracts were excluded.",32ad0f9d-7df5-45f3-bbdc-b6ebeda65e04
1,methods1," Studies with only indirect markers of cancer risk, such as oxidative stress or inflammation, or studies with single compounds not derived from lingonberry or bilberry, were considered outside the scope of this review.  The literature search was carried out by 2 independent reviewers (TO and AK) on 20.4.2020 and updated on 4.3.2021 in four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CAB abstracts.

3,methods3," Full texts were retrieved for included studies and for papers that did not provide all relevant information in the abstract. A final selection was made in duplicate based on the full text.  Data from each included study was extracted by 2 independent reviewers (TO and AK/MM) using a piloted form. Each study was extracted in duplicate. Disagreements were solved with the 3rd reviewer (AK/MM). Data collected from each study included publication information, authors, cell line/animal model/human population and site of cancer, berry species, berry preparation used for exposure, time of exposure, concentration, end points studied, methods used, controls, number of repeats and replicates (cell studies) or number of studied individuals (animals or human subjects), results, conclusions made by authors, reviewers’ evaluation of study quality, and other comments. Due to variable methodology across studies, collected data was considered suitable for qualitative synthesis only.",e842278e-5a9a-42be-bc49-6dc94788270f
4,methods4," Data was tabulated by cancer type (colorectal or oral cancer) and study type (human study, animal study, or in vitro study).  3. Results  The selection process of the systematic search and numbers of included and excluded papers are presented in Figure 1. In total, 43 full text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 17 [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33] were excluded based on reasons given in Figure 1. At the end of the selection process, 26 articles were considered eligible for this review. Of these studies, a great majority (25/26) investigated colorectal cancer (colorectal cancer (CRC)); only one cell culture study related to oral cancer was identified, and no publications on other digestive tract cancers with a lingonberry or bilberry treatment were found. Anticancer effects of bilberry preparations on colorectal cancer (CRC) were studied in one human clinical study, 7 animal studies, and 13 cell culture studies.",dbabbc99-cde4-4aa3-bfd4-1cf62776a145
5,methods5," Lingonberry treatment was tested on colorectal cancer (CRC) models in one animal study and 8 cell culture studies. Study characteristics and main results from animal studies related to colorectal cancer (CRC) are presented in Table 1 and from cell culture studies in Table 2.  3.1. Human Study on Colorectal Cancer  To our knowledge, only one clinical pilot human study on bilberry or lingonberry and any digestive tract cancer has been published to date. Thomasset et al. treated colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with standardized bilberry anthocyanin rich extract, Mirtocyan (Indena S.p.A., Milan, Italy), for seven days before scheduled resection of primary tumor or liver metastasis [10]. Patients were randomized into three groups based on dosage (1.4/2.8/5.6 g/day), but no control group was included. Cellular proliferation and apoptotic index in the tumor tissue were compared to pre-intervention values.",127b6439-cb26-427c-97c8-28eda1a8a4e5
6,methods6," After the one-week treatment, tumor cellular proliferation decreased by 7% and apoptotic index increased from 3.6% to 5.3% in all groups combined.  3.2. Animal Studies on Colorectal Cancer  Animal experiments on colorectal cancer (CRC) are presented in Table 1. Animal models used were genetic ApcMin/+ mouse model [9,34,35], toxin-induced carcinogenesis in a rat or mouse [34,35], and a xenograft mouse model with subcutaneously inoculated human adenocarcinoma cells [36,37]. Treatments included freeze-dried lingonberry and bilberry [38], as well as anthocyanin-rich bilberry extracts [9,34,35,36,37,39]. All these treatments reduced number and/or size of intestinal tumors or pre-malignant lesions. However, bilberry extract alone did not have an effect on subcutaneous tumors in the mouse xenograft, but reduced tumor volume when given in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug [36,37].  antioxidants-10-00850-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Colorectal cancer: Main results of animal studies.",00bdf06b-7402-4edd-a350-bcd838e34e34

11,methods11," Enhanced tumor immune filtration was associated with improvement of tumor control.	 Animal model type used: (a) induced carcinogenesis, (b) genetic model, and (c) xenograft.  In the rat model of toxin-induced carcinogenesis, bilberry anthocyanin rich extract supplementation significantly reduced the number of total and large colonic aberrant crypt foci (aberrant crypt foci (ACF)) after 14 weeks of treatment [34]. Proliferation of colonic cells reduced by nearly 50% and rats fed with this extract had reduced expression of COX-2 mRNA, together with a reduced number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF). In a corresponding mouse model study, bilberry anthocyanin rich extract supplementation for 10 weeks significantly reduced the size and number of colon tumors [35]. Interestingly, animals fed with 10% of this extract had almost no detectable tumors at the end of the trial.",b77a5a37-4594-402c-9f04-7a3bfc9115dd
12,methods12," Reduction in colon length was measured as an indicator of inflammation and was attenuated together with tumor formation and growth by bilberry treatment.  Bilberry anthocyanin rich extract was effective also in the genetic ApcMin/+ mouse model, reducing dose-dependently the number of small intestinal adenomas [9]. In another study using this mouse model, freeze dried bilberry reduced only the number, but interestingly not the size of adenomas [38]. Similarly, the number of tumors was reduced by bilberry anthocyanins in ApcMin/+ mice treated with antibiotics and subsequently infected with enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, but tumor size was not reported in this study [39]. Freeze dried lingonberry, however, reduced both the number and size of intestinal adenomas [38]. This was the only animal study conducted with a lingonberry treatment and the only study with a whole-berry preparation instead of an anthocyanin rich extract.",df156cfc-2f3f-4931-9a0d-49438a2adc12
13,methods13,"  In the two studies on a mouse xenograft with subcutaneous colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors, bilberry anthocyanin rich extract alone did not affect tumor volume but enhanced the effectivity of an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug in combination therapy [36,37]. Enhancement of tumor control was associated with tumor immune filtration in the study of Liu et al., and was abolished with antibiotic treatment in Wang et al. publication, suggesting a role for modulation of gut microbiota and/or immune responses by bilberry anthocyanin rich extract [36,37].  In these reviewed animal studies, formation and growth of intestinal tumors or pre-cancerous lesions was inhibited with 10% (w/w) of freeze-bilberry or lingonberry in diet [38], from a few grams/kg to 10% (w/w) of bilberry anthocyanin extract in diet [9,35], and with 3.85 g of bilberry anthocyanin rich extract/kg in diet [34]. When administered separately, 8.",110fd63d-4f7f-42a6-8c32-87a92d8abe6a
14,methods14,"6 mg/kg of bilberry anthocyanin extract 3 times per week reduced tumor number by approximately 50% compared to the control [39]. In the studies on xenograft models, 156 µg/day per mouse and 25 mg/kg body weight daily of bilberry anthocyanin extract were sufficient for enhancing a therapeutic effect of an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug [36,37].  3.3. In Vitro Studies on Colorectal Cancer  Studies on colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines are presented in Table 2. A total of 10 studies with a bilberry treatment, 5 with a lingonberry treatment, and 3 with both were identified. In these studies, berry extracts were found to reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51] and induce apoptosis [44,49,52]. Furthermore, tumor cells were more sensitive than non-tumorigenic cells to the anti-proliferative effects of investigated berry extracts [39,43].  antioxidants-10-00850-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Colorectal cancer: Main results of in vitro studies.",58af3ceb-1835-4cae-9649-30b357ea914a

Similarly, various lingonberry extracts inhibited proliferation in all studies which tested lingonberry extracts on colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation [40,41,42,44,46].",60f83b3a-ac6d-4b9c-8aa5-c898bacd18c5
24,methods24," Within individual studies, higher concentrations of various berry extracts and longer exposure times generally led to higher inhibition of tumor cells, but similar consistency could not be seen when results of all studies were compared, possibly due to different chemical compositions of tested extracts. Only two studies compared inhibition of tumor cells to that of non-tumorigenic digestive tract cells, both indicating greater sensitivity of tumor cells [39,43]. Zhao et al. (2004) found that tumor cells responded to bilberry extract at lower concentrations (25µg of monomeric anthocyanin/mL) and at earlier timepoints (48 and 72 h) compared to non-tumorigenic cells, with significant growth inhibition of 24% and 53%, respectively [43]. Time-dependent inhibition was observed with higher concentrations (50 and 75 of monomeric anthocyanin/mL), whereas non-tumorigenic immortalized NCM460 cells were significantly inhibited only after 72 h with all concentrations.",83cce2ae-233b-4247-8159-11ac0ee9e47a
25,methods25," Similarly, in the study of Mudd et al. (2020), non-tumorigenic colon cells were less sensitive than tumor cells to bilberry anthocyanins, with IC50 values of 124 and 75 µmol/mL for tumorigenic HT-29 and HCT116, respectively, and 1050 µmol/mL for non-tumorigenic NCM460 cells [39].  Some in vitro studies reported cytotoxicity or cell viability instead of inhibition of proliferation, with inconsistent results [47,52,53,54,56]. Mild toxicity was reached with 400 ug/mL of bilberry juice on Caco-2 [56] and with 500 ug/mL of bilberry pomace extract on HT-29 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells [52]. Bilberry decoction and infusion teas were cytotoxic to LS147 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with approximately 180 ug/mL EC50 values [54]. However, no toxicity was detected for 4 mg/mL of bilberry extract on HCT116 [41], or for in vitro digested or fermented lingonberry extracts on HT-29 or HT115 with concentrations below 50 ug/mL [53].",aa1924e8-2a51-4f07-b931-6a453728ca10
26,methods26," On the other hand, bilberry reduced toxicity of topoisomerase poisons in the study of Esselen et al., raising the possibility of counteracting therapeutic toxicity of chemotherapy [47].  Induction of apoptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was also investigated [41,44,49,52]. Bilberry extracts induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells with concentrations above 20 mg/mL [44,49] but not in HCT116 with a concentration of 4 mg/mL [41]. Proanthocyanin-rich extracts of both lingonberry and bilberry induced apoptosis in SW820 and SW640 cells with much lower concentrations; EC50s for both extracts were below 25 ug/mL [55]. Apoptosis was further investigated in this study with bilberry proanthocyanidin extract and was found to be induced via the extrinsic pathway.  3.4. Oral Cancer  No eligible in vivo studies on lingonberry or bilberry and oral cancer were found, but one eligible study on oral carcinoma cells was identified (Table 3).

27,methods27," (2018) found that lingonberry juice fermented using Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibited the proliferation of oral tongue cancer cell lines HSC-3 and SCC25 [57]. Fermented juice also inhibited the invasion of HSC-3, and similarly but not significantly that of SCC25. Migration, however, was not inhibited in either cell line.  4. Discussion  The aim of this work was to systematically review all in vitro and in vivo English written research publications related to the anticancer effects of lingonberry and bilberry on digestive tract cancers. Published data was mainly focused on bilberry and colorectal cancer (CRC), and these studies suggest antiproliferative and anti-tumor effect for various bilberry preparations.",6f74b8ce-4eb6-4209-aada-887b9b393ca5
28,methods28," Only one uncontrolled pilot human trial was identified, in which bilberry anthocyanin-rich extract supplement modestly reduced cancer cells proliferation and increased apoptosis compared to pre-intervention values in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue after treatment as short as 7 days [10]. Lingonberry preparations showed inhibitory effects comparable to bilberry in cell culture models (Table 2), and freeze-dried lingonberry inhibited adenoma growth even more than bilberry in the only animal experiment conducted on lingonberry [38]. Fermented lingonberry juice inhibited the proliferation of oral carcinoma cells in vitro [57]. Taken together, evidence from human trials is still needed, but all data to date from in vitro and animal models support the antiproliferative and tumor-inhibitory effects of various bilberry and lingonberry preparations on digestive tract cancers.",3995e9f4-af9d-4d97-a1e3-0905097e147f
29,methods29,"  In vitro, various bilberry extracts, even at low concentrations (GI50 values 25 µg/mL–5 mg/mL) inhibited proliferation [39,41,43,44,45,47,50,51], and at higher concentrations (above 20 mg/mL) induced apoptosis [41,44,49] in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. However, proanthocyanidin-rich extracts of bilberry and lingonberry induced apoptosis already at far lower concentrations, at the levels of micrograms/mL [55]. In vivo, the proliferation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells reduced by nearly 50 % in rats with induced carcinogenesis, treated with bilberry anthocyanin rich extract [34]. Small decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptotic index were also detected in tumor tissue of bilberry-treated colorectal cancer (CRC) patients [10]. The specific mechanism behind the antiproliferative activity remains to be specified. Cell growth seems to be inhibited in a cytostatic manner in cell culture [41,43,44,57], but apoptosis may be induced after reaching a concentration threshold [44].",4646dbac-3c09-49b1-bf37-7adb70a284e7
30,methods30," One animal study found that a reduction in colonic cell proliferation in bilberry-treated rats was associated with reduced expression of COX-2, suggesting a link with anti-inflammatory activity [34].  In the animal studies, bilberry extracts inhibited the formation of induced and genetic murine intestinal malignant tumors, or pre-malignant transformations [9,34,35,38,39]. Interestingly, bilberry did not reduce the size of small-intestinal adenomas in contrast to lingonberry [38]. In a later publication of this experiment, superior effect of cloudberry compared to bilberry on adenoma size was found to be associated with downregulated gene expression of energy metabolism-related genes and a smaller ratio of intraepithelial to all mucosal CD3+ T lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa [33]. Bilberry did not affect the formation of subcutaneous tumors in a xenograft mouse model [36,37].",b167d3ff-b015-4ebb-aa7c-9861041655d2
31,methods31," However, the bilberry extract enhanced the effectivity of an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug against subcutaneous tumors [36,37]. It is of note that tumors outside the digestive tract would likely be exposed to lower concentrations of berry phytochemicals and their metabolites than tumors in the digestive tract.  The studies we analyzed did not give an exact mechanistical explanation for antitumor activity of lingonberry or bilberry. In the one human pilot study, both cellular proliferation and apoptotic index in the tumor tissue were affected by bilberry extract supplementation [10]. According to the animal studies reviewed here, the anticancer effect of these berries is suggested to come across, at least in part, via modulation of gut microbiota and/or immune responses [33,35,36,37,39]. These effects could, to some extent, also impact tumorigenesis outside the digestive tract [36,37].",d7b88b38-663f-47d2-b886-7b69c408909a
32,methods32," In addition to local effects, systemic effects could be reached via fluctuating postprandial pulses of phytochemicals, slow release of absorbable metabolites in the digestive tract, and accumulation to tissues during prolonged exposure. Besides inhibiting the growth of tumors, berry extracts may inhibit tumor initiation through their DNA-protecting abilities [11,53], supported by the lower number of tumors or pre-cancerous transformations in animals treated with lingonberry and bilberry extracts [9,34,35,38,39].  Anthocyanin-rich extracts are the most frequently examined berry extracts in digestive tract cancers. However, based on our reviewed articles, the anticancer effect of some other berry phytochemicals could be even stronger than that of anthocyanins [40,42,46], or the activity may be synergistic between different compounds.",f19a47c6-9083-4ede-a82d-280a4e617516
33,methods33," Interestingly, freeze-dried lingonberry reduced adenoma growth in the ApcMin/+ mouse model more than bilberry [38] regardless of the lower anthocyanin content in lingonberry. Additionally, both lingonberry and bilberry extracts inhibited colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation in vitro [41,44] regardless of their differing phytochemical profiles [16]. In fact, the anthocyanin-rich fraction of lingonberry extract was less antiproliferative than the whole lingonberry extract [32,33], or fractions rich in proanthocyanins [33,34]. In addition, bilberry flavonol fraction and phenolic acid fraction both inhibited proliferation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, suggesting that antiproliferative activities are shared by different phenolic compounds [51].",a7b8debb-8118-455f-8b2b-dd8d323b8945
34,methods34,"  The relevance of in vitro studies with berry extracts is debatable, since berry phytochemicals are extensively modified in the digestive tract, and preparations used in cell culture differ in their chemical composure from the metabolites formed during digestion. Therefore, in vitro studies with original berry extracts may have relevance in oral cavity cancers, but not necessarily in lower digestive tract neoplasia. Yet, based on effectivity shown in vivo (Table 1), and the potency of different extracts in vitro (Table 2 and Table 3), anticancer effects on digestive tract cancers may not require high systemic bioavailability of certain original berry phytochemicals. Some biological activity seems to persist even after extensive modification by human and microbial enzymes [53,57]; however, more research on this subject is needed.",30cf8482-46d5-4b07-8425-4864b880b3d9
35,methods35,"  The possible anticancer effects of lingonberry and bilberry are numerous, but exact mechanisms and effective constituents are still unclear and yet to be investigated in cancer prevention and treatment. Regardless of encouraging results from several in vitro and animal studies on bilberry and colorectal cancer (CRC), only one pilot human trial has been conducted. Deeper understanding of the effective lingonberry and bilberry components, their metabolites, synergy, and underlying biological mechanisms is needed to pave the way for human trials. Animal models have shown the potential of lingonberry and bilberry to inhibit colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis, but effective dose for humans cannot be deduced based on animal studies. Proving preventive potential in human trials would require multicenter studies with large populations and long follow-ups.",6235ad34-b3e2-44c8-adb5-9c83474c9331
36,methods36," Elaborating the anticancer mechanisms of phytochemicals could reveal previously unseen or overlooked aspects of carcinogenesis, and help not only to improve cancer treatment, but also to assess and minimize the cancer risk of an individual. Possible therapeutic benefits of berry phytochemicals [36,37] and potential undesired interactions [47] in combination treatments should also be carefully investigated in future trials.  Due to varying methodology in reviewed studies, meta-analysis could not be conducted. Reporting of experimental replicates and repeats was unclear in some in vitro studies, and the statistical significance of the inhibition of cellular proliferation not always tested, but we did not exclude any controlled studies based on reporting quality. In contrast to our original inclusion criteria, one uncontrolled human pilot study was included, based on the lack of controlled human studies.",5b628cfa-b924-4322-a700-2b2f384e57a0
37,methods37," It should also be noted that many berries have shown anticancer activities [11], but here we went through only research conducted on lingonberry and bilberry, not entirely covering the research field of anticancer effects of wild berries.  5. Conclusions  Based on the literature found, bilberry inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in experimental models, but this effect has not yet been investigated in any placebo controlled human trials. Data also suggested similar activity for lingonberry on colorectal cancer (CRC) and oral cancer cell lines. In addition to anthocyanins, various other berry phytochemicals may have similar and synergistic inhibitory effects on tumor processes. The identification of active berry components, exact local and systemic mechanisms of action, and effective doses require further investigation. ",7130e0fe-1808-446f-bea5-6c39547ba33d
