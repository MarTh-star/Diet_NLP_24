0,background0,"In the last years, the Nordic diet has emerged as a healthy regional eating option [1]. The Nordic diet tries to reflect the diet consumed in Nordic countries, particularly its healthier choices, including the intake of apples, pears and berries, root and cruciferous vegetables as well as cabbages, whole grain and rye bread as cereals, high intake of fish, low-fat dairy products, potatoes and vegetable fats, among others [1, 2]. To our knowledge, the long-term effects of the Nordic diet on major chronic diseases have only been investigated in prospective cohorts within Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, and Finland) [3–10] and the observed effects remain inconsistent.  Another regional diet, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), has been extensively evaluated in relation to chronic diseases. The MedDiet refers to the dietary habits in countries around the Mediterranean basin, based on the rural models.",434665a6-15d9-4677-8b80-b028ae00dcf8
1,background1," This diet postulates a high intake of fruits, nuts and seeds, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, low intake of meat and dairy products, moderate intake of alcohol, mainly from red wine, and extra virgin olive oil as a major fat source [11]. A large multicenter trial conducted in Spain, the PREDIMED (Prevención con dieta mediterránea) study, proved beneficial health effects of the MedDiet, primarily in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD)) [12], and similar effects have also been observed in prospective studies [13, 14]. The PREDIMED study also showed a reduction of the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) [15] and a reduction of incident breast cancer [16]. For T2D, this association was also confirmed in large prospective studies and meta-analyses [17–19]. Further, some beneficial effects have been also shown for certain types of cancer [20].",034f80bc-eff5-4e91-91b1-1bc00f453ae0
2,background2,"  However, there is some controversy on the possible beneficial effects of the MedDiet outside of the Mediterranean region [21]. As stated by Hoffman and Gerber [21], certain factors, such as food availability, composition of foods available in the Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries, and culinary traditions, could complicate following a MedDiet. Similarly, the same could be stated for the application of the Nordic diet in a non-Nordic area. The European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam) cohort presents a suitable frame for the evaluation of the possible beneficial effects of these two regional diets on the onset of major chronic diseases in both non-Mediterranean and non-Nordic populations.",6873e5c8-2f18-4afe-b581-970913eb34ec

Briefly, it includes 27,548 men and women, aged mainly 35–65 years, recruited between 1994 and 1998. Participants were selected from the general population of Potsdam and surroundings and were invited to a baseline examination conducted by trained staff. At baseline, computer-guided interviews on lifestyle and medical history were also conducted. Every 2–3 years, participants received via mail a follow-up questionnaire in order to assess incident disease cases. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Federal State of Brandenburg and written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the time of recruitment [22, 23].",18e913ad-c4c2-43a1-9806-90b2d846e49c

Finally, the analytical dataset included 9128 men and 14,357 women (n = 23,485). For the analysis on incident T2D, cases of other types of diabetes were excluded as well as those without verified T2D (final sample n = 23,411). In the case of the analysis for MI, stroke, and cancer, participants with non-verified positive self-reports were excluded, resulting in analytical samples of 23,409 for MI, 23,277 for stroke, and 23,152 for cancer.  Dietary assessment and diet scores Habitual dietary intake was assessed at baseline by self-administered semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaires (food frequency questionnaires (FFQ)).",2b7c7f55-3549-43c3-9255-a8a6834bf2d2
6,methods2," This consisted of 148 food items and inquired after the frequency of intake and portion sizes during the last 12 months. Questions about the fat content of the dairy products consumed as well as about the types of fats used for preparation and cooking were included. The reproducibility and validity of the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) have been previously reported [24, 25]. Briefly, a total of 104 men and women, aged 35–64 years, completed 12 monthly 24-h dietary recalls, and these were used as a reference method for the estimation of the relative validity of the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). Spearman correlations between food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and the mean intake of the 24-h dietary recalls were calculated, ranging from 0.14 for legumes to 0.90 for alcoholic beverages. For bread, the correlation was 0.51, 0.42 for cereals, 0.50 for fruits, 0.34 for vegetables, 0.37 for potatoes, 0.18 for nuts and seeds, 0.56 for milk and milk products, 0.21 for fish, 0.",3465974a-4418-48f7-a518-91caa6336838

For cereals, the calculated correlation was 0.73, 0.61 for fruits, 0.54 for vegetables, 0.70 for legumes, 0.71 for potatoes, 0.66 for nuts and seeds, 0.55 for milk and milk products, 0.77 for fish and for meat, and 0.73 for processed meat [24].  The construction of the Nordic diet score was based on previous publications [1, 5, 26–29], as well as on the data available in the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). We created a score ranging from 0 to 18 points, incorporating 9 components (Table 1). After categorizing each food component into sex-specific tertiles of intake, the participants received a score of 0 to 2 points according to the first, second, and third tertile, respectively.",88824c4b-16c7-49b1-99bd-b9ecc277d493

This scoring was inverted for meat and dairy products. Alcohol intake was considered optimal if consumed in moderation (2 points for consumption of 5–25 g/d for women and 10–50 g/d for men, 0 otherwise). In the case of olive oil, the scoring was adapted for the intake in non-Mediterranean countries as follows: 0 points were assigned to non-consumers and sex-specific medians were calculated within olive oil consumers. Two points were assigned to those with consumption over the median and 1 point to those below [17, 31].Table 2 Components and food items considered in the score created to evaluate adherence to the Mediterranean diet score (tMDS) based on that established by Trichopoulou et al.",e18d04bb-0e26-43ae-a063-b76672ef2594

The Swedish Women’s Lifestyle and Health cohort included more than 44,000 women followed for over a median of 20 years [10]; however, no association between the Nordic diet and the risk of breast and colorectal cancer or cardiovascular disease (CVD) was observed [7, 9, 33]. In addition, in two Finnish prospective cohorts, the Helsinki Birth Cohort and the Health 2000 survey, no association between the Nordic diet and the risk of T2D was detected [4].

However, it would be too ambitious to hypothesize that this small disparity could lead to the different observations. The Helsinki Birth Cohort and the Health 2000 survey indicated no association between the Nordic diet and the risk of T2D, considering six components in line with the Nordic diet pyramid [4] (berries/apples/pears, vegetables, rye/oats/barley, fat-free milk/< 2% fat milk, salmon/freshwater fish, and polyunsaturated fatty acids/(saturated fatty acids + trans-fatty acids) ratio), two components that contradict these (meat products and total fat (E%)), and alcohol, which should be consumed in moderation.",2be47a7b-5594-441e-9304-2edac156d6cf

Indeed, previous publications in the same cohorts already showed an inverse association of the Nordic diet with abdominal obesity [34] and low-grade inflammation [35]. Other items considered as part of the Nordic diet in other publications, like potatoes, low-fat dairy products and vegetable oils, were also included in our score [26, 36]. These discrepancies highlight the necessity to get into an agreement about the definition of Nordic diet.  Regarding the MedDiet, beneficial effects on the incidence of T2D have already been reported in a large randomized control trial, the PREDIMED study [15], as well as in large longitudinal cohorts, and summarized in several meta-analyses [17–19]. Moreover, we have shown that alcohol presented the highest contribution to the observed beneficial effect of both MedDiet scores.",cc546fb3-2be6-4e4c-9285-85e7cc61872f
32,discussion4," This observation is in line with European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct study, which also observed that high olive oil and low meat consumption, besides moderate alcohol consumption, are important components of the effect of the MedDiet on T2D. In line with these observations, a meta-analysis concluded that olive oil could have beneficial effects on the prevention and management of T2D [37]. Finally, another meta-analysis also determined that the intake of red and processed meat increased the risk. In our study, we also showed a marginal effect of these two components [38]. The association between MedDiet and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been extensively explored [12–14, 39]. In our analysis, we observed a tendency of adherence to the MedPyr to lower the risk for incident MI, with a stronger effect in women than in men. Similarly to T2D, this association appeared to be at least in part attributable to alcohol intake.",16dc10d4-5dcc-4ba7-b2e0-8325cc8bab8a
33,discussion5," The protective effects of alcohol intake on cardiovascular risk have been a matter of substantial debate. A recent meta-analysis supported the idea that the health effects of alcohol intake depend on the amount as well as on the pattern of consumption [40]. Nevertheless, a recent study from Bell et al. [41] found heterogeneous associations for the level of alcohol consumption and different cardiovascular endpoints, encouraging for a more accurate and careful research and public health counseling.  In our study, we observed sex differences in the association of the a priori defined scores with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous studies have already discussed the sex differences in response to diet, particularly fat-rich diets [42–44]. Grosso et al. [13] summarized prospective studies in a meta-analysis and observed an inverse association between adherence to the MedDiet and the occurrence of stroke.",50e5bcd1-747a-4215-b91c-f10466c3c06e
34,discussion6," Recently, a work evaluated the associations of four different MedDiet scores with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk prospective cohort [14]. An inverse association was observed for stroke with the MedPyr score but not for the three other scores assessed. The construction of the dietary scores (items included and cut-offs used) may directly affect the results. This is one of the major critic points and has been extensively discussed before [21, 45–47]. In this study, we decided to use one of the most frequently applied scores to represent the MedDiet in non-Mediterranean areas, the tMDS. For the calculation of this score, we used population-specific cut-off values for most component food groups, thus assigning score points based on relative ranking in the cohort rather than absolute food consumption levels.",2465910f-c28d-434d-9480-b3853b800ce3
35,discussion7," Another study conducted in the European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort evaluating the effects of the MedDiet on heart failure [48] suggested the use of observed medians in the European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-Greece cohort [30], arguing that, by using these, the calculated score better represents food consumption levels of the ‘true’ MedDiet. Apart from this, and following the suggestion from Tong et al. [14], we also used the MedPyr score, which is based on the Mediterranean pyramid proposed by the Mediterranean Diet Foundation [11]. This score has two major differences in comparison to the tMDS. First, the pyramid includes more food groups (15) – separating fruits and nuts, distinguishing between red, processed and white meat, and additionally including potatoes, eggs, and sweets. Second, score points are assigned to absolute food consumption levels rather than relative intake.",ff0e8d32-4abc-47b9-8afc-9a77fadfbf05
36,discussion8," For those food items included in both scores, the MedPyr score reflected somewhat smaller differences in absolute intake between those considered to have a high versus low score compared to tMDS (Additional file 1: Table S1). Both differences in the definition of components and in their intake levels are possible explanations for inconsistent associations observed for both scores in our cohort. The study of Tong et al. [14], in line with our observations, also showed the strongest associations with cardiovascular outcomes for the MedPyr score. However, they also conclude that the three scores used to assess adherence to the MedDiet (the MedPyr, the tMDs, and a third one based on the literature as proposed by Sofi et al. [49]) were useful in epidemiological settings [14]. Unfortunately, thus far, there are no data available regarding the utility and the use of different Nordic diet scores.",2dbb2d5d-b975-435c-b0a4-9ef4a09f089e
37,discussion9," On the other hand, for a better comparability among the created scores and with other previous publications, we decided to construct scores without adjusting components for total energy intake. We included total energy intake as a covariate in the regression models in order to achieve the equivalent of an isocaloric diet. This is in accordance with the methodology applied by Trichopoulou et al. [30, 50] when they first created and evaluated the MedDiet score and its implication on health. Still, the role of energy adjustment of components prior to dietary pattern score calculation remains a matter of scientific debate. First, heterogeneity exists across previous studies as to whether and what kind of energy adjustments were applied, which limits the comparability between studies. Secondly, few studies have been performed to evaluate the consequences of such methodological differences.",f6121186-c40f-41cf-b5b0-976e29e7e03d
38,discussion10," For example, studies have found little difference in derived patterns if input variables were or not adjusted for energy. Additionally, expressing the input variables as contributions to energy intake might be less meaningful for food groups that might be important for health but contribute little to energy intake [51].  Some strengths and limitations of the present work should be mentioned. The European prospective investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study is a large follow-up study that includes a high number of apparently healthy participants at baseline. Together with the medical verification of the new incident cases, the validity of our observations was strengthened. On the other hand, the use of a food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) as a tool for measuring habitual dietary intake is not exempt from limitations and there is much discussion on how well the food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) captures habitual diet [52, 53].",f080a504-c0ba-49c4-9182-276d66712cf5
39,discussion11," For example, misreporting is a common problem, which could lead to measurement error and bias in the estimations. Moreover, diet and other lifestyle factors were only assessed at baseline, and possible changes have not been taken into account. Possible diet changes after the diagnosis of a chronic disease could have led to reverse causality and thus explain our observations. However, after the exclusion of prevalent cases of chronic disease and the further sensitivity analysis excluding incident cases within the first 2 years, we made an attempt to minimize this problem. We have also controlled our analysis for a large number of plausible confounders that could influence the association between the dietary patterns and risk of chronic diseases. Nevertheless, residual confounding is possible due to imperfect measurement or presence of unknown confounders. Due to possible limited power, we decided to combine overall cancer incidence as an outcome.",d3d17416-139a-4d97-b547-5c082d0eeadc
40,discussion12," However, this approach might complicate possible conclusions and interpretations of the null finding and, still, possible beneficial effects on specific cancer sites cannot be ruled out. The same problem on limited power could also apply to incident stroke and MI.  Conclusions In summary, we have observed an inverse association of both MedDiet scores with the incidence of T2D, with alcohol being a relevant component within these. At the same time, we have observed that the MedPyr score was also associated with lower risk of MI in women, but not in men. However, we have not observed any other statistically significant association between the evaluated scores and the risk of stroke or overall cancer. Nevertheless, possible beneficial effects cannot be completely ruled out due to limited power to evaluate associations and the possibility of cancer site-specific effects.",799d4dd1-3dde-4d43-9caa-fac9902be668
