A self-administered study questionnaire; nutrition questionnaire; and a HRQoL questionnaire, Research and Development 36-Item Health Survey (RAND-36) (11), along with information sheet and consent form, were sent home to the subjects and later collected and checked during their first visit. At the initial visit, the subjects underwent a clinical examination, and anthropometric data were collected along with blood and urine samples. All participants were instructed by a nutritionist (EL) on how to prepare their breakfast, based on the data from the nutrition questionnaire. Ready-made food for lunch, dinner, and snacks was delivered in a cooler bag to the subjects at home, three times a week and free of charge, along with written information and recipes for the final meal preparation.",728ba7aa-9113-4d09-81b1-1b7ca158daa8

No new dietary supplements such as fish oil, probiotics, or multivitamin drugs were allowed to be introduced during the study period. At most, one visit to a restaurant or change to another diet per week was allowed. Journeys or a stay for a long period at another place had to be discussed with the principal investigator (PI). Smoking habits were not changed during the study. Maximal intake of alcoholic beverages was set to 30 g ethanol/week. The nutritionist had a close contact with the subjects to support them and enhance compliance as much as possible.  At 2 weeks, anthropometric and clinical measurements were checked along with selected blood tests including fasting plasma glucose, C-peptide, insulin, and proinsulin, and a dietary follow-up was carried out with the ability to adjust the diet for energy content and composition when required.",148657f5-75db-4c60-b902-c4852dc0d390

The breakfast was exempt; the subjects had to buy breakfast themselves. Three alternatives were suggested, depending on their ordinary breakfast ingested, described in the nutrition questionnaire. The diet was based on the traditional Okinawan diet (6, 14), but it was modified and developed in the kitchen to suit the Nordic diet with tastes and food components suitable for the Nordic population. The meal composition was close to a moderately low carbohydrate-rich diet, one of four recommended diets from the Swedish National Food Agency for patients with diabetes (15). These recommendations are also in line with international recommendations (16, 17). The diet consists of ordinary raws, but with minimal industrial processing.",12be3a63-ae5b-4c52-901c-f81be4bdbac4

Simultaneously, the amount of sugar, white flour, read meat, processed meat, and dairy products is limited. Actually, to promote a low glycemic response, the content of high glycemic index (GI) foods was reduced radically (e.g. white flour and sugar) in favor of nutrients with low impact on the blood sugar (Table 1). The diet has a good nutritional supply including a mean calorie intake of about 1,900 kcal/day. The participants were allowed to eat three meals a day including breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and two snacks between meals consisting of a variety of fruits, berries, and seeds (Table 1).

Health-related quality of life Compared with baseline, the mean scores for the RAND-36 scale improved and were significantly higher for physical functioning (p<0.001), general health (p<0.001), vitality (p=0.011), social functioning (p=0.001), and mental health (p=0.003) after 12 weeks. The largest increase was in the social functioning and physical functioning scales.",68af2431-5e6a-49a0-b082-2cef6dbd96a8
30,results16," The mean values, mean changes, and 95% confidence interval with upper and lower limits are given for eight health concepts at inclusion (baseline); 12 weeks after diet intervention; and 16 weeks after the end of diet intervention (week 28). Comparisons were made between each time point and baseline by using linear mixed effect models. A value of p<0.05 is considered statistically significant. ",248cf06e-c452-4420-92d2-9d3c8a988e53
31,discussion0,"This is the first study to investigate the effects of a modified Okinawan-based Nordic diet in Scandinavian type 2 diabetes subjects. In this 12-week intervention, the dietary intervention led to significant reductions in weight and waist circumference. Beneficial effects in metabolic parameters were achieved, including improvement in glucose-insulin homeostasis, insulin resistance, and lipid homeostasis during reduction of anti-diabetes treatment. The blood pressure was lowered and progressive reductions in the heart and respiratory rates were seen, along with reduction in cortisol levels and improvement of HRQoL.  Most data about food and nutrition are based on epidemiological studies or experimental studies using test solutions or substitution of one or two substances. Few studies are performed as interventional studies on complete meals.",7b7d8352-d2cd-458b-8ec3-69393c4c0aaa
32,discussion1," Consequently, there is a good understanding of individual food groups’ positive impacts on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, but there is no uniform general dietary strategy to prevent diabetes (24). Dietary interventions recommended by the European Society of Cardiology; the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group (17); and the American Diabetes Association (16) emphasize an appropriate intake of total energy and a diet in which fruits, vegetables, whole-grain cereals, legumes, and low-fat protein sources predominate. Specific dietary recommendations include limiting saturated and trans fats and alcohol intake, monitoring carbohydrate consumption, and increasing dietary fiber and foods containing whole grains.",1d86473e-60f4-447c-ab44-89bf1038b867
33,discussion2," The traditional dietary pattern in Okinawa encompasses high consumption of vegetables and legumes (mostly soy in origin); moderate consumption of fish products; low consumption of meat, meat products, and dairy products; and moderate alcohol consumption. The caloric intake is low, but the diet is rich in omega-3 fats, has a high monounsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio, and emphasis on low GI carbohydrates (14).  Low GI diets are associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease (25) and can be useful in the management of glucose levels in patients with diabetes (26). Whole-grain cereals and legumes have been reported to be generally associated with health-beneficial effects (27) including postprandial blood glucose control and reduction in the levels of circulating inflammatory biomarkers (28).",a22e504a-10cc-42c0-8652-b4b3fa98574f
34,discussion3," Furthermore, epidemiological and clinical studies demonstrate that intake of dietary fiber and whole grains is inversely related to obesity (29), type 2 diabetes (30), cancer (31), and cardiovascular disease (32). Dietary fiber's beneficial influence on obesity has been attributed to a decreased caloric density of the foods, reducing the energy intake over time (29); decreased nutrient absorption (33); increased satiety (28); and a slower rate of food ingestion (34). The composition of indigestible carbohydrates has also been shown to diminish episodes of hyperglycemia and related metabolic risk variables through a mechanism involving colonic fermentation (28). Consequently, it has been suggested that low-GI foods, which in addition are rich in whole-grain constituents, could be particularly advantageous to diminish risk factors associated with insulin resistance (28).  Despite a mean calorie intake of 1,900 kcal/day in the Okinawan-based diet, the average weight reduction was 6.",67b8eaeb-e75e-4ce2-88a1-915604336ac1
35,discussion4,"2 kg after 12 weeks, representing 7% of total body weight. Research shows that modest weight loss of 5–10% is associated with improved health outcomes, including lower blood glucose levels, lower blood pressure, and improved lipid levels (35). Observational studies have reported that weight loss more than 5 kg over a 10-year period reduced the risk of diabetes by 50% or more (36). One reason to the present described weight reduction may be an increased satiety found already after a single meal of the diet compared with a traditional meal (10). The Okinawan-based diet composition with more fiber and greater food volume demands more chewing, thereby constituting a slower eating pattern with increased mastication and slower gastric emptying (37), factors that all induce less feeling of hunger and desire to eat (38). Because of the lower carbohydrate content, energy composition is optimized by a higher proportion of protein.",fe4cedf2-c054-4338-9785-6a5c824e703d
36,discussion5," Protein is the most satiating nutrient, and high-protein intake directly activates the arcuate nucleus and nucleus tracts solitaries in the brain, resulting in a suppressed food intake and delayed gastric emptying (39). The concomitant reduction in waist circumference and GGT in this study indicate that weight loss was related to a decrease in abdominal obesity (40). This may be of importance, because a strong relationship between central obesity and cardiovascular disease has been found (41).  During the dietary intervention, the mean fasting plasma glucose values were significantly reduced along with reduced insulin resistance, and decreased HbA1c levels at the end of the intervention period, despite a considerable gradual reduction in anti-diabetes medication. Preproinsulin is processed to proinsulin, before conversion to insulin and C-peptide and stored in secretary granules, awaiting release on demand.",ed8a318c-78f6-4127-817d-0264e0e5f2e4
37,discussion6," If the demand for insulin triggered by insulin resistance reaches a certain threshold, an insufficiency of the cleavage capacity of β cells leads to an increased secretion of intact proinsulin in addition to the desired insulin molecule (42). A large cross-sectional study has confirmed that intact proinsulin is a highly specific marker for insulin resistance (43). Proinsulin and C-peptide have been demonstrated to be cardiovascular risk factors by stimulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 secretion to block fibrinolysis (44) and by pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects (42, 45). The markedly reduced levels of C-peptide, insulin, and proinsulin already 2 weeks after the dietary introduction suggest a rapid reduction of insulin resistance, as indicated by the results for homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)2-IR.",f69d5521-2b44-4de2-a7f8-540a01e64ac1
38,discussion7," These immediate responses may rather depend on dietary changes than by weight changes, because only a single meal of the Okinawan diet attenuated postprandial levels of glucose, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)), C-peptide, and insulin in comparison with a traditional meal (10). Significant improvement was seen in the lipid profile for triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol in the present study, although the fat content was higher than recommended in traditional diabetes diet (16). This may depend on the improved glucose-insulin homeostasis and lower levels of glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), because glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) together with hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia is strongly involved in lipid regulation in humans (46).",65896137-ca79-4f75-9ef9-b3877afec95e
39,discussion8,"  A significant reduction in cortisol levels could be observed, along with a progressive reduction in the heart and respiratory rates and lowering in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Activation of the sympatho-adrenal medullary (sympatho adrenal medullary (SAM)) system and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (hypothalamo pituitary adrenal (HPA)) axis increases cortisol levels, blood pressure and heart rate (47). Excessive activation of these pathways in response to physiological challenges, including food intake, has been linked to the development of numerous chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, anxiety, and depression (48). There are several potential mechanisms behind the observed phenomena of lowered stress levels in the present study.",5a31be3a-3051-40ef-82da-9f30292121f4
40,discussion9," Animal studies suggest that obesity can be associated with increased hypothalamo pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and sympatho adrenal medullary (SAM) system in responses to stress (49), and human studies have shown that adiposity in men is associated with hyperactivity of the hypothalamo pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis after ingestion of a standardized meal consisting of 22% protein, 53% carbohydrates, and 25% fat (50). One study has shown that intake of meals with high carbohydrate content results in a significantly higher hypothalamo pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response in women with predominant visceral body fat distribution, compared with women with peripheral body fat distribution and normal-weighted healthy controls (51). Both the weight reduction and the lower carbohydrate load in the Okinawan-based Nordic diet may have contributed to the reduced stress level.",873ee9e4-18ee-427f-bb7b-248ad171e284
41,discussion10," Furthermore, data indicate a strong relationship between obesity and HRQoL, and even a small weight reduction leads to significant improvements in HRQoL (52).  Although caloric restriction is an effective method of losing body weight and body fat, it becomes more challenging if compliance to the diet cannot be maintained. The impact of home delivery and the pre-portioned meals may have contributed to adherence to dietary restrictions during intervention. However, on the 16-week follow-up after diet intervention, the weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, insulin resistance, and HbA1c remained significantly lower than at baseline, even with sustained reduction in anti-diabetes treatment. Also, diastolic blood pressure and heart and respiratory rates remained lower than at baseline, and a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol was observed at this time.",d603e0a2-c46d-4a62-89a6-88db23ac13d2
42,discussion11," This delayed effect in the improvement of HDL-cholesterol is difficult to explain, but it could be attributed to a continued generally healthier dietary pattern, increased physical activity after the completion of the dietary intervention, or both. Actually, we assume these residual beneficial effects in part to be related to subject's adoption to changed eating habits (e.g. changing breakfast habits, diminished meal size, continuing eating fruit and vegetables, and regular meals). Participants were instructed always to start with the vegetables, to eat slowly and to drink water with the meals, to induce satiety and less intake of energy-rich food. Evidence to this advice comes from studies in which increasing the vegetable portion on the plate by substituting it for meat and grain significantly increased vegetable intake and reduced the energy intake (53, 54).  It remains to determine to what extent the beneficial role depends on dietary composition or weight reduction.",922560bb-dc63-42e9-a7ba-f68f89bc1a34
43,discussion12," Even though some of our findings support an influence of dietary changes, including an immediate metabolic response after diet introduction the first weeks in line with a single meal evaluation of Okinawan-based diet and traditional diet (10), we presume additional beneficial effects as a result of weight changes. A limitation of the present study was that no control group was included. It is a challenge to construct an appropriate control group in open, non-blinded studies. Instead, the participants were characterized at baseline and followed during and after diet intervention, thus being their own controls. A control group provides some evidence that changes occurring over time were not the result of natural temporal trends or of unmeasured events that occurred contemporaneously with the exposure under study. A similar diet interventional study, using a control group advised to follow their habitual diet and physical activity, did however not show any effects on these controls (55).",3962fad1-1990-464d-a05f-3c4dbffce1bb
44,discussion13," Furthermore, these patients were already scheduled for regular, clinical follow-ups at their primary care center. Thus, the psychological benefit of being enrolled in a clinical study should be less than if patients without an established clinical contact had been included.  In conclusion, a modified Okinawan-based Nordic diet seems to be well accepted by the participants and the beneficial health effects is considerable in type 2 diabetes. The dietary intervention led to significant reductions in anthropometric and metabolic parameters with an improvement of HRQoL. Further studies have to be conducted to examine its potential to be applied for practical use in a larger Scandinavian population to reduce the risk for metabolic syndrome and associated diseases.",43476867-27ec-44b7-a81d-bea4ce0b65aa
