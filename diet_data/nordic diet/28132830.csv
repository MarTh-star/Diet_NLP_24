0,analysis0,"Two hypotheses were raised: (1) Intervention with an Okinawa-based Nordic diet affects the concentration of adipokines, control that is cholecystokinin (CCK), cortisol, C-peptide, ghrelin, glucagon, incretins, insulin, PAI-1, and polypeptide YY (PYY), and (2) the hormone concentration correlates with metabolic responses and changes in blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), weight, and waist circumference.  A power analysis was performed a priori based on a previous unpublished pilot study, and we determined that nine subjects were required to demonstrate that a weight reduction of 5–10%, accompanied by lower blood glucose, lower blood pressure, and improved lipid levels, would lead to clinically significant differences in metabolic parameters to reduce cardiovascular risk factors with 80% power at 5% significance level, as postulated in a previous study (22). The variable demanding most subjects to be able to discover was, what we expected, the diastolic blood pressure.",5f734d4c-9de9-4ea1-9823-39aa7e529ae8
1,analysis1," We determined that we needed 18 subjects to demonstrate clinically significant differences in diastolic pressure with 80% power at 5% significance level. To be able to compensate for disappearance, we planned to recruit 25–35 subjects. Two of the recruited subjects interrupted the study at 6 weeks on diet, the time point that was considered as end of the intervention, and data collected at that time point was calculated together with data from subjects with 12 weeks of intervention.  We tested the hypotheses with linear mixed effect models to analyze continuous variables, with random intercept and unstructured co-variances for repeated measures within a subject, with visits as nominal fixed effect, using baseline as reference. We assumed that missing observations were unrelated to the observed value, that is, missing at random.",dd338aec-cc5f-4e7b-b60c-c0c571365619
2,analysis2," In these analyses, predicted mean values and their 95% confidence limits are presented, together with estimates of changes from baseline and 95% confidence limits and P-values for the changes between baseline and week 12 and week 28. Descriptive statistics are given as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and as counts or frequencies for categorical variables. Since we had more than one observation from each subject, partial Spearman’s correlations, controlling for subject, were calculated. Statistics were done using MATLAB R2015a (Mathworks Inc.). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in the calculated changes of values. Due to multiple testing between each hormone and anthropometric and metabolic factors, P < 0.01 was considered statistically significant in the partial correlations.

3,results0,"Basal characteristics In total, 45 patients with diabetes were randomly selected after consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 30 patients (67%) (17 women), mean age 57.5 ± 8.2 (range 40–67) years, accepted the invitation. Reasons for not being included were unwillingness to participate (n = 11), late autoimmune diabetes in adult (late autoimmune diabetes in adult (LADA)) (n = 1), a history of gastric by-pass surgery (n = 1), pregnancy (n = 1), or already on a diet (n = 1) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The mean diabetes duration was 10.4 ± 7.6 (range 1–30) years. The treatment was metformin (40%), metformin in combination with insulin (27%), insulin solely (13%), metformin in combination with sulfonylurea (7%), diet solely (7%), sulfonylurea (3%), or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP 4) inhibitors (3%).",7b6b59d4-8e50-40b9-81cb-9ddadb4f2fd2
4,results1," The most common secondary complication to the disease was autonomic neuropathy and/or peripheral neuropathy (30%), retinopathy (27%), and nephropathy and macroangiopathy (17% in both). Only one patient had a verified gastroparesis.  Sixteen percent had only completed primary school, 57% had completed high school, and 27% had a higher degree of education. The majority, 67%, were employed, whereas 17% were retired. The rest of the patients were on sick leave or unemployed. Twenty of the patients were married or cohabitated, whereas six were divorced or widow/widower, and four were living alone. Smoking and usage of snuff both occurred in 23% of the patients. Half of the patients drank alcoholic beverages once a month or less, 27% drank alcohol 2–4 times a month, 13% drank alcohol 2–3 times a week, and 10% were teetotalers.",fb0a4d10-c612-480d-a662-582a454b0283
5,results2," A moderate but sporadic physical exercise during leisure time was most common (53%), followed by a moderately regular exercise (27%), regular exercise and training (13%), and sedentary leisure time (7%). Antihypertensive medication was prescribed in 63% of patients and lipid-lowering medication in 47%.  Changes in anthropometric and metabolic parameters The mean body mass index (BMI) at inclusion was 29.9 ± 4.1 kg/m2, and 50% of the patients (n = 15) were obese. During the interventional period of 12 weeks, the body weight was reduced (P < 0.001), accompanied by a reduction of body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.001) and waist circumference (P < 0.001), calculated by linear mixed model (Table 1). At week 12, only 12 patients were classified as obese. At week 28, the mean weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference remained significantly lower than at baseline (P < 0.001) (Table 1).",969f0234-d941-449b-9b9c-a23a8cdd872c
6,results7,"05 was considered statistically significant.  Only two patients had diet management as the sole treatment for diabetes. In 15 subjects, the anti-diabetes medication was gradually reduced during dietary intervention, and 2 subjects, 1 on both oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin, had their medication cancelled. Of the other 12 subjects with insulin treatment, 3 had their insulin therapy cancelled and another 8 had their insulin doses reduced.  Many of the patients had irregular meal habits before inclusion in the study, and often omitted breakfast and/or lunch. At the 28-week follow-up, most patients had kept their regular meal order with the same intake of breakfast as during the intervention, and with an increased intake of vegetables and legumes. The composition of lunch and dinner was partly kept.",aef0a1c2-0ff2-4233-83c9-72fb0315812d
7,results8," Seven patients were lost at follow-up because of depression (n = 2), family-related problems (n = 2), unwillingness to show up (n = 2), or work-related time constraints (n = 1) (Supplementary Fig. 1).  Changes in hormonal concentrations At week 12, the plasma or serum levels of control that is cholecystokinin (CCK) (P = 0.005), cortisol (P = 0.015), C-peptide (P = 0.022), glucagon (P = 0.003), GLP-1 (P = 0.013), glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (P < 0.001), insulin (P = 0.004), leptin (P < 0.001), and polypeptide YY (PYY) (P < 0.001) were significantly lowered compared with baseline, calculated by linear mixed model. There was a non-significant decrease of PAI-1 levels (P = 0.082) (Table 3).

8,results12,"  Partial correlations between changes in hormonal levels and anthropometric and metabolic parameters The endocrine changes were in alignment with changes of anthropometric and metabolic parameters (Fig. 1). Changes in concentrations of C-peptide and insulin correlated with changes in values of fasting glucose (rs = 0.474, P < 0.001 vs. rs = 0.344, P = 0.002), triglycerides (rs = 0.652, P < 0.001 vs. rs = 0.413, P < 0.001), and body mass index (BMI) (rs = 0.424, P < 0.001 vs. rs = 0.394, P < 0.001), and correlated inversely with changes in levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) (rs = −0.509, P < 0.001 vs. rs = -0.301, P = 0.006), calculated by partial Spearman´s correlation test. In addition, the changes in C-peptide levels correlated with changes in HbA1c values (rs = 0.315, P = 0.004), and the changes in insulin levels correlated with changes in waist circumference (rs = 0.340, P = 0.006).",6751f9a8-e15b-44cc-a85f-763a8cc098d9
9,results13," Changes in glucagon and GLP-1 levels both correlated inversely with changes in low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, whereas changed glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels correlated with changed HbA1c values. Changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference correlated inversely with changes in ghrelin concentrations, and positively with changes in leptin concentrations, the latter also being correlated with changes in insulin resistance. Changes in PAI-1 and polypeptide YY (PYY) levels correlated with changes in glucose and triglyceride levels, and polypeptide YY (PYY) levels also correlated with changes of HbA1c values. Changes in resistin levels correlated with changes in systolic blood pressure (Table 4). There was no correlation between changes in control that is cholecystokinin (CCK), cortisol, or visfatin levels and any calculated parameters (data not shown).

10,discussion0,"Based on the study results presented here, we accepted the research hypothesis that intervention with the Okinawa-based Nordic diet affects several hormones released from the gut and pancreas with lower circulating levels of control that is cholecystokinin (CCK), C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), insulin, and polypeptide YY (PYY). The concentrations of cortisol and leptin were reduced, and PAI-1 non-significantly reduced, after 12 weeks, whereas visfatin levels were reduced and resistin non-significantly reduced, after 28 weeks. Apart from control that is cholecystokinin (CCK), cortisol, and visfatin levels, changes in hormonal levels correlated with the improved anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Despite reductions of weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference, the ghrelin levels were reduced after 28 weeks, compared to baseline.",08550b47-eca9-4722-9e8a-62f439c8792e
11,discussion1,"  The majority of the metabolic and anthropometric changes could be correlated with the endocrine profile, as expected from the literature (5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 16). The endocrine changes may be induced by the diet per se, secondary to the metabolic changes, or secondary to the weight reduction. After a single Okinawa-based Nordic breakfast to healthy subjects, the postprandial response of glucose, C-peptide, insulin, and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) were attenuated compared with a traditional breakfast (4). The strongest correlations between anthropometric and metabolic parameters and hormone levels in the present study were observed with C-peptide and insulin levels, which suggest that the immediate endocrine response to the diet is crucial for the evolution of further effects. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that normalization of blood glucose per se did not affect postprandial levels of GLP-1 and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (23).",4444fea1-c421-4e7b-884b-96814338abad
12,discussion2,"  Both orexigenic (ghrelin) and anorexigenic hormone levels (control that is cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon, GLP-1, insulin, leptin, and polypeptide YY (PYY)) were decreased in the present study. The overall decrease of hormonal levels reflects a balance in between the hormones; a decrease in one hormone level initiates a process of further influences. A reduction of GLP-1 and endogenous insulin production, as measured by reduced C-peptide levels, may depend on the reduced carbohydrate content and higher protein content in the diet (24), whereas the reduction in glucagon may be ascribed to the introduction of regular meals with shorter meal intervals, thereby improving substrate oxidation beneficially (25). Although the diet had a relatively high fat and protein content, the concentration of control that is cholecystokinin (CCK) and polypeptide YY (PYY) were reduced after the dietary intervention.",e4bada07-9f99-4048-b8a7-373cf4d849e7
13,discussion3," However, the study participant’s ordinary food may have had higher total amount of fat and protein than the Okinawa-based Nordic diet.  Although reductions of weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure remained at 28 weeks after study start, the hormonal levels, apart from polypeptide YY (PYY), had normalized. Noteworthy, ghrelin levels were reduced at follow-up. This is very interesting, since a previous study with a low-energy diet showed that the induced hormonal changes to increase sensation of hunger and encourage weight regain persisted until 1 year later, with elevated levels of ghrelin, which can explain the difficulties to maintain weight loss (26). Lower ghrelin levels render reduced appetite and less hunger (27). By changing the nutritional composition in the Okinawa-based Nordic diet, and not only reducing caloric intake, our participants exhibited lower ghrelin levels and increased or equal satiety with a good ability to maintain the weight loss (4, 28).",74efb135-4cbf-4b31-93c2-2ab9a549936e
14,discussion4," This delayed effect on ghrelin may suggest a readjustment of appetite regulation and food intake after introduction of a healthier diet. The participants partly withheld the diet between 12 and 28 weeks, which may have contributed to a new balance in the hormonal system. This further suggests that dietary components have a huge influence on the endocrine control, and that the present endocrine alterations do not only depend on weight reduction per se. Previous research supports nutrient-specific effects on ghrelin secretion, which may counteract the elevated levels observed after weight loss in other studies (29). However, there may be synergistic effects between a healthy diet, improved metabolism, and weight reduction, but exact mechanisms are difficult to separate. Still, the most important from a clinical point of view is that introduction of a modified diet is correlated with a healthier endocrine profile. The weight loss of 0.",3cc0e6ca-186e-4327-825f-c38ed17d34bd
15,discussion5,"5 kg/week was in the same magnitude as observed in previous, similar studies (30).  glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has specific anabolic effects and enhances insulin secretion and insulin stimulation, which promotes accumulation of fat in adipose tissue (31). It is considered important to diminish the exaggerated glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) secretion, which demands altered chemical and physical food composition, as well as altered eating behaviors (32–34). The present results are in line with the anticipation that an overactive entero-insular axis may play a role in the development of diabetes and obesity (32).  Circulating adipokine levels are increased in obese subjects. Leptin and insulin show a strong relationship, and leptin resistance is accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (14).",027b78a8-109e-4a52-aa0c-b1c8f03496f7
16,discussion6," The observed reduction of insulin concentration and insulin resistance by the Okinawa-based Nordic diet seem to be interconnected with lower levels of adipokines, although the close relation between resistin and insulin resistance found in other studies could not be confirmed in the present study (14). Resistin levels are elevated in hypertension (35), and, thus, the parallel decrease of systolic blood pressure and resistin in the present study is in alignment with this. Changes in cortisol levels may result from a multitude of factors including both diet (36) and stress in daily life (17).  It remains to determine which of the ingredients in the food are responsible for the observed hormonal and metabolic responses. The physical properties of the food were altered through higher fiber intake demanding more mastication, slower eating, greater gastric volume, and delayed gastric emptying rate.",46b954e5-7847-456f-8ff3-e4bd8026f89c
17,discussion7," The chemical characteristics were changed with reduction of GI and processed food, lower energy percentage intake of carbohydrates, and higher energy percentage intake of fat and protein. In addition, most subjects had irregular meal habits at inclusion. Only a reduction of meal frequencies, without changes in the nutrition composition, may have great impact on glucose and hormone levels (37). The Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet has similarities with the Okinawa-based diet regarding a high amount of whole grains, vegetables, and legumes, and no added sugar. In contrast, the daily energy percentages consist of 70 E% carbohydrate, 18 E% fat, and 12 E% protein (38). Still, these two diets have similar effects on type 2 diabetes (3, 38), which support previous suggestion that whole-grain cereals, high fiber intake, and unprocessed food is more important than the relative amounts of nutrients (39, 40).",d983b80e-b09b-4533-b551-ad7329def996
18,discussion8," Fibers and whole grains act as prebiotics (41), which has been shown to increase polypeptide YY (PYY) and GLP-1 secretion (38), in contrast to our findings. In epidemiologic studies, mortality was lower in subjects with a high intake of whole-grain products, especially intake of breakfast cereals and nonwhite bread (42). Regular consumption of breakfast cereals, especially whole grains, is associated with less overweight and development and management of diabetes (43). The association between high intake of whole-grain products and overall healthier lifestyle habits may reduce the associations to be markers of healthy habits (44). In the present prospective study, the positive effects by dietary modification were observed without concomitant intervention of other lifestyle factors and independently of socioeconomic factors.  One of the limitations of the present study was that only fasting hormonal levels were analyzed and not the total area under the curve during the day.",6084564b-9c94-41f9-9339-f0410ae2a0ee
19,discussion9," Varying degrees of diabetic complications may also affect results. In the present study, only one patient had verified gastroparesis, which should not influence the result. More patients suffered from autonomic neuropathy, which is, however, not associated with altered concentration of gut hormones in type 1 diabetes (45). Another limitation is the absence of an external control group, which provides some evidence that changes occurring over time were not the result of natural temporal trends or of unmeasured events that occurred contemporaneously with the study. It is a challenge to construct an appropriate control group in open, nonblinded lifestyle studies. A similar dietary interventional study using a control group advised to follow their habitual diet and physical activity did however not show any changes in the controls during the observational time (30).",b10ec186-d727-4b3c-99ed-13d6f0f2b9e0
20,discussion10," Instead, the participants were characterized at baseline and followed during and after dietary intervention, thus being their own controls to measure intra-individual differences. When people anticipate eating a scheduled meal, cephalic responses induce an increased secretion of several meal-related hormones before the start of the meal (46). Thus, the very expectancy of entering a lifestyle change should have altered the hormonal profile already at baseline. The alterations found thereafter should be secondary to dietary changes, metabolic alterations, and/or weight reductions.  In conclusion, a 12-week dietary intervention in type 2 diabetes with an Okinawa-based Nordic diet has significant impact on the endocrine profile, which is in alignment with the anthropometric and metabolic improvements.",56c15c45-f26d-4972-b121-2907159ce196
