0,abstract0," High sodium concentration alters leukocyte activation, and in particular T‐helper (Th) lymphocyte polarization, and drives the development of autoimmune diseases in mouse studies. Similar results have been obtained with human leukocytes under in vitro settings and in few observational studies. Therefore, salt has been implicated as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases. Here, we examined whether physiologically relevant changes in salt intake or diet alter cytokine concentrations. In a 20‐wk double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled study 106 participants were randomized to Habitual and Healthy Nordic diets, and further to Usual Sodium and Reduced Sodium intake groups using a cross‐over setup.

1,abstract1," Repeated analyses of covariance revealed that high salt ingestion (or changes in the diet) did not induce significant changes in any of the signature cytokines controlling Th1, Th2 or Th17 polarization. Several other pro‐inflammatory interleukins, chemokines and growth factors were also unaffected by the level of salt intake or changes in the diet. We conclude that in humans clinically relevant changes in salt intake or diet do not have reflections on the systemic concentrations of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in vivo.  The effect of habitual Western diet and salt‐reduced diet on the levels of systemic blood cytokines was analyzed in a placebo‐controlled nutritional intervention study. The results showed that reduced salt intake did not alter the concentrations of any of the analyzed 34 cytokines in blood. Our data show that marked real‐word changes in the diet can take place without any significant reflections on the systemic cytokine mileu in humans.",222b4d83-45d5-45a9-b132-30e3a1b51089

Malnourishment is associated with impaired immune responses against microbes, whereas high‐fat diet induces a chronic low‐level inflammation in the body. Individual nutrients also have direct effects on the immune system. For instance, palmitic acid triggers Toll like receptor 2 activation, cytokine signaling and inflammation in the intestinal wall, vitamin A controls site‐specific activation of dendritic cells and phosphatidylcholine‐derived trimethylamine activates pro‐inflammatory macrophages [4, 5, 6].",c04272c6-d778-4918-9a81-cfbcbbf4b4ea
3,abstract3," On the other hand, carbazoles (from cruciferous vegetables), flavonoids and polyphenols promote the differentiation of anti‐inflammatory leukocytes and generation of anti‐inflammatory cytokines via triggering of aryl hydrocarbon receptors. Short chain fatty acids (generated from dietary fibers by bacterial fermentation) and omega‐3‐fatty acids promote anti‐inflammatory responses via other receptors [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].  Sodium is another nutrient which not only regulates the blood pressure, but is also thought to have direct pro‐inflammatory and autoimmune disease‐inducing effects on the immune system [12, 13, 14, 15]. In mouse studies high‐salt diet alters the development of different cytokine‐producing T‐helper types.",622b4386-d646-4c94-ae1a-cfaac3724128
4,abstract4," High sodium intake enhances the polarization of naïve T‐helper cells into pathogenic T‐helper 17 (Th17) lymphocytes and drives the development of multiple sclerosis‐like pathology by activating p38/MAPK and serum/glucocorticoid‐regulated kinase1 signaling pathways [16, 17, 18]. High‐salt diet also induces cerebral hypoperfusion and subsequent cognitive impairment in mice by increasing the synthesis of IL‐17, the main effector cytokine secreted by Th17 cells [14]. In mouse studies Th2‐type, and possibly Th1‐type, inflammatory reactions are also enhanced by increased sodium concentrations, while suppressive functions of regulatory T‐cells are inhibited [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Similar salt‐induced changes in the polarization of human T‐helper cell subsets have been observed under in vitro conditions [14, 16, 17, 19‐22].",94fd94a6-c521-4fbb-add2-eb1c41de3712
5,abstract5," Therefore, increased dietary salt intake has been suggested to be an environmental risk factor for driving pro‐inflammatory lymphocyte differentiation, and consequently, for triggering autoimmune and vascular diseases [12, 13, 26]. High salt has also been shown to impair the differentiation of myeloid derived suppressor cells, monocytes, and macrophages into immune‐suppressive cell types, which can aggravate autoimmunity but have beneficial effects on antitumor immunity and in control of selected microbial infections [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. In other infections, salt‐induced suppression of neutrophil functions has instead led to aggravated disease course [33]. If excess salt intake exacerbated the development of inflammatory diseases, improved anti‐tumor immune responses or modulated anti‐bacterial immunity this would have a huge impact, since the majority of Western people constantly ingest salt in excess of the dietary recommendations [34].",d7d0a66c-f46d-4dfb-8ae4-5bb41fef83e6
6,abstract6,"  No study, to our knowledge, has examined the effect of salt intake on cytokine concentrations in a placebo‐controlled, intervention study setup.

7,methods0," Participants and the design of the trial  Previously untreated mildly hypertensive men and women (45‐77 years) living in Southwestern Finland were screened from individuals, who had earlier participated in a national FINRISK 2007 health survey [52]. Potential participants were invited for briefing about the study, for giving their informed consent and for screening.  The subject could be included in the study if mean resting systolic blood pressure was 140–160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure was 90–100 mmHg. The participants filled in questionnaires for medical history. Individuals who were vegetarians or smoked, or with regular medication or vitamin use, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, fish allergies, a body mass index higher than 35 kg/m2, or excessive alcohol use were excluded from the study.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after treatments (to be reported separately), and secondary outcomes included change from baseline in biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risks (from which cytokines are reported here).  Participants included in the study first entered a 1‐week period during which they practiced maintaining a low sodium diet with a goal of 5 grams of salt per day (Figure 1). At the end of this period, 24‐h urinary sodium excretion was measured. Based on the results, each participant was given a unique number of sodium tablets to raise his/her salt intake to a high level (10 g/d) for the following 3 weeks. After this period, the participants were randomly allocated to a Healthy Nordic Diet or a Habitual Diet group (see below) at week 4.",94c27eee-722d-47de-acfb-7efecd04b293

26,discussion0," The results from our clinical study show that the diet (fish and vegetable enriched Healthy Nordic Diet) or reduced salt intake does not change the levels of circulating cytokines in humans. We find the placebo‐controlled cross‐over study design, objective measurement of sodium excretion and relatively long duration (8+8 wk interventions) as strengths of our study. The provocative results on the salt‐induced Th2 and Th17 expansion, and their association with aggravated autoimmune reactivity in mice, thus seem not to be directly translatable into humans under physiologically relevant in vivo settings.  The reasons for the discrepant results between our study and those using mouse models may include genuine species‐specific differences in electrolyte metabolism and immune cell activation. Moreover, in the in vivo mouse experiments the animals have been suddenly exposed to chow, which contains 4–5% salt [14, 16, 17, 21, 22]. This is 8–16× more than laboratory mice normally ingest.",63ba6385-4cd2-4ed1-a4d7-7d6d23297d3f
27,discussion1," In humans, in contrast, typical sodium ingestion in Western countries equals to 8.7–10.1 g of salt per day [36], which corresponds well to the sodium excretion values we measured in our study. Our Usual Salt Diet caused about 1.6‐fold increase in salt intake in comparison to Reduced Salt Diet, which is strikingly different from the massive salt loading used in mice models. When human lymphocytes were shown to polarize to Th17 direction in a salt‐inducible manner in vitro, a high salt concentration together with exogenous, Th polarizing cytokines was needed [14, 16, 17, 21, 22]. Notably all these previously used in vitro and in vivo conditions are clearly different from our current in vivo intervention trial.  A few studies have reported salt‐induced changes in cytokine secretion in humans under in vivo settings.",b90286f4-a356-43a5-bee5-0906795f3d48

Analyses of plasma TNFα, IL‐6, IL‐10 and IL‐17 did not reveal statistically different changes during the different salt ingestion phases [37]. In another study with eight volunteers, a 6 g/d increase in salt ingestion (estimated mean total salt intake 13.8 g/d) for 2 weeks resulted in a minor increase in Th17 positive cells in an open label setting study (using one tailed t‐test) [22]. Similarly, an increase in plasma IL‐17 was reported when a 7 day diet with very low salt intake (3 g/d) was switched into a very high salt intake (18 g/d) for another week [38]. Of note, both studies were open‐label and the compliance of the study subjects with the different salt intake was not verified using quantitative laboratory analyses.",cc43e8f0-2474-4cef-b897-7fd78f2c7660
29,discussion3," Collectively, our study and the previous studies imply to us that although acute, extremely high salt exposure may induce detectable changes in cytokine concentrations, physiologically relevant changes in the long‐term diets are unlikely to provoke a pro‐inflammatory cytokine profile in humans.  Mediterranean diet is consistently found to lower the systemic levels of pro‐inflammatory biomarkers [39], while the effects of Healthy Nordic Diet on inflammatory mediators have not been studied as thoroughly. The two diets have several common features, including increased use of fruits, vegetables (and berries in the Healthy Nordic Diet), whole‐grain products and fish, and restrictions in the use of saturated fats and red meat. In two large observational studies (altogether >6400 participants), Healthy Nordic Diet associated with lower hs‐CRP concentrations, while no changes in plasma TNF and IL‐6 concentrations were reported [40].",c68730c8-1c55-415e-ac99-8c3caacb9b71

In two other controlled trials (NORDIET and syndrome – a randomized study (SYSDIET)), the changes in CRP were not reproduced [42, 43]. In the syndrome – a randomized study (SYSDIET) study, increase in IL1Ra concentrations was found, whereas the concentrations of the other measured cytokines (IL‐1β, IL‐6, IL‐10) were not altered [43]. Findings in our current cross‐over intervention study with an extended cytokine panel are consistent with the earlier analyses in suggesting that Healthy Nordic Diet does not cause any major alterations in the systemic concentrations of inflammatory cytokines.  Our study has several limitations. It includes a relatively small and heterogeneous group of mildly hypertensive individuals.",7d7d4b03-1002-43cf-852c-b478b9d4b364
31,discussion5," The power calculations were done for the primary end point (blood pressure) and therefore higher number of participants would have increased the power of several cytokine analyses, although the cross‐over setup (each individual serving as her/his own control) is a clear strength in our study. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that longer (or shorter) alterations in salt or diet would have altered cytokine levels. However, in other studies other types of dietary interventions have resulted in detectable alterations in cytokine levels in less than 8 weeks (e.g., [44, 45, 46]) indicating the duration of our study is at the physiologically relevant range. Moreover, we were not able to reach truly Low Salt –diet, which is typical challenge of real‐world Western intervention studies, and therefore it remains possible that the cytokine levels in our Reduced Salt groups are already induced by the salt levels which are higher than in most non‐Western populations.",2180127a-c73b-4d72-8034-835a0c45be0b
32,discussion6," In addition, we only had fasting plasma samples available for measuring the soluble cytokines. Moreover, salt can be stored at higher concentrations in extrarenal tissues, where it is bound to the glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix [32, 47].Therefore, it remains possible that salt or diet would induce detectable changes in local cytokine levels in peripheral tissues. However, it is of note that while an association between salt intake and activity of multiple sclerosis has been reported [26], other studies have failed to confirm it [48, 49].The production of proinflammatory cytokines by human in vitro cultured monocytes/macrophages is reported to be affected by sudden exposure to high salinity [50]. In our study setting it is impossible to determine which cell types (T‐lymphocytes, macrophages, others) contribute to the secretion of soluble cytokines, and if a certain cell type would respond to high sodium diet.",dbd7f851-23ce-445c-856b-6c5f95575aab
33,discussion7," Moreover, blood leukocytes were not collected from the participants, and therefore we were unable to analyze cytokine levels within T‐helper lymphocytes. Finally, the gut microbiota may have an essential role in mediating salt‐triggered changes in cytokine excretion [22, 51], but we do not have the possibility to study salt and diet induced changes in the intestinal microbiota.  In conclusion, our data suggest that increased salt intake at the levels seen in everyday life do not affect systemic cytokine levels in humans. Therefore, salt induced changes in cytokines are unlikely to induce the differentiation of pathogenic Th2 and Th17 responses in humans. These observations have important implications in immunology and medicine, since they do not support the literature proposing that increased salt intake might precipitate the emergence of autoimmune disease or that restricting salt intake would be a therapeutic option for treating autoimmune disorders.
