Ten percent of the study population was classified as overweight/obese according to the international age- and gender-specific child BMI cut-off points (32) (Table 1). All 81 children, assisted by parents, recorded their diet in the WebDASC and wore the accelerometer for at least five days or more in the WebDASC at baseline. At intervention, 78 had acceptable food recording and 73 had acceptable accelerometer results, which meant that 72 children (28 boys; 44 girls) had measurement data for both EI and total energy expenditure (TEE) for the intervention period. Ninety-four percent had complete data for all seven days at baseline and 90% at intervention.

Intervention effect and interactions with EI:total energy expenditure (TEE) The results from the linear-mixed models show that main effects of age, parental educational level, and measurement period (baseline vs. intervention) were not significantly associated with EI:total energy expenditure (TEE). Respondents who were not affected by illness had an 11% higher EI:total energy expenditure (TEE) than those who were affected, mainly because of a higher EI (1,233 kJ/d higher).",95e9f60b-1857-4cbb-a835-d268f59c7e1a

8,discussion0,"Comparison of the WebDASC-estimated EI and the accelerometer-derived total energy expenditure (TEE) indicated agreement at the group level. At individual level, the data showed substantial variation in accuracy. The ability of the WebDASC to rank individuals according to total energy expenditure (TEE) was generally good and slightly better at baseline than at intervention. This difference may be due to difficulties in recording the New Nordic Diet (NND), which included perhaps unfamiliar foods and dishes. Previous studies have shown that it is more difficult for children to record unfamiliar foods than familiar foods (34), so it is essential to make it easy to record the New Nordic Diet (NND) intervention foods in the WebDASC. Ideally, participants should have the daily menu beside them when recording so that they can accurately recall the names of the dishes. The daily menu was accessible in the WebDASC from the front page, but perhaps not everyone used this option.",847490d0-5b56-4f2a-86b4-34836bbc51d3
9,discussion1,"  As far as the authors are aware, no other studies have evaluated EI assessed by a seven-day Web-based dietary assessment method against an objective method for total energy expenditure (TEE). A few validation studies with children of similar age have used motion instruments as a reference method to validate paper versions of food records (24, 25). In these studies, EI was underestimated by 7–20% at group level in children aged 7–13 (7–20% (25); 18% (24)). In comparison, the present study showed less than 1% underestimation of EI at group level. At the individual level, the above-mentioned studies produced Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.28 (24) and 0.29 (25) compared to 0.31 in the present study. Comparison of cross-classification and underreporting also showed similar results between the studies.",28465c73-5b5f-48ae-b294-6f3354d9ff03
10,discussion2," Considering the challenges involved in recording the New Nordic Diet (NND), it seems that the WebDASC performs just as well as other (paper-based) methods when compared with total energy expenditure (TEE) derived from motion instruments.  Illness affected many children's eating during the recording periods – 27 and 14 reported that illness affected their dietary intake during the baseline and intervention period respectively, due to a flu epidemic. This may have affected the correlation analysis. Twenty-seven percent of the schoolchildren recorded a lower EI than their calculated basal metabolic rate (BMR); half of these reported that they had eaten less than usual because of illness. Leaving out these individuals underreporting dropped to around 16%, which is similar to the findings in other studies (36).",0a8e190f-c72e-49d7-9812-c92807563ff6
11,discussion3," But using total energy expenditure (TEE) as a reference measure for EI under these circumstances may be a problem, because basal metabolic rate (BMR) is a large component of total energy expenditure (TEE) (70% of total energy expenditure (TEE) in the present study). total energy expenditure (TEE) will never be less than basal metabolic rate (BMR), whereas EI can vary from a zero intake during illness and upwards. The wide variation in EI compared to the underestimated variation in total energy expenditure (TEE) may have exaggerated the difference between EI and total energy expenditure (TEE). Correlations performed with the variable part of total energy expenditure (TEE), the Activity energy expenditure (AEE), produced a higher correlation of 0.4 overall.",e2948610-e964-4c29-b099-a3d6c8b0f665
12,discussion4," Compared to the total energy expenditure (TEE) estimated from Activity energy expenditure (AEE), basal metabolic rate (BMR), and diet induced thermogenesis (DIT), the estimated EI therefore seemed to perform slightly worse in the current study than would be expected under normal circumstances.  Misreporting Approximately 20% were classified as over-reporters and 20% as under-reporters. This is different from other validation studies using motion sensors to validate EI in children, which argue that under-reporting is a large problem (23, 24, 35). Data from studies documenting over-reporting of EI in children are sparse. In the review of Forrestal (36), only two studies described substantial over-reporting in children aged 9 and 4–11, respectively.",7266f332-489f-4b40-943d-888d7b60f438
13,discussion5," Using portion size images for portion size estimation of all foods and beverages recorded in the WebDASC may have made it easier to be consistent in either under- or over-reporting compared to other similar dietary assessment methods using a mixture of standard portions and portion size images (10, 24, 25).  In the present study, the children characterized as over-reporters had lower BMI compared to acceptable reporters and under-reporters. This was also observed in a study among children aged 4–11, in which over-reporters weighed less than under- and accurate reporters (37). These findings support the idea that children with a low BMI (or their parents) may be more likely to report larger portion-sizes as they wish (for their child) to increase growth and eat more. It has been shown that maternal pressure to eat is inversely correlated to children's BMI (38).",95c93148-b4ea-41df-8bfd-f43c24584c6a
14,discussion6,"  Under-reporters were more likely than both acceptable and over-reporters to report that illness affected eating during the recording periods. This was confirmed by the results from the linear-mixed models that showed that absence of illness influenced EI:total energy expenditure (TEE) positively. This has also been reported in a study with adults, in which illness during the recording period had a significant impact on under-reporting (39). A German validation study with children and adolescents (1–18 years) found, in agreement with these findings, that acceptable reporters had a higher percentage of normal recording days (36).  Under-reporters had higher BMI and recorded less EI compared to acceptable and over-reporters. Other studies have also shown that under-reporters aged 7–11 have higher BMI and are more worried about weight than acceptable reporters and over-reporters (40–42).",1a75b40e-66ad-4162-8b79-fa2a400ba862
15,discussion7," Recording accuracy may also be compromised by overweight parents underestimating their children's intake (42). Parents in the present study were more likely to be overweight than a representative sample of parents for the same age group in the Danish National Survey of Diet and Physical Activity (Danish National Survey of Diet and Physical Activity (DANSDA)) 2003–2008 (54% vs. 42%).  Repeatability of recorded EI The repeatability of EI between baseline and intervention was moderate. There were some limitations with the repeatability assessment, because the conditions between the baseline and intervention period differed with the New Nordic Diet (NND) served for school lunch and snacks in the intervention period. It seems reasonable to expect that reported EI should be approximately at the same level during the two periods since the intervention only covered school meals where food were offered ad-libitum.",916a7fdc-ddf7-4527-8847-441169ced835
16,discussion8," However, it may have been more difficult for the children and their parents to report the New Nordic Diet (NND) in the WebDASC than their usual packed lunches. This may be reflected in the moderate repeatability.  Due to limited resources and the design of the pilot study, the children were only weighed once (after the baseline reporting period). Energy balance could therefore not be confirmed in the present study. However, the dietary assessment period was too short for energy imbalance to present as notable weight change.  During growth and development children are normally in a positive energy balance, but energy accretion is about 1–2% of EI (34, 43), which would not influence the overall results.",8d576bcc-b17c-4fbd-aba8-1f8303a70fbb
17,discussion9,"  Strengths and limitations One major strength in the present study lies in the use of a reference method to derive total energy expenditure (TEE), which do not have any errors correlated with the dietary assessment method, as would be a risk if another dietary assessment method was chosen as the reference. Other validation studies of web-based methods in connection with children have used relative validation methods (7, 9, 15). We have used an objective method, which has proved useful with both children and adults (19, 44).  The results from the qualitative questionnaire showed that the WebDASC method was well accepted by participants, who also provided useful feedback for improving the interactive recording method. The present study population consisted of a higher proportion of children whose parents have a vocational education than is the case in the general population (data not shown). This suggests that WebDASC works well, irrespective of parental educational level.",78428aff-e6be-4f00-857e-848a317867c8
18,discussion10,"  Moreover, we found no difference in recorded EI between measurement periods in the present study. This may be a result of the standardized WebDASC interface guiding respondents through all meals, the use of questions with a conditional response option, which makes it difficult to skip responses, and the use of probing and internal checks to enhance memory and food recording.  In general, the recorded level of EI is low compared to EI recorded by the same age group in the Danish National Survey of Diet and Physical Activity (DANSDA) 2003–2008 and compared to international reference values, but total energy expenditure (TEE) was also low. This could be a seasonal effect because data were collected during the winter, whereas Danish National Survey of Diet and Physical Activity (DANSDA) data are collected throughout the year (45). Kolle et al.",51d3ff7a-84ac-4ffe-b61d-dbdd85e2ff8c
19,discussion11," (46) also found seasonal variations in physical activity level where they used accelerometers in a representative sample of 9-year-old Norwegian children, with their physical activity level being lowest during the winter. Furthermore, a large number of children reported illness during both periods, due to a flu epidemic. As a result of the seasonal low activity level and the illness among children, we measured less variation in Activity energy expenditure (AEE) than expected and Activity energy expenditure (AEE) accounted for 20% of total energy expenditure (TEE).  Accelerometer-determined total energy expenditure (TEE) Accelerometers do not accurately capture certain forms of activity, such as arm movement, carrying loads, and cycling, due to the way the instrument is designed. Moreover, the accelerometer was removed during water activities, such as swimming.",e6f913d4-e91b-4abc-83f3-66e40becc508
20,discussion12," However, the average duration of these activities was very low (14 min/day) in the present study, and cannot explain the low total energy expenditure (TEE).  Errors can have been introduced in estimating the different parts of total energy expenditure (TEE), because the choice of cut-off for non-wear time to derive Activity energy expenditure (AEE) may have affected the number of misreporters in either direction. There is no consensus about the most appropriate energy expenditure prediction equation to use with regard to accelerometer data, including how to distinguish between periods of non-wear and bouts of sedentary behaviour (47). The prediction equation used in the present study to derive Activity energy expenditure (AEE) is based on a small number of participants. However, it is derived from double-labelled water measurements, and as far as the authors know, this is the only equation based on free-living European children of the same age-group as in the present study (27).",e180ece0-729d-4649-86dc-a4499343b962
21,discussion13," The accelerometers used in this study have also been shown to have good agreement with the double-labelled water technique comparing total energy expenditure (TEE)dlw to Activity energy expenditure (AEE), total energy expenditure (TEE) or accelerometer counts (48).  Conclusion The WebDASC is both acceptable and feasible to use for collecting dietary data from schoolchildren aged 8–11 in a normal situation when children eat their usual packed lunches and during an intervention in which they are served an New Nordic Diet (NND) for school lunch and snacks. It performed better when estimating EI at group level and just as well when ranking individuals according to total energy expenditure (TEE) when compared to other data-collecting methods in children. In the present study, recording accuracy was influenced by the child's gender, BMI, and illness.",76593501-5122-4315-91e8-2e202dc45ae8
22,discussion14,"  More work needs to be done to optimize dietary data collection, for example, it should be investigated if the inclusion of a speech search could make up for the spelling competences of children (and adults), and if portion size estimation could be improved by using 3D images or other technology. Furthermore, it should be investigated how the web-based technology can help minimize misreporting. It looks as if the WebDASC will prove a very useful tool in future research of this kind.
