Potatoes With respect to the three outcomes (cardiovascular disease (CVD)/CHD, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory markers) examined in relation to potato consumption, only one paper met the quality criteria (for diabetes, graded B) (Table 5). In the US Nurses’ Health Study, consumption of potatoes (mainly deep-fried, baked, or mashed) was associated with increased risk of diabetes, which persisted in obese but not in lean women after stratification. The one study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was graded C and not included. No articles were retrieved in the updated search. Therefore, no conclusion could be drawn regarding the associations between potato consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD)/CHD, type 2 diabetes, or inflammatory markers.",4c705419-c3df-4db2-bded-918cc3a2bba5
26,results32,"  Berries Two studies – graded B – were included examining the association between berry consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD)/CHD incidence or mortality in the general population. Both of these observational studies were carried out in the United States, which makes their implications for Nordic countries questionable. Nevertheless, no conclusion could be drawn because of the inadequate number of studies, which in addition produced mixed results.  No studies of the association between berry consumption and type 2 diabetes were identified. Five intervention studies examining the effect of berry consumption on inflammatory markers produced mixed results. Therefore, no conclusion could be drawn even for this endpoint.  Whole grains Out of the seven identified studies, all conducted in the United States, exploring the association between whole-grain consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD)/CHD incidence or mortality, six met the quality criteria (graded B).",c6a7b823-a0f8-4fac-9b9f-94c2b813e262
27,results33," These studies consistently indicated that whole-grain consumption was associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)/CHD incidence or mortality; the evidence grade was moderate for total cardiovascular disease (CVD), indicating a probable protective association. It should be noted, however, that the evidence was insufficient for specific outcomes such as stroke or heart failure.  Five observational studies and one intervention study (examining the effects of rye bread on plasma glucose and insulin response) of type 2 diabetes and intermediate biomarkers of type 2 diabetes met the quality criteria (all graded B). In the observational studies, the highest or second highest exposure quintile/quartile was consistently associated with lower risk of incident type 2 diabetes. In the intervention study, whole-grain consumption increased the insulin response but had no effect on plasma glucose.",30172699-082c-4aac-8d55-152a1825bdc9
28,results34," The evidence of the effect of whole grains on diabetes was considered moderate in strength, leading to the conclusion that higher whole-grain intake probably reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. Most of the studies were carried out in the United States, but a Finnish study produced similar results. Notably, the whole-grain intake was much higher among the participants in Finland, the lowest quartile median intake (79 g/day) in Finland being higher than the highest quintile mean intake (45.6 g/day) found in US studies.  The effect of whole-grain consumption on inflammatory markers was examined in two good-quality studies (graded B), both indicating null associations. Therefore, because of insufficient evidence, no conclusion could be drawn regarding the effect of whole grains on inflammatory markers.  Four out of five studies of the association between whole-grain consumption and colorectal cancer incidence or mortality in the general population met the quality criteria (all graded B).",7010b56d-0d99-4f1b-935f-ff96116b48f2
29,results35," These large cohort studies were conducted in Sweden, Denmark, and the United States. In three of four studies, significant associations were found between whole-grain consumption and reduced colorectal cancer risk, whereas one study obtained null results. The exposure variables were estimated in very different ways across studies, potentially contributing to the mixed results. Nevertheless, the evidence grade was considered low, indicating a suggestive protective association.  Milk and milk products Six outcomes were considered in relation to dairy consumption (Table 5). Six studies of cardiovascular disease (CVD)/CHD met the quality criteria and were graded B; two SRs were also identified. No significant associations were observed between total dairy consumption and any of the cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints. A separate analysis of specific dairy products obtained mixed results.",929c926d-87b8-4a18-a0e2-06c80e7dc701
30,results36," The two SRs concluded that the evidence was either insufficient (63) or that there was no consistent evidence that dairy food was associated with higher risks of CHD (64). Based on this SR, the evidence was rated insufficient regarding any specific dairy product or outcome, so no conclusion was drawn regarding the direction of the association between dairy or milk consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Nevertheless, it was concluded (including in the identified SRs) that no consistent evidence indicates that dairy food consumption is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)/CHD (moderate-grade evidence). The additional articles identified in the updated search in February 2012 supported the above conclusion.  Seven studies of type 2 diabetes and of the intermediate biomarkers of diabetes met the quality criteria, all graded B.",c2c0d975-c609-4463-87da-a1330550a384
31,results37," Total dairy consumption was consistently associated with decreased risk of diabetes in four prospective cohort studies, three studies of diabetes incidence, and one study of insulin resistance (from the United States and Japan). The results varied for specific dairy products, but seemed stronger for low-fat than high-fat dairy. Less support was observed in two studies of insulin sensitivity and blood glucose. In the one randomised intervention study identified, adding three servings of fluid milk per day to the diet did not affect the concentration of HbA1c; the evidence grade was low, and the conclusion was that there is a suggestive protective association between dairy consumption and type 2 diabetes. The updated search found two additional studies indicating inverse associations between dairy consumption and type 2 diabetes incidence and one intervention study obtaining null results for an intermediate biomarker, altogether supporting the above conclusion.",7288b99f-d2bf-4532-a079-2fa62061f4c3
32,results38,"  No conclusion could be drawn regarding milk and milk product consumption and inflammatory markers and bone health, respectively, because of insufficient evidence; the articles retrieved in the updated search supported this result.  Eight studies of milk and milk product consumption and prostate cancer met the quality criteria, all graded B. Increased risk was observed in some studies with comparatively higher exposure levels and a sufficient exposure gradient. Increased risk was observed in a Finnish study, in which the results were similar for different stages and grades of cancer. Increased risk was also observed in a US study. Similarly, a Japanese study observed an increased risk although the intake was lower. However, no significant association was observed in a US study at relatively high intakes, that is, dairy ≥4 servings/day vs. <3 servings/week. The definition of dairy exposure, however, varied between the studies (e.g. some included ice cream while others did not).",4e455b6c-bad2-4bd1-a925-67e7cc98eac4
33,results39," In a US study, an increased risk was observed for low-fat milk only, but after stratification by tumour grade, the significant associations with low- and nonfat-milk were limited to localised or low-grade tumours. Although the results were mixed, an association with increased risk could not be excluded, leading to the conclusion – supported by low-grade evidence – of a suggestive increased risk of (total) prostate cancer with dairy or milk consumption. Evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions regarding specific dairy products.  Red and processed meat Four studies of cardiovascular disease (CVD)/CHD met the quality criteria and were graded B. In two of these studies with varied cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints, increasing red meat (including processed meat) intake was significantly associated with increased risk, whereas no significant association was observed in two studies.",afa96062-ac2c-4b81-99b5-51b57d04add9
34,results40," These four studies indicate that red meat (including processed meat) may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints; however, the insufficient number of studies, their endpoint diversity, and their insufficiently strong evidence meant that a firm conclusion could not be drawn. A systematic review and meta-analysis (65) of papers from the 1990s until 2009 concluded that consumption of processed meat, but not red meat, is associated with higher incidence of CHD (and diabetes mellitus). However, another SR (63) concluded that the evidence was insufficient.  The WCRF update (6) identified 12, 10, and 7 studies of the association between red meat consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer, respectively. Nine of 12 colorectal cancer studies demonstrated increased risks with higher red meat intake. Meta-analysis demonstrated a 17% increased risk of colorectal cancer per 100 g/day of red meat consumption.",5ffb1114-c593-4cae-bddc-30200e100edc
35,results41," An indication of increased risk of colon and rectal cancer was seen, but was not statistically significant. The WCRF update identified 13, 11, and 10 studies of the association between processed meat consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer, respectively. Ten of 13 colorectal cancer studies demonstrated increased risks with higher processed meat intake. Meta-analysis demonstrated an 18% increased risk of colorectal cancer and a 24% increased risk of colon cancer per 50 g/day consumption. There was a non-significant indication of an increased risk of rectal cancer. WCRF concluded that red meat and processed meat consumption is a convincing cause of colorectal cancer. No additional studies or SRs contradicting these conclusions were found in the updated search.  We identified no relevant studies of the association between red meat or processed meat and inflammatory markers.",f0850d5a-13fe-4a58-9722-7915dc57bcc7
36,results42,"  Five studies of iron status were identified, only one of which met the quality criteria (graded B). The RCT by Szymlek-Gay et al. demonstrated that increased intake of red meat among 12 to 20-month-old toddlers improved the iron status (66). Based on this SR, the evidence was rated insufficient and no conclusion was drawn. No additional studies or SRs contradicting these conclusions were found in the updated search. ",a8410840-1417-40b1-a144-7502417b1566
37,discussion0,"This SR focused on original research articles treating five food groups common in the Nordic diet, that is, potatoes, berries, whole grains, milk and milk products, and red and processed meat, and their associations with health outcomes. A sufficient number of studies meeting the predefined eligibility and study quality criteria were required to make judgements regarding the scientific evidence concerning these foods’ influence on health and wellbeing. Because of limited numbers of studies, conclusions could only be drawn for whole grains, milk and milk products, and red and processed meat regarding certain research questions. This SR found moderate-grade evidence for a probable protective association between high whole-grain intake and the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, whereas low-grade evidence indicated a suggestive protective association between whole-grain consumption and colorectal cancer risk.",2041db66-ecf2-470b-b142-a1b9aeb9388d
38,discussion1," The evidence grade was also low for high dairy intake, indicating both a suggestive protective effect against type 2 diabetes and a suggestive increased risk of prostate cancer. However, this SR concluded, based on moderate-grade evidence, that dairy products are not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The evidence for positive associations between red and processed meat intakes and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was considered insufficient, so no conclusion could be drawn, although some studies reported a clearly increased risk. Based on the WCRF/AICR review, we conclude that red and processed meat consumption is a convincing cause of colorectal cancer. Results for all other research questions were limited and non-conclusive.",1e55d467-5b49-46f6-8f46-c18ab7e3b16b
39,discussion2,"  The major strength of this SR is its predefined set of methods: all reviewers used the same predefined eligibility criteria to identify and select articles, and followed the same procedure to extract information from each article and to evaluate study quality (3). To date, very few published reviews have used such strict and objective criteria to judge scientific evidence in nutrition research. The procedure implemented by the current review project is adopted from procedures developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, (and Quality (AHRQ)), US Department of Health and Human Services (4, 5), and WCRF/AICR (2).  A clear limitation of the SR is that very few articles meeting both the eligibility and quality criteria were found, partly because the literature search included only studies published after 1999. This lack of qualifying articles restricted the possibility of drawing conclusions.",faacd72f-6ab2-4d22-8bb7-cd853dc84a6c
40,discussion3," Even though the number of studies focusing on food consumption rather than intakes of specific nutrients has increased in recent years, more articles potentially meeting both the eligibility and quality criteria would likely have been found if a longer time period had been covered. The SR was restricted to considering original research articles. Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses were included only if these applied eligibility criteria and quality assessments to the reviewed studies similar to those applied here. With regard to the quality grading, very few of the eligible original articles were graded A, most being classified as B (or C). Moreover, because of the three-grade quality system, grade B was assigned to studies of a wide range of quality levels. It is important to note that, because strict eligibility and quality criteria were used, some studies may have been downgraded or excluded because information was lacking regarding certain study design features.",fcefeec3-2f71-4dbd-9b43-78d074aff737
41,discussion4," Thus, the apparent lack of high-quality studies may to some extent depend on the limited information provided by authors. The undue influence of measurement error and confounders is always a danger in nutritional epidemiology; however, the quality assessment performed likely minimised such influences.  The SR identified very few studies of potatoes and berries. In addition, because most of those studies were conducted in the United States and very few were set in the Nordic countries, the applicability of the results is limited. Potatoes are traditionally consumed boiled (not deep-fried) in the Nordic countries, so both the quality and quantity of exposures may differ between populations and studies. Similar differences likely exist for berry consumption between Nordic and other populations; for example, the effect of sea buckthorn berries, which are not a common food item in the Nordic diet, was examined in two out of five intervention studies.",aeb87304-bac2-4ce8-94e2-50daf3340eb8
42,discussion5,"  Whole grains were the only food group for which the evidence was rated moderate (i.e. for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes). Nevertheless, the definitions of whole-grain consumption and the amounts consumed varied across studies and populations. This may have hampered the drawing of conclusions for some of the outcomes, such as colorectal cancer (low–grade evidence).  Dairy is a heterogenic group of foods that may have varied and opposing health effects. A need was identified for more detailed hypotheses regarding milk and milk products, and for studies focusing on specific dairy products. A report from the Danish National Food Institute (67), reviewing cohort and case control studies of dairy consumption, considered high consumption of milk and milk products to reduce the risk of stroke, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer, and probably to increase the risk of prostate cancer.",e9a1a6d7-1ef5-40d8-ad94-2c3ed11b75a1
43,discussion6," However, the Danish report concluded that milk and milk product consumption did not affect CHD risk and did not increase the risk of breast cancer.  The endpoint diversity in the reviewed studies of the association between red and processed meat intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) contributed to the conclusion of insufficient evidence. An SR and meta-analysis (65) including papers from the 1990s until 2009 concluded that consumption of processed meat, but not red meat, is associated with higher incidence of CHD, whereas another SR (63) graded the evidence as insufficient for a causal relationship between meat consumption (not specified) and risk of CHD.  Two recent meta-analyses and one comprehensive review by Alexander et al.",170c4298-9abe-4ea1-97c3-fe1b36ca6709
44,discussion7," (68–70) of processed meat and red meat consumption and colorectal cancer found summary relative risks similar to those found by the WCRF/AICR, but concluded that the available evidence was insufficient to support a clear positive association between processed meat and colorectal cancer. However, the review did not meet the criteria for SRs and was partially funded by meat producer organisations.  The WCRF/AICR advocates increased consumption of plant food at the expense of animal food products, red and processed meat in particular (2, 6). Since it is well known that meat consumption is an important contributor to iron intake, there is concern that limiting red and processed meat consumption may put certain population groups at higher risk of mineral (i.e. iron) deficiency. In this SR, the only relevant study included found that increased intake of red meat among 12 to 20-month-old toddlers improved their iron status. More studies are needed to be able to draw firmer conclusions.",aeac03f2-0e7d-477a-a6fd-f11d1afd040f
45,discussion8," In a recent Nordic project (71), the overall nutritional consequences of lowering the daily consumption of meat from current levels to the level suggested by the WCRF/AICR (i.e. under 500 g cooked red meat/week, very little if any processed), with specific emphasis on reducing intake of processed meat, was assessed. Tetens et al. demonstrated that the current intake level (mean values of groups stratified by age and gender) of red meat is not far from the WCRF-recommended level at the individual level according to national dietary survey data from the Nordic countries (71). When modelling a scenario of the total average diet at the group level where the intake of processed meat was reduced to 0, the re-estimated nutrient content indicated little effect on iron intake. However, the study did not include toddlers, and it was noted that it must be considered that the bioavailability of dietary iron may decrease with decreased meat intake.",13d65a68-a075-4589-9033-96a1dfde3637
46,discussion9,"  Until now, few published intervention studies have examined the health impact of specific Nordic diets (72) or of diets planned according to Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) guidelines using ordinary Nordic foods (73, 74). These studies have consistently demonstrated important health benefits for intermediate biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). As descriptive studies have revealed the detrimental qualities of foods included in current diets in northern compared with southern European countries, with low vegetable and fruit consumption and higher intakes of sweets, pre-prepared food products, and animal foods in the north (75, 76), the need to identify the health-contributing factors of the traditional Nordic diet is even more pressing.  To conclude, there was not enough evidence to draw any conclusions regarding the health impact of potatoes and berries based on this SR.",129af625-826f-41f1-9963-4466ad7996f6
47,discussion10," There was probable evidence (moderate-grade) that whole-grain intake was protectively associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This SR also found suggestive evidence (low-grade) that dairy consumption was associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and with increased risk of prostate cancer. There were too few studies to draw any conclusions regarding red meat intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In addition, the WCRF/AICR concludes that red meat and processed meat is a convincing cause of colorectal cancer. This SR revealed the need for more high-quality studies of the specific features of the Nordic diet.  Conflict of interest and funding The author has not received any funding or benefits from industry or elsewhere to conduct this study. =",12b6dd8c-9779-4ff8-bf83-31a33eb565ad
