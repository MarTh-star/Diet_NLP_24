"Foods to avoid","Red meat","['9', 'methods9', ' The two principal goals for intervention arms were a 5–10% weight loss and an increase in the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, i.e., a dietary pattern characterized by high consumption of olive oil, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fruits and nuts, moderate consumption of poultry, fish and dairy products, low consumption of red meat products and sweets, and low-to-moderate consumption of wine as the main source of alcohol accompanying main meals (Supplemental Results Table S1) [22].', 'c93d98d2-7c8c-4f19-8d58-0533bd283ec8']"
"Foods to avoid","Processed meat","['15', 'discussion0', 'We have found that prior adherence to a typical Italian Mediterranean diet, measured with the Italian Mediterranean Index, was associated with a lowered risk of weight gain (in people of normal weight at baseline) and a lowered risk of becoming overweight/obese 6–20 years later. High score on the Italian Mediterranean Index was also associated with lower gain in waist girth and lower risk of abdominal obesity. These associations were marginally influenced by specific components of the Mediterranean diet. Thus, when low red and processed meat consumption was removed as a component of the Index, the resulting diet was no longer “protective” against either overweight/obesity or abdominal obesity. Furthermore when high pasta intake, and low soft drink intake were removed, the resulting diet was no longer protective against abdominal obesity.', 'a8f29d7f-6650-4789-80a2-535aef5e6655']"

"Macros: Percent of Fat","30-35%","['4', 'methods4', '  (2) The Mediterranean Diet–high meal frequency (MD-HMF) group, which was instructed to adhere to a Mediterranean Diet based on a distribution of macronutrients of 30%–35% fat (mainly mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids from extra virgin olive oil, nuts, and omega-3 containing foods), 25% protein (mainly from vegetable sources), and 40%–45% carbohydrates (50%–70% of the total carbohydrate intake should low on glycaemic index and rich in fiber). This diet was previously observed to reduce fat mass and overall weight and improve general oxidative stress in patients with the metabolic syndrome [16], providing high Total Antioxidant Capacity (Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC)), and focused on the chronological distribution of meals, as factors, such as meal frequency and distribution could aid in reducing the feeling of hunger, thus improving compliance to an energy restricted dietary regime [17].', '931f94d8-43e1-47f6-9bf2-6a4388e92fc1']"

Mediterranean diet  Based on an updated systematic review of the core compositional elements of a Mediterranean diet14, the study required patients in the MD group to consume 15–20% protein (low-fat dairy, poultry, fish, legumes, nuts, red meat) in their daily food intake, 45–50% carbohydrates (vegetables, fruits, whole grains), and 25–35% fat (especially from olive oil). In this MD, the daily minimum requirements of vitamins and minerals were expected to be included with the food and beverage selections; therefore, supplements were not added.  Diet follow-up  Demographic information, anthropometric and biochemical measurements, liver size, and gastrointestinal issues were assessed carefully before and after the diet. An interview was conducted at the hospital outpatient clinic to evaluate the nutritional status of the patients in detail on the 7th and the 15th days after the start of the study.', '6d059142-d366-4834-8769-3f0153a1a69b']"

Daily intake of nuts and extra-virgin olive oil was suggested, whereas that of processed foods, bakery, candies, trans-fats, and sugars was discouraged.
