Key products were provided to the study participants in both groups. The participants in the Healthy Nordic diet group received whole-grain products, for example, various breads, berry products as frozen berries (e.g. strawberries, black currants, bilberries) and dried powder as well as dietary fats including rapeseed oil- and vegetable oil-based spreads.

"Macros: Percent of Fat","25-40","['4', 'introduction4', ' According to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR)s, the recommended daily energy distribution (as energy percent, E %) for macronutrients is: 25–40% of total energy intake should be derived from fats, 45–60% from carbohydrates, and 10–20% from protein (7). Since the ND includes several countries, the food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) slightly vary for every Nordic country. The daily quantitative recommendations for fruits, vegetables, starchy foods (wholegrain cereals or wholemeal alternatives), fish, and red meat are somewhat similar, while milk and dairy products are not specified in quantitative recommendations for all countries, but all are in concordance that low-fat dairy products should be the preferred choice. All countries advise using “softer and healthier fat” like plant oils and soft margarine, and limitation of salt to 5–6 g/day. An average daily intake of 1.5 L of water or other unsweetened liquids is recommended (9).', '8576e27d-e576-4a42-8525-f5420affae26']"
