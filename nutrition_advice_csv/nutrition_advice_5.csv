Ketogenic Diet  The ketogenic diet (TD.130659; Envigo Teklad Diets, Madison, WI, USA) comprises 15.1% protein, 2.4% carbohydrate, and 72.2% fat by weight, yielding a fat to protein+carbohydrate ratio of approximately 4:1. Fats in this KD yield about 90.3% (Kcal) of energy. Protein and carbohydrates yield about 1.4% and 8.4%, respectively. Standard rodent chow yields 24% calories from protein, 60% from carbohydrate, and only 16% from fats.  2.4. Macrophage Polarization  Bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice and cultured in CSF (40 ng/mL) for 5–6 days to generate M0 cells.
