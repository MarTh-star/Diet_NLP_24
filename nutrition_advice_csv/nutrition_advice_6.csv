However, such products could be consumed as an exception to the diet.  The KETO group followed a multiphasic protocol, with exclusive initial use of protein meal replacement products (Therascience, Monaco, Principality of Monaco) and at least two daily servings of non-starchy vegetables. In addition, according to guidelines, omega-3, multivitamins, and multimineral supplementation were prescribed [76]. Each meal replacement product consisted of approximately 18 g of high-value proteins per serving; therefore, the number of products used daily was proportional to the protein requirement indicated by guidelines as 1.2–1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight [76].', 'bc773099-2691-4ec7-a0d9-0d03ae35d134']"
