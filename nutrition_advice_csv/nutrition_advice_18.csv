For each of the components, study participants were categorized into quintiles 1 to 5 based to their intake ranking (Fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains); for example, 1 point for quintile 1 and 5 points for quintile 5. For sweetened beverages, salt, red and processed meats, the highest quintile was given the score of 1 and the lowest quintile was given a score of 5.', '5a3e987c-6b17-42aa-9bfc-e61d560f89cf']"
