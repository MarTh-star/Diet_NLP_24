In this MD, the daily minimum requirements of vitamins and minerals were expected to be included with the food and beverage selections; therefore, supplements were not added.  Diet follow-up  Demographic information, anthropometric and biochemical measurements, liver size, and gastrointestinal issues were assessed carefully before and after the diet.
