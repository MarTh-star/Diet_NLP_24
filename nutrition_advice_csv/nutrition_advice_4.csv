"Percent of Protein","15","['7', 'methods7', '  Each ketogenic meal was composed of 35% fat whipping cream (Coop, Basel, Switzerland) and chocolate-flavoured protein supplement powder (Sponsor Whey Protein 94, Wollerau, Switzerland) to accomplish a total fat content of 80 wt%. The corresponding macronutritional composition of both products is summarized in Table 1. Four meals accounted for 75% of the 24-h energy expenditure (24-EE in kcal/d) of the individual’s daily calorie requirement determined by multiplying the resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure (REE)) of each volunteer with the physical activity factor. The resting energy expenditure (REE) is calculated using the revised Harris-Benedict formula [41] which provides a quite accurate estimate in non-overweight subjects [42]. The physical activity factor is based on the physical activity during working and free time [43].  3. Results and Discussion 3.1.

Our dietary recommendations and handouts were similar to those used in the study by Klement et al. [14]. Our subjects were provided with handouts summarizing the main aspects of a KD and given a list of suitable foods with very low carbohydrate content. Furthermore, the subjects shared cooking recipes and links to helpful webpages on an internal weblog. They were free to follow a KD according to their personal preferences but were advised to eat ad libitum but limit their carbohydrate intake to a maximum of 20–40\xa0g/day to derive at least 75%, 15–20%, and 5–10% of total energy from fats, protein, and carbohydrates, respectively.', 'cbbde58b-12f2-4944-8467-41e87f213b9c']"
